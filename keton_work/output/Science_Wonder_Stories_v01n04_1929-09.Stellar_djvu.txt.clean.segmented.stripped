the author of the radium pool has come forward with his latest offering written in a style sure to arouse your enthusiasm
it has often been said by our foremost scientists that life is possible under the most adverse conditions
seemingly the human race finds it possible to propagate as easily in the north polar regions as under the broiling sun of the equator
on the other hand the human race can endure at some of our highest mountain tops where the lack of air is notable and humans can exist deep caves for years without being the worse for it fail to read this story
by walter kateley
the author of this story was formerly connected with the patent office and is for that reason well qualified as a science fiction writer
he has given us a most excellent interplanetarian story of a different sort
not all interplanetarian stories have to do with space flyers and the visiting of other planets by earth men
this story is one that deals with a new and novel theme one that will hold your interest due to its captivating charm as well as its unusual array of scientific ideas
by stangland
that the idea of suspended animation is not mere fiction is best proved by the fact that you can take fish and other animals and freeze them solid and keep them in this condition for a considerable length of time
after thawing they seem to be as welloff as before
other animals notably bears can hibernate during the entire winter months without being the worse for it
mr stangland has enlarged on this theme in a most surprising manner and incidentally has created a rattling good story that cannot help but keep your intense interest
by edward chappelow
here is one of the most daring stdries of imagination that we have read in a long while
it is one of those stories that grows upon you as time goes on
it not only gives you a world of information on a subject of which not too much is known even by our foremost scientists but provides a source of the most interesting speculation about the possibility of there existing worlds within worlds ad infinitum
we then may well wonder what part of the scheme our world consists of

by greatest sources of wonder are not those that we see or those indeed we know but those which are hidden from us and are going to be known only as we progress on our long and tortuous road to the future
if we contemplate the world as it was let us say years ago in the day of the caveman this truth must beoome most apparent to us yet it is often overlooked or not at all manmade work from the modern skyscraper down to the most intricate chronometer that we have today was existence years ago in its integral parts
all the raw materials were there as they are today
nothing has been added to the wealth of the earth during the last years with the possible exception of some falling meteorites
yet humanity at that time was nothing more than a race of animals emerging from a long sojourn in savagery
everything that spells our civilization today was hidden from our ancestors
it safe to presume that it will always be thus and that we who call ourselves moderns of today have hidden from us just as many things as our ancestors had hidden from them years ago
it is true that in the last years more things have been revealed to the human race than in years preceding this epoch but even now we have as yet not scratched the surface of the possibilities of nature or come anywhere near the limit of our progress
there are immeasurable treasures surrounding us treasures in power treasures in foodstuffs and other treasures necessary for lifebut we do not use them because we do not know how to get at them
as late as a hundred years ago people in england as well as pennsylvania were burning wood in the winter to keep warm because they had always done so yet they built their houses right on top of coal veins which they assumed to be only a form of rock
it took humanity over years to arrive at the point where it burned this rock and found it would give them heat
this of course sounds ludicrous to us today yet we are just as foolish when we insist we must burn coal in order to make steam of it which in turn is used to run our turbines which turn dynamos which produce the current to light our electric lamps
in this process we lose exactly of the available power and only of of the energy is turned into light the rest escapes in heat and other losses
untold sources of power are lying right at our own door but as yet we are unaware of it
if we had the key to unlock the secret of atomic power for instance every single pebble in your backyard could be turned into enough heat light and power to keep your house supplied for years to come
but of course we havenot got the key because as yet it is hidden from us
yet we need not go as far as atomic power
there are probably and scientists have suspected this for many years jnany other sources of power surrounding us which as yet have not been harnessed
there is for instance gravitation there is the pressure of light there is the electric energy that comes direct to us from the sun in addition to the radiant heat a vast source of power as yet only little understood
it takes generations of steady plodding to discover some of these hidden sources of power
one for instance that probably will become a tremendous factor in the future the socalled cosmic ray was recently discovered by professor milliken
we know practically nothing about it as yet but from the little we have seen we suspect it is a terrific power that some day will be tapped to the benefit of humanity
the sources of energy created by the differences in temperature around us have never been tapped
only recently a frenchman proposed a most unique plan whereby a tremendous amount of power can be taken from the oceans through simply taking advantage of a small variation of temperature existing between that of the sea level and that a little distance below the surface
then there are the tremendous sources of solar heat the tides winds and others which although they are known to us might just as well be hidden away because wo have as yet not the sense to make use of them
yet each of them offers enough power to supply all the needs for the entire planet
fabulous wealth will be made in the coming generations by those who will tap some of these hidden or unused sources of power and add them to our natural resources without ever fearing in the least to deplete the source
coal and oil for instance will some day give out whereas the solar heat the tides radiant heat and other forces will keep on giving energy for literally millions of years to come
i made a machine which would enable me to look right through the wall of the colony house
now could see the life lived there and hear it too and obtain the harmony between sight and sound the latter part of april during a visit to new york i was entertained tae evening by mr and mrs hugo gernsback
they had done me the honor of having me to dinner in their home instead of the more formal surroundings of one of the great metropolitan hotels
after dinner the three of us discussed various phases of social life in new york
i admitted that the city had its charms but that personally i should not care to live amid the constant din and confusion
mr gernsback laughed at me as he said but you should come to see us more frequently
everytime you come you secure ideas for several stories admit that i replied
for example large blocks of conversation in stenographer hands were obtained from your conversation
at the same time you must admit that some of the ideas in my stories are original
the hard thing is to get new idea
just one absolutely original idea makes a story possible
my host pondered for a moment and then walked over to his library and picked up book
here he is an idea for story
this book is the white ant by maurice maeterlinck
he tells about the termite and suggests that the conduct of the individual ant may be controlled by a central intelligence and that the mitary is one large a animal
gernsback halfseriously then suggested that all life may be way and that human being may be controlled by a central intelligence
he felt that this may count for the that individuals in different parts of the world often do the same thing at almost the same much of what we are in life and the greater part of what we do is made possible by the previous efforts of some worker who may have all unknowingly laid the foundations for our achievements
it is therefore with due appreciation that this work of sciencefiction is dedicated to maurice maeterlinck author of the white ant david keller time
for example he went on elisha gray and alexander graham bell working independently arrived simultaneously at the idea of the telephone and submitted the invention to the patent office within an hour of each other
darwin and charles buell announced from different parts of the globe their conclusions regarding natural selection at practically the same time
let me read parts of this book to you
for fifteen minutes he read to me while i sat in an easy chair with closed eyes
finally he said you take this book with you and read it
there is a big story in it
i give you one idea
all you have to do is to work out the details
yes i replied that is but that is a good deal some times ready for the typewriter
it was written at white heat and finished in less than two weeks
mr gernsback was kind enough to say that it was my best science fiction story
but he quite naturally believes that it could not have been written without his idea
editors that way nfortunately true edi
and i am conceited enough to feel that even with the idea he needed me to write story
dr keller infers that the editor could never have written the human termites even though he had the idea
the editor cheerfully admits this
as a matter of fact few authors could have written such a marvelous story as dr keller has editor this at least is the way one story came to be written
david keller book which inspired the human termites had just returned from a residence of many years in africa
there he had lived the solitary life of one who is occupied in solving a certain mystery of life and cannot be content with any other occupation or satisfied till a solution of the problem has been attained
such men have made our civilization possible they are not good companions on account of their intense introversion but on the rare occasions when they can be induced to talk about their work they are always able to astonish their audience with their erudition and complete mastery of their life work
such a man was souderman
for some reason early in life he had been stimulated to entomological research
for years he had followed in the footsteps of forel charles janet lubbock wasmann and maeterlinck
he had learned all that these masters of insect life had to teach him but because he was born of woman he was not satisfied with this knowledge
there were too many gaps in the knowledge of his teachers too many places where they said do not know he realized that he could not fill all of these gaps unravel the twisted thread of all the mysteries of insect life that had puzzled them but he did feel that life was going to be a failure to him and completely unsatisfactory unless he made at least one contribution to the knowledge of the insect world
the work of forel and maeterlinck intrigued him but left him restless unsatisfied and discontented
he wanted to find one fact that was unknown to them solve one puzzle that they had been unable to fathom
it is typical of the man that he made a calm and dispassionate survey of the entire world of insects before he decided on his life work
this review of the unsolved questions of the littleknown part of life formed by the insects brought him face to face with the termite and its destructive powers
in the annals of entomology he read of the destruction of the french town of la rochelle by termites from san domingo which had come in the vegetable mould in the hold of sailing vessels
every street was attacked
before the danger was realized most of the houses fell down
the archives and all the records were destroyed
the devastation only stopped when the termites reached the canal of la verriere
in a spanish warship was literally eaten to pieces by a swarm of termite divers while anchored in the harbor of ferro
in these same minute insects destroyed the batteries and munition of the french forts in the antilles and made the defence of those islands against the english an impossibility
souderman found that large portions of australia and ceylon were uninhabitable because the termites ate the crops faster than they could be grown
europe was protected by its temperature were it a tropical land the termite might destroy even the greatest of the cities of that land
they have to live in a temperature ranging from to degrees centigrade
below degrees they die
the more souderman read about these tiny blind insects the more fascinated be was by the many startling peculiarities they possessed
he no longer felt the bee the wasp and the ant were the intellectual leaders of the insect world but slowly came to realize that the termite possessed a something resembling human reason which placed it not on a level with man but perhaps in some ways above him
so he decided to devote the rest of his life to a study of the termite
severing all relations with his european associates securing an income from one of the large research endowment funds he went to south africa to study the termites not by observing them but by actually living with them
this is a form of scientific investigation that is rare but which never fails to repay for the years spent in its pursuit
some day all the take pleasure in presenting what we be rr lieve to be dr kellers greatest work so far
that this story will cause a furore and endless discussion seems certain
it embraces a tremendous subject and incidentally enters into realms that are as yet but little understood even by our foremost scientists
but you may be sure that some of the greatest mysteries that surround us and even permeate our very bodies will be solved during the next few hundred years
for instance as maeterlinck asks in his book the white ant what intelligence governs our own bodies
you cut your finger and the ignorant person will say that it starts healing at once
but the process of healing means that the instant the breach is made in the skin innumerable thousands of minute white bodies called corpuscles immediately rush to the breach and start fighting the germs that enter the opening while new cells are being built up immediately to close the breach
neither the human intelligence nor the human will has anything to do with these processes which go on at all times within the human body
all we know is that some intelligence evidently directs these things but who or what this intelligence is no one knows
whether it is our littleunderstood socalled soul or something else no owe knows
indeed it is not at all impossible that the members of the entire human race must be considered simply as separate cells of a great organism
they have no will of their own but are fused into a homogeneous body with nothing but intervening air to separate
that this may be true could be illustrated in many ways
war for instance will quite often change an entire nation overnight as if by magic and also change lifetime habits and ideals of its people almost as quickly
religion fanaticism and other passions are similar evidences of the transmission through an entire nation or nations in many instances of ideas without visible communication between individuals
all these things may be explained by purely logical natural reasoning without resorting to the supernatural as indeed the author has pointed out in this memorable work
it is certainly a work that will commend itself to the earnest attention of every thinking questioning person questions in the scientific world will be solved by such men as souderman trained laborers in the world of the unknown who are willing to sacrifice everything to obtain an answer to one mystery of life
something about souderman workers have been few
the price that has to be paid is too great
everything has to be abandoned
a lifetime has to be spent to attain one little fact
and yet the men who do this feel that the attainment of one addition to the store of human knowledge is sufficient reward for all their sacrifice
and it is
suppose one man spent a life time with the cancer cell not merely studying it but actually living with it
he would think of nothing else during his waking hours and dream only of it during his sleep
month by month and year by year he would become more intimate with this enemy of the middleaged
to him the cancer cell would become a separate race of living creatures a parasitic enemy of mankind
he would learn its history its folklore its traditions
the cancer race would slowly reward his efforts by allowing him a few glimpses of a separate intelligence comparable to that of the human species
time would pass and it might be that old age would come on and still the secret of prevention would remain a mystery
as a last resort he would deliberately inoculate himself with the cancer cell make of his own body a laboratory so that he could make a last final effort to gain an insight into the soul of the individual cell the group intelligence of the cancer mass
others would consider him insane a recluse introverted by the study of years an unfortunate dying of the very disease he had spent years to study
yet even on his death bed he might whisper the great truth which would make the human race free from this parasite that now kills one out of every four who reach the age of forty
surely this man would die happy in the thought that he had contributed one fact that would make the life of his race happier
that is the great sacrifice
every generation produces one voluntary victim
such a man was souderman
he went to africa when he was he came back when he was during those years his loved ones in germany had died most of the scientists he had grown up with were solving the puzzles of another world
saddened by the realization of the changes in his social life still horrified at the final revelations of his african studies he decided to go to new york and there place the results of these years of sacrifice in kindly hands before his death made it too late
he was not satisfied with the definite knowledge he had secured in africa for he realized that it would be useless unless he made it available to the betterment of the human race
for when the final truth had dawned upon him it had made him afraid
fear is not necessarily an attribute of ignorance
the greater a mans knowledge the more intense may be his fear not the blinding fear that shows in the panic of the submerged masses but the keen appreciative intelligent foreseeing fear of the scientist who combines that emotion with an intense desire to prevent a threatened calamity
and because of this intelligent fear mankind has checked the black plague reduced the incident of yellow fever and made smallpox no longer a scourge that could kill one out of every three of the population in less than a year
souderman knew that he could not die till he communicated this fear and the facts behind it to a few scientists who could appreciate the terror of it
the knowledge had to be the common property of a small group of men who would be willing to guard it a terrific secret through the generations till the time came for action
then and then only could the antidote be used the means of defense slowly perfected
and perhaps unknown to the masses once again human life on this globe would be saved through the sacrifice of many generations of unsung and unwept scientists
the student of termites came to new york
he then visited chicago and philadelphia
his record his knowledge made him a welcomed guest in the homes of all those who worship at the feet of minerva the goddess of wisdom
the german scientist talked little listened intently and observed much
finally he found one man who had the peculiar mental qualities and the scientific foundation and vision necessary for an accurate appreciation of what souderman had to tell him
this man had youth enthusiasm and an excellent education
in addition he had a respect for the aged
the old man at times wished that the course of his life had made it possible for him to have a son like that
subconsciously he adopted him
having finally found his man he spent a few months in becoming acquainted with him in learning his mental reactions to the great events of life
he wanted to leave this man all the knowledge accumulated in those long years of african residence but he did not want to make any mistakes
he had a secret to tell but in order to make that secret safe he had to know just how to tell it and in order to learn how to do this he had to study the personality of this youngster who was to become not only his pupil but finally his heir
adam fry i is interesting to note that there were many men in america who were more brilliant than adam fry
there were scientists who had forgotten more than this young man knew
but adam fry had one trait that souderman considered necessary for the complete understanding of his secret and that was imagination
that was a trait that many scientists lacked in fact most students of the world felt that imagination had no part in their life work
yet souderman had developed his imagination and by means of it had come to at least a partial understanding of one of the worlds greatest secrets
and he felt that unless his heir possessed the same peculiar mental trait he would not listen to what might seem the ravings of an old man
he wanted a man with the combination of galileo and the farseeing vision of jules verne a scientist who understood insect life as fabre and maeterlinck did and yet had the imagination of wells poe or gernsback
in adam fry he believed that he had one of these peculiarly combined personalities
at least he was sure that the young man would understand
and that was why souderman had been worried until the day he met adam fry
he wanted a scientist a man given to imagination and at the same time a man who would understand the half truths half dreams of an old man
he had lived so long an introverted shutin life among the termites that he was sensitive of criticism could not stand disbelief and ridicule
he bad come to america to find a man and in a few days after meeting adam fry he knew that his search was ended
the reactions of adam fry to the older man were all pleasant
in a singular way he had always been accustomed to respect age and the mere sight of this wornout shriveled old man who had spent a lifetime in isolation awoke an intense pity and even love in the young scientist
he felt that this man knew something and to the youngster all knowledge was sacred
he desired nothing more than to learn what this whitehaired man bad to teach and regretted that his comparative poverty made it impossible for him to spend a few days or a week with him
with these thoughts it was a gratifying shock to learn that the old man had money and was anxious to adopt him as a student for the rest of his life
all of financial worries could cease and he was to be paid an adequate salary to do nothing but listen day after day to souderman and from time to time write a complete statement of the conversation
this statement was to be put on pure linen paper with indelible ink that would last for ages and two copies made one for the congressional library in washington and one for the public library in the city of new york
they were only to be accessible to members of the american academy of natural sciences
adam fry listened to the plan proposed by souderman and at once resigned his position as a chemist in the bugtox laboratory
the two men decided to rent a small apartment overlooking riverside drive do their own housework and cooking and with the exception of regular hours spent in necessary exercise in central park to devote their entire time to the completion of this manuscript
souderman did not feel that he was in the best of health
he did not fear death but he did dread the thought of dying before his lifes work was securely placed on paper and burned into the mind of his pupil
hans souderman was so impatient to begin his story that he could hardly wait till they were installed in their apartment
he had impressed on his adopted son for so he was fond of considering him the necessity of having a permanent ink
they also decided not to cover more ground each day than could be written twice before the beginning of the next days talk
adam fry trained as he was through years of scientific work to take notes made a beautiful task of assembling and arranging in logical sequence the old mans conversation which at times was rather rambling and disconnected
the completed manuscript can be examined by anyone who cares to take the trouble to do so though it tells only a part of the complete and final story resulting from the work of years of patient toil completed by souderman in africa
story story as told the young man by souderman during these daily conversations arranged in some order and avoiding repetitions was about as follows in order for you to fully understand the end of my work adam you will have to listen while i tell you something about the beginning of it
perhaps you know something about it
if you do you are indeed an exceptional young man
i went to africa many years ago to study the termites
many people think that they are ants and their common name is the white ant but they are very different from the ant
it is not hymenopterous and therefore has no close relation to the ant and the bee
it is usually classified in the order of orthoptera orthopteraid newroptera neuroptera or pseudoneuroptera of the division corrodentia
some consider it an entirely separate class and term them the isoptera
there are probably from to distinct species but probably not more than three hundred had been identified and properly labelled
i have the honor of isolating more species than any other one man but why not when i have spent my life living with them
they are very old
one hundred and fifty species have been found in fossil amber
go back a million years and there were the termites
go back to the endless night of the primary and there is the termite associated with the protoblattidae
some men have placed their beginning one hundred million years before man appeared on this globe
surely a very respectable age
during all this time they have lived and through these countless ages they have adapted themselves to their surroundings and necessities
otherwise they could not have survived
man supposed to be a most intelligent creature has just begun to learn a few of the things that the white ant has been doing for millions of years
but they are able to live efficiently in many ways which we are ignorant of and yet though the knowledge might be beneficial to us so far we have been unable to learn the secrets of their lives and apply this knowledge to our own
doomed to a existence in darkness they have adjusted themselves to the life of the blind out defensive armour weak pitiful little things they have perfected an architecture so secure and build their houses of material so strong that they could not be broken into by any of their natural enemies until man came with tools of steel and dynamite
unable to secure a sufficient supply of natural food they adjusted themselves to a diet of cellulose wood fibre
this they either use as spawning beds for a distinctive kind of mushroom the volvaria eurhisa and the xylaria nigripes
these mushroom beds they cultivate carefully preventing the growth of other unfavorable species
in other forms of termites large numbers of flagellated protozoa are found in their intestinal canal
the weight of these protozoa is often one half the total weight of the entire termite
the termite eats cellulose and the protozoon digests it
in doing so it dies and itself forms food for the host
these protozoa the trychonympha campanula are found nowhere else in the world only in the intestines of the termite
they build their homes of intestinal secretion mixed with small particles of sand or vegetable debris
this forms a wall that is hard and a perfect protection against their natural enemies
their houses are perfectly ventilated and at the same time kept warm by some heating system probably generated by decaying vegetable mould
while they need moisture they are enabled to live in tropical countries where the rain falls very seldom
do they make water
or conserve it
who knows
at least they have all they need
compared with their size the height of their buildings is enormous
suppose man was to build according to the same scale
then his houses would have to be feet high something that so far has never been attempted by the race we are so proud of belonging to
in architecture they show the most astonishing variation especially when you consider that all of the actual building is from the inside out
their houses have spires domes columns fagades they imitate every known geometrical shape known to mankind but they go beyond that and become so grotesque that it would seem that some mighty mind had fashioned thefh in and during an attack of delirium tremens
they not only build houses but they build tunnels
destroyed by the light unable to defend themselves in any way they go enormous distances for food and always through tunnels of their own construction
at times enormous colonies are connected by tunnels apparently for no other reason than a desire to form a social contact with each other perhaps some union political and economic
they have solved the problem of food
everything they touch can be eaten
they eat their dead the useless members of their colony they even eat repeatedly their own dejecta
nothing is wasted nothing is useless
in time of surplus they place little piles of food in corners
certain workers have nothing to do but to supply food to other groups of their political organization
they continue their group life by hatching and caring for the eggs and young of the queen
she is an enormous creature ten or fifteen times larger than her subjects
she simply lies in the royal cell and for a life of five years she lays one egg a second thirty million a year or one hundred and fifty million in her lifetime
when she grows old she is eaten and replaced by a younger queen
the eggs are fed different foods and consequently develop different kinds of termites
some have thought that there are as many as fifteen different kinds carefully differentiated and shaped according to the work that they are called upon to perform
some are workers others inside policemen and still others soldiers
a few are specially fed to become future queens others to be the husbands of queens
i want you to remember that these are all raised from the same kind of eggs and they are produced according to the need of the colony
if soldiers are needed then they are produced till the need is supplied
do you see anything wonderful about that
compare it with man the socalled intelligent creature
what can he do
a man and a woman can produce a child
they can not even determine that childs sex
it will be some kind of a child but can they make a musician an artist a mathematician out of it
can they determine its shape before it is born
the termite does all that and more too
it has successfully solved all the problems of life
the community it lives in is a dark sad and gloomy one but it is highly efficient
the individual is in every instance sacrificed for the group
it is russia magnified and idealized a million times
but they have survived through the ages
for ten million years the ant has been at war with the termite but the termite still survives
it lives on not as an individual but as a colony
who directs it
souderman goes to work a single acre in africa there may be twenty colonies
each house seems to be separate and yet there seems to be an uniform rhythm of life
they do things in the same way and at the same time
some naturalists have thought that this can be called instinct
that all the deeds of this wonderful little thing are without intelligence
fabre said there is no reason in the wasp no real mind in the bee no intelligence in the ant and yet the termite is far above these lesser creatures
fstudied this matter
was there an intelligence
if so was it an individual or a group matter
perhaps there was an electrical phenomona something resembling the contact of our neurones and dendrones
i spent years searching for an answer
for a while i thought that the queen headed the group but i learned that she was subject to the same immovable laws that governed all the rest
she was simply a highly specialized glorified worker and when her usefulness was over she was killed and eaten just like all the rest of the colony
there seemed to be some occult power some ths theory that termites might communicate with each other by means of substratum vibrations usually not audible to the humaa ear led to the construction of the apparatus described below
a more extensive paper on the subject of termite communication will appear later but it is thought that an account of the method of detection of substratum vibrations of termites might have a more general interest at this time
the inside of a telephone transmitter consisting of the carbon eup and screw to which the diaphragm is attached was connected to four dry cells
the primary of a ten to one ratio audio transformer was sopertermite intellect directing the affairs f each hottse
i hunted for it and for years i could not find it
i tried to apply every known physical and metaphysical law to the problem and all that i attained was failure
twenty years passed
during that time i had done nothing but live and think and study termites
i tried to become one of them
i felt that if i could only put myself in the place say of the queen that i could understand the mental reactions of the unit the house the colony better
i got nowhere but to the depths of despair
i felt pitifully dumb ignorant helpless
i was on the outside separated from the great truth not so much by the colony wall but by sheer lack of intellect
these little termites helpless blind small were living a mental life so complicated that a great scientist could not begin to understand it
then i suddenly wondered about the noise
for there is a noise that comes from the colonies
some think that it is music
others call it cracklings tictacs whistles cries of alarm if the ear is placed on the wall of a termite colony these sounds are plainly heard
i had known of them for years
now it came to me like a stroke of lightning that perhaps they could be interpreted
up to the present time i confess that much of my work had been simply the observation of the average insect student
i had carefully duplicated the methods followed by other men and had devised a few methods of my own but there was nothing very original
with my new desire ta interpret the sounds that came from the termitary came a new
vox head mono showing section of miarophena and itn base connected to the microphone and batteries while the secondary of the transformer was connected to the input terminals of an audio amplifier such as is used in radio work
aa unirectron ampli fier was used in this case and an ordinary pair of head phones was connected to the output terminals of the amplifier
the diaphragm was removed from the telephone transmitter and a piece of the wood inhabited by the termites was threaded on the diaphragm screw the termites crawling upon the wood jarred tb this article from the june issue of science is evidence of the remarkable coincidences of the thoughts of widely separated people
both dr keller and the author of this article began working on this problem at about the same time
it illustrates also that this work of dr keller is already showing its prophetic insight as it is engaging the attention of serious scientific workers vision
other men had tried to saw openings into these houses to even blast them open with dynamite as a reward they had only the partial satisfaction of seeing the inside of the termitary in a state of hopeless confusion it gave them no real idea of the life that was being lived there under the usual circumstances
what should be done was to study the life without disturbing it observe it through the unbroken wall
that was my ambition
thanks the new improvements the science of the amplification of sound i was able to assemble a rather satisfactory apparatus
first there was a bell shaped stethoscope a little similar to the instrument used by physicians to examine the heart
it had a rim of soft rubber which had little holes in it
when this was pressed to the wall of a colony house it remained there by suction
inside was a diaphragm
i had the sound augmented radio tubes and finally given to me by a loud speaker
now all i had to do was to sit in my observation tent and listen to the sounds that were being formed in the termitary
natural the first instrument was not satisfactory
the little fellows promptly ate it
they are the most remarkable eaters that i have ever seen
they eat everything
in australia they ate beds carpets foods of all kinds and even soap
it was thought that if the foods were put in tin cans they would be protected but they worked at the tin literally corroded it with a juice they secrete and then ate the rusty metal and the food inside
they think nothing at all of eating carbon grains thus altering the current from the dry cells
this produced a sound which ws amplified to the extent that a termite walking on the wood could be heard through the head phones
it was found best to mount the microphone button and attached wood on a piece of sponge rubber in order that outside vibrations jarring the table or floor would not register on the apparatus
after several hours of observation some soldiers of eeticulitermes fiavipes kollar became disturbed and were thus stimulated fo hammer their heads upon the i wood
this performance could be plainly seen at the same time that the amplified noise produced was easily heard through the head phones
this action on the part of soldiers of reticulitermes fiavipes has never before been recorded to our knowledge and we imagine that the sound would be almost impossible to hear under natural conditions
audible sounds made in a similar manner have been detected among several genera of kalotcrmitidae rhinotermitidae and termitidae before but there has been some confusion in the literature as to whether the sounds were caused by hammering the head or by some stridulatory apparatus
experiments conducted by the senior author how ever seem to indicate that termites hear air vibrations very poorly if at all while at the same time they are very sensitive to substratnm vibrations
this fact together with the definite proof that the head hammering produces a distinct substratum vibration tends to support the idea that these insects communicate with each other through the nest material
probably the asymmetrical mandibles of capntermet and allied genera are modified for making a substratum vibration by snapping the mandibles
at these substratnm sounds are generally associated with disturbance it is thought likely that they are utilized as symbols of danger
the jerking motion of termites commonly observed did not register enough vibration through the substratum to be detected in the apparatus and there seems to be no indication that this action is a method of communication by sound although evidence points to the strong possibility that termites communicate by means of this jerking motion possibly by meant of an odor stimulation
there is tome indication reported by dr snyder of the bureau of entomology that excessive substratum vibration frequently produced will deter termites from occupying certain situations
crossties of railroads with heavy traffic and buildings occupied by cotton machinery in motion seem to be immune to attack and the above experiments indicate the reason
robert simpson or pmeatmett through lead of any thickness
they can finally go through a glass wall
naturally they made short work of my first acoustophone but i fooled them
i made a study of the cement they used in building was able to make a fairly good imitation and covered all the apparatus with that guess they thought it was a part of their colony house at least they did not try to eat it
now followed long days of study
i realized that my life was not long enough to do all the research especially when it came to the interpretation of a new language so i enlisted help
the poor fellow was a wonderful linguist but he just hated bugs of all kinds so i made hundreds of phonograph records for him and let him study them in comfort in his house at cape town
it was odd
i did not even tell him what they were records of just told him that it was a new language and that i would like to see if we could isolate it and obtain some meaning as to what it was all about
the conclusions he reached after two years were astonishing and were very useful to me in reaching my final conclusions
working independently of him i was able to isolate certain sounds but as i had no idea what actions were accompanying those sounds i at once saw the need of actually seeing what those little fellows were doing
that made me undertake a special study of the physics of light rays
i left africa and went to france and a frenchman and i made a little machine that would enable me to look right through the wall of the colony house
it had some of the principles of the xray but was far easier handled and a great deal more satisfactory
its penetrating power was only three feet but that was better than nothing
now i could look into different parts of the colony house
i could see the life lived there under normal conditions
and it was my hope that as i saw that life lived and heard it lived that i could obtain some harmony of purpose between action and sound
questions that at last i would be able to tell these termites were able to think
some of their actions pointed to intellectual processes
of course fabre did not think so but i felt that some of my observations would have made him change his opinion
of course instinct may become very complicated but is it not possible that the human intelligence is after all simply composed of millions of complicated automatic instinctive acts
we learned the language of the termite
at least we thought that we did
you remember that i said that the philologist in cape town simply knew it was a language but did not know that it was a language of ants
the poor fellow went wild over it
he said that he believed it was the oldest language in the world and the parent tongue of all human speech
he isolated root words established derivations and finally wrote a glossary composed of over five hundred words
that was what i wanted
i made a few hundred more records for him promised that i would finance his book when he was ready to publish it and then went back to my own work determined to learn and use this new language as soon as possible experimented for at least two years
for example i took a very sharp auger and bored a hole one inch wide through the wall of the house that i had my acoustophone attached to
now i was able to look into that house and hear into that house and note their reaction to this opening of a hole
as usual a number of soldiers came out and formed a solid ring around the sides of the hole
then workers came each either dropping a globule of liquid cement or a small piece of sand
within an hour the opening was closed
were these orders given
did some supreme mentality realize the danger and close the opening by giving orders
i procured an ice machine and literally froze or tried to freeze a small portion of the wall
i had a thermometer in the wall but there was no result
the termites simply rushed large masses of fermenting mould to that spot and in spite of my efforts they kept the temperature to a point where they could live
was that intelligence or instinct would bore you with a detailed study of all these experiments
at last i came to some very definite conclusions
each termite had some nervous system
they were able to understand certain sounds and originate certain sounds
these sounds were used in a way to resemble speech at least they served as a means of communication
but there was no sociability and the conversation seemed to consist mainly of orders
some power issued orders and the millions of occupants of one termitary said yes sir and at once obeyed
then i was faced with a new problem
whence came these orders what constituted the initiating force
here was a plunge into the realm of the unknown a leap into the darkness of the great void
for listen to me and pay attention adam fry to this next statement
these colonies are thousands of years old
perhaps one house is a million years old
how can we tell
they are enormous things
earthquakes cannot destroy them or tornadoes break them to pieces
cattle wander at will over them and on their tops enormous trees grow for it is a peculiar fact that they hold all vegetation growing on their colony houses as a thing sacred and not to be eaten
listen to me
man since the day of magellan has sailed and walked and flown around the world
they have gone up in the air and down into the deep seas
the north pole has been looked at and the south pole will soon be a commonplace
where has man not been
everywhere
no
there is one place that the foot of man has never been one place the eye of man has never seen and that is the real inside of a terminary
what is there
how deep do they extend into the ground
what we see may be only an outer shell
these are the questions i asked myself
i knew that they were old
was the intelligence governing them old
the life of the human being is but a trifle compared to the race history of the termite
i felt that in all these million and hundreds of millions of years that they had attained to mental processes that we could only imagine
so far i had seen only the carrying out of orders
the termites seemed to be but servants
where was the greater mind
was there a mind
if so how old was it
was it superior to my mind
could we communicate by this time i knew the five hundred words
i had isolated sentences in fact i was beginning to talk their language
for example they had certain sounds to indicate that a hole was broken in the wall and that it must be repaired
i reproduced that series of sound that termite sentence on a phonograph and then transmitted it by vibration through the wall
i watched the result through my visual apparatus
at once the soldiers came to guard the opening instantly the workers came with their liquid cement
of course there was no hole to repair and there was a resulting confusion
i waited a day and repeated the experiment
once again there was confusion
on the third day there was no reaction
attaching my acoustophone i carefully bored a hole in this same colony house
at once there was an order given but it was not the same as i gave
some new sounds had been introduced
the soldiers and workers obeyed at once and closed the hole
here was a novelty
someone had learned that their orders were being duplicated and consequently their orders from the inside were changed and the workers instructed to pay no attention to the old form
i went to another termitary and gave the original order
there was no response
then i gave the new order and for two days it was obeyed but on the third day it provoked no reaction
do you see anything odd in that it seemed to me that the supreme intelligence in the first termitary had communicated the news of the complication to the supreme intelligence in the second colony house
i went one mile away and the result was the same a hundred miles and there was no difference
the great discovery worked a game of chess with this thing ruled the colony house
i would live the receivers of the acoustophone in my ears and by a specially ingenious invention i learned to talk to the termitary with such a changed voice that it was an exact duplication of the tone used by the insects
and gradually it dawned upon me that there were two languages being used
one for the issuing of orders and the other dare i say it for the communication of the supreme intelligences of the various colony houses
when that idea dawned upon me i went rushing down to cape town
i was growing old and there was no time to spend in isolated working
to my surprise johanson in cape town had arrived at the same conclusion i had namely that there were two languages
he had been so stupi fied at the idea that he felt it almost impossible to put it into words but when i blurted out the same thought to him his tongue was loosened and for lover an hour he spoke as though touched with the divine fire
we talked over the matter for a day and here is our conclusion
the termitary has two languages
one is very simple and is used only for the giving of orders
the other is vastly more complicated only imperfectly understood by the soldiers and workers and apparently used as a means of communication between the intelligences of different colony houses
johanson hated insects
he just naturally could not stand the thought of an ant crawling over him but he came with me to my termite colonies and i will give him the credit for staying there two weeks
then he left me
the work we accomplished during those two weeks placed me on the threshold of the great discovery ceased to worry about the lesser language
in fact i found that the vibratory scale of the two languages was so different that i could tune in the greater language and tune out the lesser one
on the day i started to do this i was nearly years old
and the thought came to me irresistible tremendous aweinspiring that the words i was hearing were being uttered or produced by an intellect that was perhaps a million perhaps ten million years old
and i was trying to understand it a nothing a mere speck of timeunity of years was trying to understand and analyze and study something that was perhaps alive when my ancestors were crawling reptiles or something less
but i had the urge
i could not eat
i was unable to sleep
nothing would satisfy me but the knowledge of the ultimate
and when i was i heard them talk and understood them
do you see what that meant to me
for two years there had been no experimental work i had attempted nothing new i had simply sat there in a chair or rested on my cot with the receivers in my ears
i learned the language
and then the great idea came to me
this termitary with the millions of termites all carefully differentiated in shape and ability to perform the various forms of work required for the successful functioning of the colony was not composed of millions of individuals but was simply one large animal
the colony house was the skeleton changed according to the growth of the animal and its needs
think this over well
one large animal
does it mean anything
think of an animal a million years old ten million years old
imagine the wisdom that it would have accumulated
and these little things we called termites they were just so many cells in the body of this animal
with the conception of this fact i realized that i was faced with the wisest most remarkable life that had ever appeared or would ever appear on this globe
all the forms of life that had been coincident with it had disappeared unable to withstand the changing conditions of earthly existence but the giant termite had survived
the palaeozoic types were all gone
the pterodactyl mammoth cave bear sabertoothed tiger had all failed to adjust themselves
but this animal i was thinking of had slowly conquered continents and was threatening europe and northern america
and i was studying it alone unarmed incompetent i had the temerity to place my intellect above that of a million years
other lives were gone but they lived on
they had met with a cunning patience changes in moisture temperature sources of food
in every instance their intelligence had been sufficient to provide security against a threatening danger
in all the studies made by over fifty careful observers only one termitary was found lifeless
thus there was no death rate
they lived on and i believed that their ambition was to finally rule the world
that gave me food for thought
i knew that the area they lived on was slowly expanding
now and then new cities fresh agricultural areas were overrun
was there a method back of this
could they plot prepare and premeditate an attack each one was hopeless in its stationary position
it could not move but it could form new members
across the field it would send a cement tunnel and through this blind tunnel the workers would go perhaps for a hundred feet and there a new colony house would be erected
i saw that happen
for two years i saw such a house grow and during all those two years it was ruled by the intelligence from the first house and then oh you must believe me for this is one of the greatest of proofs the tunnels were broken the two houses became separate and in the second house was a second intelligence and it was not a new form but had the wisdom and apparent endless age of the first
was it a part determined that what i had seen was simply a budding a cleavage a peculiar form of birth of a new individual
and thus by slowly establishing new individuals all with the same mentality they hoped to conquer the world
an amazing conversation silent
as i said for over two years i did nothing but listen
and finally i could stand it no longer
their plans were so heartless so coldly diabolical maddening in their cleverness and deadly in their ability to wait for a thousand a million years if only at the end of that time they were able to rule the world and drive out all other forms of life it was all so horrible that i just had to do something
you will remember that i had never tried to talk to them
but now i determined to do so
i formulated a phrase in their language and i vibrated that phrase through the walls of a hundred colony houses in the immediate neighborhood of my laboratory
i said this is a large world
there is room for all
why try to destroy all other life f and then i went back to my favorite termitary replaced the acoustophone and started to listen
and what i heard was this
i wrote it on a piece of paper and put it in my wallet
it was fortunate that i did so
here is the paper and here is the message
for a long while we have been studying you
because of this we have tolerated you
now you must leave can tolerate no interference with our plans
for years i had been unmolested by the termites
here was the explanation
to complete their knowledge they had to study man
in order to do this they had to have a man near them
they could not catch a man and make him a source of observation
for all these years i had obliged them by remaining in one place
i thought that i was studying them whereas the truth was they had been studying me
for once in my life i was absolutely at a loss as to my future conduct
restless i went to bed
the next morning after a bad night of dreams i woke to find my laboratory a wreck
everything was gone eaten cut to little pieces
my records apparatus food supplies were gone
my clothing was eaten but i had been spared though the cot i slept on even the mattress was a complete wreck
they had told me to leave and this was the final warning
i had the clothes on my back some memos in my wallet and that was all
of course the very valuable phonograph records were safe in cape town
at least i thought so
i hurried there but i was too late
poor johanson had been attacked the same night only he had been killed literally eaten alive by millions of warrior termites while his records in fact his entire house was a wreck
i was horrified and at the same time i knew that my life might be the next to go
here was time for deceit
i arranged to leave cape town on a certain steamer
i told dozens of people that i was going to do so
i even went out to a colony of termitaries and shouted the news and then at the last minute i left in an airplane
that ship sank the day after it sailed from cape town and all on board were lost
divers examined the hull and found that it was literally eaten to pieces by termites
looks as though they tried to get me
i do not think they can in new york city
it is too cold but they are working on the problem of living in cold climates
they have to solve that and then they will creep over the world
so there is my story and there is the danger
johanson could corroborate it but he is dead
our records are destroyed
only my intellect survives and i am now an old man
well adam fry cease writing and tell me if you believe it
the young man smiled certainly i believe it
why not
at one time i studied medicine
the anatomy of the human body is proof that you are right
for days i have been listening to you describe those colony houses and all the time i have been thinking making use of my imagination trying to compare your termite organization with the human body
you have made the comparison one worth while
you told me when we first met that what you wanted was a man with imagination a young man that could think outside the beaten track
well i will reward your search and i will make a statement
the only difference between the termitary and man is one of age and intelligence souderman laughed almost hysterically as he grabbed his student and kissed him on either cheek my dear boy my real son
you see it
you see it
you saw the analogy all by yourself
i wanted to have you do that
for nights i have been praying that you do this
i did not want to tell you for that would spoil it all
only by arriving at this conclusion separately could you show me that you were worthy to share my secret
now i can die happy for i know that you will go on and on
with the foundation i have laid you will be able to build a superstructure that will astonish and perhaps save the human race from a future terrible destruction
i believe you are right
i believe with you that there is an universal pattern of life of which the combined life of a single termite colony is the oldest and most remarkable form
it must have been the oldest form and all the other life on the earth since its development must have been foolish efforts to imitate that type of life
with what success or failure you can judge
we think man has been the great achievement of the ages
to the ability of the great termite we have added locomotion
what else
nothing
does the giant termite know anything man is ignorant of
my boy when i think of his intelligence and our ignorance i have to laugh at the colossal asses we are making of ourselves
for years i studied the termite
i was thrilled at my discoveries and at the fact that my apparatus was untouched and then i suddenly found out that i was the one they were studying and when they were through with me they destroyed my work they killed poor johanson and in their efforts to get me they wrecked a large steamer
they are simply waiting
time with them means nothing
and when they have learned the little things they need they will come north and when they do all other life will vanish
they are selfsufficient and need no allies
for millions of years the real ant has been fighting thejn but what is the result not in a single instance has the black ant been successful
warning about a single pattern of life
we are a form of termite colony only we are infinitely lower than the giant termite of the tropics
we live sixty seventy years and then we are dead
i wonder if the real termite knows what group death is
we prate of our nervous system our red and our white corpuscles our muscle bone and digestive cells but are they under the control of our wills
not at all and yet in the case of the giant termite every function is absolutely governed by the central intelligence
it is true that when our outer wall our skin is broken it is repaired by our workers but what a poor process that repair is in comparison with the repair of the wall of the termite colony house
everything we do is childlike puerile infantile compared to their profound efficiency
if we knew what they knew we would be able to prolong life indefinitely become efficient in any line of endeavor
our problems of life nutrition housing disease the temperature of the body all these things would be simplified
we call ourselves human beings in reality we are simply a collection of a number of interrelated but at the same time independent cells living within a colony wall called the skin and so far we know absolutely nothing concerning the real governing of these cells by means of the higher intelligence mind or of the central nervous system
the central intelligence of the giant termite issues direct orders to all the individual cells which form his body
consider them as cells or as individual living creatures little termites whatever you please but no matter how you call them they are absolutely under the control of the central monarch the of that colony
can we do that
if our liver cells are sick can we make thousands of new ones
if there are too many white corpuscles the policemen of our blood can we order that one third of them be destroyed and eaten for the public good can we form new human beings you say yes but will they automatically be possessed with the accumulated power and wisdom of the past hundred million years
how about the idiot the epileptic the defective we procreate
there is none of that in the giant termite
man knows a lot but when he comes in conflict with these stationary animals who have serenely wandered down from the past aeons he has to surrender
he cannot live with them or in fact near them
they strike in the dark but when they finish there is no place for the man form of termite
some day they will come
we will be blindly going to the movies amusing ourselves talking through the air listening to the radio dashing over the roads in our automobiles aimlessly like so many cockroaches or flying in the air like blundering beetles
we will die as a race before we are able to appreciate what has killed us
perhaps for some centuries a few of the human beings will survive shivering around the poles
i see it all and you will too because you have imagination but who else will see it can the race be warned they cannot replied adam fry
they will almost kill themselves laughing at us if we try to warn them
tornadoes they understand death from war and tidal waves destruction from famine and pestilence they have at least read of but that whole nations should perish through the silent working of a creature that they would only see as a small helpless defenseless blind white ant they will not understand
they are too grandiose too sure of their position in the world they live in too confident that they are selected by god to rule the world
they are even confident of god
but the race must be saved insisted souderman
we are men
it is incomprehensible that our brothers should be so stupid but we must save them in spite of their asinine lack of imagination
i say that we must save them
in reality you must because i will not be here much longer
you have the secret
in the little time i have to live i will teach you all i know and then as you grow older you must teach some one else
perhaps when the real test comes when there is the final struggle the one man who is our descendant might save mankind
that is some measure of responsibility know but it has to be assumed feel said adam fry slowly as though he was not sure of his statement that the first thing we should do is to preserve your knowledge of the language of the giant termite
i do not mean the command language spoken to the warriors and laborers but rather the language used by the central intelligences when they were talking with each other
you surely know it by heart at least you have enough of it so you could make phonographic records or perhaps better still teach it to a few philologists so they could make a written language out of it
then there is another idea which can be developed in the course of the next few years
i feel that your work was cut short and that it is incomplete without an effort made to actually find and see one of these things whatever you might call it which is the head the actual intellectual force behind the animal you call the giant termite
i feel that something might be learned if one was actually captured
if its knowledge was so superior to ours perhaps some compromise might be reached
how about it
your first idea is a good one replied the old scientist
work once done need not be repeated
many years of my life was spent in the endeavor to learn this peculiar language
if some one repeated that work it would be simply time wasted
it will be an easy matter for me to make phonograph records and i could also teach it to you
perhaps we can enlist the aid of a real linguist who will work out a grammar and a vocabulary
we will think about it
in regard to your second suggestion it opens interesting possibilities
of course you realize that i left africa the way i did because i felt that some one should know the secret and i was convinced that the giant termites were going to do all they could to stop me
they killed johanson
of course some would call that a coincidence but i feel that it was the tremendous effort of a gigantic intellect to preserve secrecy
i have tried to imagine what such a thing looked like but i have failed
perhaps one could be located and captured but it looks impossible to me
of course we could drill into a termitary and blast it with dynamite and thus we might get to the bottom of the animal but it might be that this would only result in its death
perhaps they are psychic and when we found everything we would have to confess that we have actually found nothing
it might be like the thing we call a soul
we think that there is a soul but in the autopsy room on the dissecting table where is there a trace of it
i have thought of a gray mass round with convolutions shaped like the brain of man but what would it be like without its body
could it live on naturally we could not capture an entire colony and transplant it
no someone who knows more than i do will have to undertake the problem of determining what the actual central intelligence of the giant termite really is
i know the danger of it the shrewd vast intelligence of it the ability it has to bide its time and adjust itself to changes of its externals
but i cannot even guess what it looks like or how it can ever be conquered
the first invasion there is nothing like trying said adam fry bluntly
nothing can be accomplished without the primary effort
suppose we get the language put into an imperishable form and then some years from now i may go to africa myself
i want you to make a map of that region for me
i want to go there and locate that special giant termite you talked to the one that threatened you if you did not leave them alone the one who said he had been studying you
perhaps i could catch him
all that spring the two men worked and on into the summer
phonographic records were made maps were drawn detailed blue prints showing the various scientific instruments used by souderman in his years of african study
as soon as adam fry was able to sustain his share of the conversation the two men talked in the termite language first perfecting themselves in the language of the workers which souderman called the command language and then advancing to the speech of the giant intellect used only in intercommunication between the egos of the different colonies
the young man worked harder than he had ever done before in his entire adult life
gradually the two manuscripts neared completion and finally they were finished
the one was sent by express to the congressional library at washington while the other was in a drawer waiting to be carried to the new york city library
the men had decided to take this valuable document in person to the librarian and explain to him the importance of it
they had decided to do this the first of august
it was an interesting sight to see the two men on that morning
the one old stoopedshouldered and whitehaired and yet with the gleam of youth in his eye the younger man keenly alert physically capable of any exertion brilliantly equipped in every way to play the part in life that fell to his lot
they wore red neckties this morning and were freshly shaved
souderman even insisted on carrying a cane
he cried that a man was as old as he feels
they ate a hearty breakfast of soft boiled eggs bacon toast and coffee
then they prepared to start out
but when they opened the drawer the book was gone
it was a manuscript book the pages and soft leather cover held together by steel rings
these steel rings were in the drawer
the two men looked at each other
at last souderman said with a deep sigh
the summer has been hot
then he pulled the drawer wide open and pointed to a long tube the size of a straw and about the same color that stretched from one corner of the drawer over to the middle where the book had been
termites he whispered
adam fry looked at him as though a thousand questions darted from his eyes
but all his tongue could say was coincidence
the old man smilingly shook his head we might fool ourselves by thinking so my lad but with the giant termites nothing happens by accident by coincidence
no this is simply the first attack of the enemy
it might not have happened in the winter but they have taken advantage of the long and very hot summer
how did they locate us
you cannot think
where is your imagination
i am sure that they did not look me up in the telephone directory
but now is not the time for morbid introspection and idle speculation
now is the time for action
here is the thread of life the channel through which the attack was made
suppose we try to follow it downward
they probably came up through the leg of the table
i recall now that it has not been moved since we came here
suppose we tilt it over on its side
there see that hole in the bottom of that leg
now where did it connect with the floor
just as i thought
there is the hole
now somewhere in the ground under this building is the main body of the giant termite that was assigned to this work
can you imagine the cunning the intellect the enormous mentality of such a being
immobile not capable of changing his home he yet devised methods to be carried to new york by ship locate himself in the city find us here satisfy himself that i am the man he has been seeking
then he established stations for observation in our rooms
no doubt every word we said all of our plans perhaps for all i know even our thoughts were understood appreciated and stored in the storehouse of memory
we think that we were shrewd in placing one copy in the congressional library
perhaps even now a giant termite is waiting there to destroy it when it comes
well boy our partnership is over from now on our only safety lies in separation and rapidly moving from place to place
fortunately we duplicated the phonograph records
we will each take half of them
i am going to secure a skilled linguist and go to some cold country like labrador and teach him the termite language
you do what you think best but be careful of yourself because one night will ruin your hopes
do you still think that they want to kill us
they had a thousand chances do not know
they never tried to hurt me so long as they thought i was not going to fight them
just as soon as they considered me an enemy they came close to destroying my life
adam fry sighed do not want to leave new york yet
i have an idea that i want to work out
then i will be satisfied to go to africa and see what i can do there
i tried to imagine all you told me but these later developments show me something that before seemed only visionary and fantastic
i feel that you are more than right
all these giant termites need is some sure defense against the cold and they will overrun the world
they may not kill mankind but it is possible that we may be reduced to abject slavery a life of raising cellulose and mixing cement for our masters
are you going to try and find this individual termite that is living somewhere under this building
no replied souderman vigorously shaking his head the best thing to do is to pack our things and get out
suppose we spend three hours tracing this slender hollow tube of cement to the basement
by the time we return we might find the entire surface of every phonograph record smeared with a glasslike cement and utterly ruined
we had better leave
i said out loud that i was going to labrador and you said out loud that you would stay in the city
we had both better change our plans and think them instead of saying them
perhaps they are able to read our thoughts
perhaps not
but you have ample funds and all i know you do
you go ahead
the safety of the human race lies in your hands
finding the man the loss of any more time the two men packed the most valuable of their possessions and left the small apartment that had been their home for so many interesting months of companionship
it was not till they were several miles away from the apartment house that they ventured to speak
they went into a small cafeteria that was humming with the noise of a thousand busy customers
buying some rolls and coffee they sat down
then souderman took out a paper and pencil and wrote an address on the paper will be here if you want me he whispered and handed the paper over to adam fry
the young man looked at it a long time memorizing it then burned it and placed the ashes in his coffee
fine he commented
there could be no better place
i will let you know from time to time how things are going my dear master and take care of yourself
and so they parted
the young man took his heavy bundle of records and went to a cold storage plant that made a specialty of taking care of furs and other perishable valuables
he left the phonographic records of the giant termite language there and walked out on the street
to all appearances he looked just like any one of ten thousand men he passed every few minutes
there was this difference
he knew what danger menaced them and he cared they neither knew nor cared
he was on his way to save them
he went to a cheap hotel and registered for hours
once in his room he simply sat and thought
he had the beginnings of an idea and he wanted to find some one who would have sufficient mentality to take that thought and push it over into actuality
even as souderman had hunted for a man with imagination so was fry searching for a supermind an intellect that would be able to think in channels hitherto unknown to mankind
the young man felt keenly that the saving of the human race was the responsibility of souderman and himself but he wanted to enlarge the partnership
he felt keenly the need of a brain better trained than his in what
perhaps in sociology religion world politics
he hardly knew what kind of a brain the manner of a man that he really wanted but he did know that he could not rest till he had found the man and told him the story of the giant termites and the additional thought that he had which so far he could not form
so far he had to be content with the simple knowledge that the germ of the thought existed
fry reviewed the men that he had known the great men in the world who were really doing work of vast importance
there were scientists economists business men politicians world visionaries lawyers physicians psychologists and leaders of teligious thought
wherever he located in his mind a man of sufficient intellect he saw the man so engrossed with work that it seemed impossible to require of him the faking of one additional burden
rich men poor men industrious men giant intellects doing the work of a dozen average men the labor of a million morons
where among such men could he find a man who would willingly listen to a perfect stranger he saw that none of them would willingly listen to him but perhaps he could force one to for at least a few hours till interest made it impossible for the listener to break the thread of the narrative
with this new viewpoint he again went over the list of the men he knew or had heard of and finally selected a bank president
here was a peculiar choice
bailey bankerville was the descendant of the famous bankerville who had largely financed the american revolution
no one knew just how long the family had been financiers
perhaps they originally came from the vank de ville family and everyone knows that they were the financial power behind william the conqueror when he conducted the campaign that conquered isolated england
bailey or 4th as he was known to his intimate friends had become the head of the family on the early death of his father
he had handled the affairs of the enormous corporation with the greatest ease by finding capable men to do the work for him
consequently he had found a sufficient time to play and he had done so
his play would be considered by other men as work
for example he spent a large sum and a year of his life making a careful study of the monoliths of easter island
when he finished this he was easily the worlds best authority on these enormous remains of a people long since dead and forgotten
his book on the subject printed in a limited edition of twenty volumes is one of the most prized works sought by anthropologists
with nothing but stones to work with he formed a theory of the life and habits of these people that no one has ever been able to controvert
this work which he laughingly called play was but one of a number of similar adventures in which he sought to wrest from mother earth her secrets
he had been so busy doing this and at the same time augmenting the family fortune that he had no time to play in fields feminine
so far he knew woman simply as the female of the genus homo
he was fairly well familiar with her attributes as an entity but never willingly sought the company of any woman except his mother and sisters
this was the man that adam fry picked out to finish the thinking of his great thought
fry knew the man had imagination boundless perseverance and an education that equipped him to at least follow the bare outline of any scientific discussion
the problem of the man being solved the next question was how to meet him
that became far more serious than appeared at first thought
making him listen was artistic and therefore temperamental
to a great extent he was a man of moods quick to react to little peculiar stimulations
when fry sent in his card and asked for an interview the banker was annoyed
he had eaten salt mackerel that morning and it was repeating in a very gastronomical way
he saw the name and he asked his private secretary
is he small or large
when the man answered that the visitor was a trifle small he at once reacted with the phrase small fry a poor fish if i see him once i will never be able to get rid of him
he will be a repeater like that damned mackerel
tell him i am busy
tell him i am out
tell him i refuse to see him
tell him anything you like but show him the door
adam fry came back the next day and the next
and never again at least not to the bankers office
the following saturday night the banker had a very uncomfortable dream in which there seemed to be an inability to move
waking he found that this was an actuality for he was securely tied to the bed and also gagged to prevent his call308 ing for help lit the dim light he saw a man at the foot of the bed and now that this man saw he was awake he started to talk am adam fry
i wanted to see you in fact i had to see you
i called at the office three times and you would not have anything to do with me so i was forced to visit you at your home
i am not a robber or a murderer my motive is neither commercial nor religious
i feel that if you will listen to me talk for an hour you will listen to me to the end
i hope that i can take the gag off and unbind you
will you agree not to call for help
the banker had a saving sense of humor
for a week he had been making fun of this man without ever seeing him
now the man had him
sure i will listen to you he said as the gag was untied
let me free and we will go to the library and spend the rest of the night
i think you are a bothersome interloper but anyone that is clever enough to pull this stunt is worthy of consideration
i suppose you are some new kind of bond salesman one of those gogetter devils
let me turn on the light and locate my bathrobe and slippers and for goodness sake put that gun away
it might go off and break something like a looking glass
hard luck you know to have a looking glass break
in a few minutes they were in the library comfortably seated in overstuffed leather chairs
bankerville offered a drink which fry refused saying you will think that i am drunk anyway before we are through
then adam fry started to talk to the banker
he first told all about the giant termites as studied by souderman
he was still telling about them when the butler entered the room to open the shades and let in the sunlight
bankerville jumped up with a start shave and dress
we can talk while we are shaving
then we will have breakfast
i will send word to the bank that i will not be there today
i never had so much mental sport since tige was a pup
i do not know where you have been staying but i know where you are going to stay from now on
you are going to be my guest
i do not know how much you have to tell me but you are going to tell it all before you quit
send for those records
they must be kept safe and i am going to send the best linguists i can hire to examine them and learn that language
you either are insane or you are up against the largest problem that ever hit mankind since the flood
you highjacked me into this and by the sacred cow of benares i am going to stay in as one of the leading actors till the play is finished
that is what i wanted you to do answered adam fry
he was greatly pleased
in fact he felt that now he could begin fighting in earnest
at the same time he realized that even though the rich man was thrilled with the story of the giant termites there was still a large question and a very important one to be answered
would the mans brain leap over the gap that had stopped the mental processes of adam fry
there was a secret there somewhere
fry felt it could see dimly the outline of a great truth but the final development was still an impossibility
it needed something better than a fry brain
would a bankerville intelligence suffice
the two men shaved and prepared for breakfast
at that time a rather startling surprise awaited adam fry
bankerville had a sister and that young lady susanne bankerville was very much in attendance on the two men
in any household news spreads like wildfire and the bankers sister greatly pleased at the idea of anyone actually hogtying her brother and forcing him to listen to a wildgoose yam had violated all feminine rules and was at the breakfast table charmingly clad and apparently anxious to make toast for the two men
up to this time bankerville and his sister had been sufficient unto themselves
clad in masculine attire she had accompanied him on all of his queer expeditions and the fact that she had obtained an excellent scientific education made her a very valuable aid to bankerville in his anthropological researches
she did not look very masculine this particular morning and that was entirely her own premeditated fault
she had lived with her brother for thirty years he being five years older than she
during that time she had never known of any man getting the best of her brother in any kind of a conflict
now the whole household was buzzing with suppressed curiosity and it was no wonder that she made herself very charmingly feminine and waited with considerable desire the appearance of the dragon killer
adam fry was at a loss to know how to consider her after the introduction
could he talk freely or must he be guarded in all he said
bankerville lost no time placing him at his ease as he followed up the introduction with a long tirade concerning the real worth of his sister and at the same time what a tremendous nuisance she always was when they visited the faroff places of the earth
this young lady he began refuses to let me get out of town without her
ever since she started to walk she has been a tagger
she ran away from school to go to the easter islands with me
we never did find her till we were three hundred miles from shore
she would not have shown up then were it not for the fact that she became seasick
well that is the way it has been
when i am in new york she behaves mighty decent but just as soon as i get the wanderlust she insists on getting out her knickers and though i try mighty hard i cannot shake her from my trail
this is the first time in five years that she has had breakfast with me
why
because she smells a rat
she thinks that i am into something and she refuses to be left out
i do not know how she came to find out that i invited you to breakfast so we could discuss the new classification of shellfish but women are peculiar that way
she thinks that you are a boy scout or something and she wanted to meet you
she looks real cute now but you ought to see her in her war togs
yoti can say anything you want to in her presence she is absolutely to be trusted
and i will say this her brain is better than mine for she has feminine intuition
that was the end of his speech
susanne bankerville smiled and now mr fry tell me about the shellfish
giant termites my dear sister corrected the brother
do you know anything about termites miss bankerville asked fry certainly do not but do not mind me
you start right in where you left off last night or was it this morning or have you just begun
the information i have is so confusing
brother says he asked you to have breakfast with him and others say that your conversation started during the night
well let our guest eat and then we will all go to the library
i have sent for those records and when they come i will play them on the orthophonic know sister will like to hear them
she is wild about all those foreign jabbers
the rest of the meal was very quiet and almost formal
the young lady soon showed that she was the perfect hostess and adam fry was at once placed in a position where he had to acknowledge that he was having a very pleasant time
fry delivers a lecture after they were again seated in the library but at this and for that matter at all future sessions susanne bankerville was an interested member of the audience
there is no doubt continued adam fry that the millions of little blind termites enclosed in a colony house simply compose so many parts of one animal which souderman called for convenience the giant termite
i feel that for a correct understanding of our problem we must consider the colony as an outer shell or skeleton
the various workers warriors even the queen and her husband are all dispensable and replaceable but irrespective of the deathrate of the individual termite the giant termite lives on as he is always absolutely able to replace any of his dead individuals feel and that is what i told souderman to his great delight that all life follows the same primitive pattern
first there was one cell and then a number of cells united for offensive and defensive reasons
then the cells specialized
the analogy between the giant termite and all other life is interesting but perhaps especially so in man
the human body is composed of a number of individual cells
they serve many different purposes and like the individual termite can only do one kind of work
the termite works industriously at its task which was predetermined before it was matured
it can do nothing else
the corpuscle in the blood stream is similar the red cell carries oxygen under no circumstance can it do anything else
the white cell is a scavenger it cleans up the debris but never can it carry oxygen
the nerve cells carry messages but the muscle cells contract
all these millions of cells are contained in a skin just as the millions of termites are contained inside the stone wall of the colony house
the great advantage that the giant termite has over the human termite is the fact that it can send out its cells from the body proper and be sure that they will return
when our cells leave the confines of the skin they are lost
that is what happens when there is a hemorrhage
the individual cells go but they never return
they are absolutely lost
when we compare the control the central intelligence of the giant termite has over its individual cells to the control that the central intelligence of man has over his cells we are forced to acknowledge our pitiful inadequacy
what takes place within us does so without our knowledge control or approval
how different in the giant termite
occasionally our cells revolt die without being replaced new cells grow in a disproportionate manner and we die of cancer
at the best we live but a few years and then we die while the giant termite lives on
i doubt if it knows death
the giant termite is what it is today because for millions of years it has been made to fight enemies of life of atmosphere of bitter surroundings
it had to endure hunger privation danger and yet survive
in the short time man has lived what has he learned practically nothing
just one minute interrupted susanne bankerville
do i understand that each individual termite has a separate intelligence
they must have
i compare them to cells and yet the microscope shows that they are really formed of many cells
they have the ability to understand speech because they obey orders
they have a definite speech with words and yet they have no initiative they can do is obey
communism social discipline is carried to such a point that every one of them has to be finally sacrificed to the good of the community
they work for the central intelligence but have no part in any happiness or benefits
the entire social order is predicated on selfsacrifice of the individual in order that the mass the entire animal might live
another question
do you think that the cells within our bodies have a similar individuality a peculiar type of mentality
do they know anything
can the blood cell the little bone cell the muscle fiber think reason do anything but obey a nervous impulse
adam fry looked at the girl curiously as he replied honestly i do not know
certainly there is not the beautiful control of our cells that the central intelligence of the giant termite exercises over his individual termite cells
we cannot force our cells to perform certain acts
of course we can in a limited way as in walking but the efforts we make to manage the affairs of our body are pitifully infantile
we cannot even keep alive or well
yet every part of the work done by the giant termite is duplicated in our bodies
practically
but poorly
it is as though we were just learning as though after a million years we were just out of our infancy barely beginning to understand life
we are learning to talk but we lisp stutter utter thoughts in baby talk
nothing like that with the giant termite
how much do they know anyway growled bankerville
how can i tell souderman worked with them for years and he was completely nonplussed at the end
he even accused them jokingly of finding our apartment in new york by making use of a telephone directory
perhaps they have all the wisdom of the entire preceding ages
perhaps they know a hundred times more than we do
they certainly have perfected a bodily structure that is infinitely more remarkable than ours
they have by jove what an idea
they have put legs on their corpuscles taught them to walk instead of swim and then took away their blood liquid
their cells literally run around in dry arteries juiceless capillaries and yet are able to perform all the necessary work
the human female has an ovary bilateral
if all the conditions are right she may be able to reproduce herself but in doing so she is subject to a thousand adverse conditions
the giant termite reproduces at will any of its cells and when it is ready divides its central intelligence whatever that may be and forms a new individual
and i suppose your idea is that all life is like the termite only not so highly organized
something like that
it seems that perhaps the dog the fish bird human being are all simples forms of the termite colony
suzanne understands a while all three were silent
an oppressive silence seemed to hover like a mist over them
the sun which had been shining through the library windows was now covered by the fog that arose from the smoketortured city
for all his accustomed poise bailey bankerville started in to tremble
it seemed that he was tortured by the effort to think
the sweat started to break out on his forehead
dammit
oh
dammit
i am trying to think of something and it eludes me
something about us and the giant termite and i cannot get it out
can you help me adam fry cannot
i have had the same feeling for a week
that is why i came to you
there is something there that i ought to see but for the life of me i am unable to
i feel it
it just comes so far up to the threshold of consciousness and then it sinks back without crossing
i have been unable to sleep because of it
i thought you with your vaster experience in the mysteries of the world could fathom it
and then susanne bankerville jumped up and began to dance around the room like a twirling dervish
and as she twirled she sang have it
i have it
oh
i and she started to laugh hysterically
then she threw herself into her brothers lap and sobbed
the rich man looked over her shoulder towards adam fry mind her he said softly
she gets this way sometimes
i suppose that you would call it psychic or something
usually its very well worth while what she says when she is able to say
finally the sister sat up and wiped her face as she said
silly and all that but the idea was too big for me
but it is what you men were hunting for
i just know it is
you said mr fry that all life had a certain pattern and the pattern and the oldest and most perfect pattern was the giant termite
you said he was formed of millions of little white ants and then you said that each little termite was formed of little cells in making your comparison with man you said he was on a par with the giant termite but you gave him too much credit
he is simply on the level physiologically and psychically with the little termite
he has no initiative no spontaneous ability to control his actions
i cannot explain it but i believe that all the people in the united states are simply little termites the cities are large colony houses
the cities are connected with roads rails even air routes but over all the millions of inhabitants is a central intelligence that governs and directs
no he cannot be god not as i understand god
there is a central intelligence for each nation mexico france turkey germany russia
and the people of each nation are just like those poor little blind termites that sacrifice everything for the good of the nation
i do not believe that the central intelligence of the humans national animals is as clever as intelligent as the central power of the giant termite
they are not so old and they do so many silly things
russia is trying to put into force some of the habits of the termitary
they call it communism
now that is my idea
the two men looked at each other in silence
finally the rich man said not a very pleasant thought adam fry to feel that one and all of us human beings are just running around doing what we are told to do by a central intelligence that is not god and that has not even the brains of a giant termite
not pleasing but it sounds as though if was true
i feel that this is the thought i have been looking for
the world has to be saved from those white ants
meantime the human race poorly governed badly directed expends their strength fight ing among each other while all the time the termite terror becomes more real
the brother turned almost fiercely on his sister what do you mean susanne by a central intelligence governing the united states and another one governing mexico
do you mean the political power the combined thought and determined purpose of the people the will of the mass to rule a combined psychic impulse jointly held by the entire nation
nothing of the kind was the determined reply if life has one pattern and the giant termite is the pattern then everything you say is nonsense
mr fry says that souderman proved positively that the little termites were hopeless and helpless and all they had to do and all they could do was to obey the orders of the supreme intellect i think he called it the central intelligence
they do just what he or it says
the queen lays so many eggs and when he says enough they kill and eat her
the eggs are developed into so many workers so many outside warriors so many internal policemen so many nymphs according to his orders
if food has to be secured the colony defended a new termitary formed then he orders and they obey
if they are too many he commands that a certain percent be eaten
not in a single instance as far as i can learn from your talk and from what heard of book is there the least suggestion that at any time they are capable of independent thinking or action
in the scale of life in this uniform pattern of existence we men and women correspond to the little helpless blind insignificant termites and if this is true then we have nothing whatever to do with our government
we may think that we have but that is just delusional ideation if you will allow my phraseology
no doubt our president is selected rather like the queen termite is
when the central intelligence is through with him he is thrown out of tlje white house and killed as wilson was
well go on with the argument
this is growing interesting
we are all little termites and have nothing to do with our lives or actions
all is controlled by a higher central intelligence
is it god
no
less than god
of course
far less than even the central intelligence of one little colony in south africa
where is it will answer that said fry suddenly interrupting
one of the things that souderman failed to do was to actually see the ruler of a termitary
mark you he talked to one
he was convinced that there was one
he was sure that they were able to talk to each other and that there was perfect accord and a communicated harmony between them but he never saw one
he says that no man has ever seen the inside of a colony house
that is he means entirely
he did not know how deep they extended into the earth
but down there somewhere in the termitary was this central controlling force
i have the blue prints of all of his instruments the study he made of the two languages one the command tongue and the other used for the intercommunication of the rulers is preserved for us on phonographic records
souderman actually talked to the and talked back
now if all life has the same pattern and we could actually see this that rules a colony house then we might be able to at least imagine that something like that ruled the separate human termite nations
these things that rule us may be powerful but i fancy that to a great extent they are stupid
laying plans threw his sister off his lap and started to walk the floor
suddenly he exclaimed perhaps we are all wrong
surely if the three of us are just little helpless termites of humanity we are doing a lot of criticism of our central intelligence
we are doing a lot of independent thinking
perhaps sister is mistaken
that is a logical statement answered fry
but you must remember that the animal of which we are a part is still in a very experimental stage
i do not think that conversation dreams and criticisms such as we have been indulging in would be possible between three little white ants
they have had all such independent initiative crushed out of them by millions of years of communistic life
their motto is one for all
the all for one disappeared from their lives many centuries ago i feel that our seeming independence is simply a proof that the animal that we are a part of is in a very early stage of its intellectual development and we all know that man was nearly the last animal to appear on the earth
we are pleased to say he is the greatest and most highly developed while in reality he is probably the weakest of all the earth patterns just as the giant termite is the strongest
nevertheless since we have the thought that we are supreme we can at least play the game bravely
we may be governed by the supreme force i think schopenhauer called it the claude bernard spoke of a morphological plan another philosopher called it the of all causes i do not care what you call it personally am in favor of fighting the battle out to the end
we may get the worst of it
if we could look into the future we might recognize even now the hopelessness of the struggle but as it is why not fight
three of us all loyal to each other and consecrated to the betterment of our fellows
then there is souderman brave old man fleeing to a cold country so his knowledge can be preserved
he can be counted as number four
that sounds good to me said bankerville it has been a long time since i have had a vacation
time to start something
the more danger there is in it the better pleased i will be
any suggestions as to our line of attack think that we ought to try and solve the question of just what the central intelligence of the giant termite really is
that will help us in our effort to understand and influence the same motive or governing force in the human national termite if our idea that there is such a force is correct
i believe that an expedition to africa at the present time is sure to be a dangerous one but that is the only way to start it
i have the exact location of the giant termite that ordered souderman to leave the country
that is the one to go after
we will duplicate machinery for listening and conveying sound and then after we have learned the higher language we will talk to this and if we escape alive we may have secured sufficient knowledge to communicate with the central intellectual power of this nation and see if we cannot drive some common sense into his thick skull
miss bankerville you have been of the greatest help to us but you must not go to africa
you have no idea of the danger
if a man like souderman is thoroughly alarmed over the situation it is certainly no place for a woman like you to be
the girl but no she was every bit a woman now and a fighting one walked over to adam fry and took hold of his shoulder as she said what do you think i am mr fry
here i have been fretting my life away in the city for over a year and now at the first chance i have had for real sport you say it is too dangerous
you and brother need me
did you know that i can speak seven foreign languages do you realize that i have a flair for languages a real appreciation of sound
i have to go with you donot brother
he has never gone alone have you brother
you would be cruel to force me to stay
now its all settled and i am sure you feel better knowing that i have decided to give up new york society for your company start on those records
i am thrilled with the idea of actually listening to a termite talk especially a giant termite that is millions of years old
bailey bankerville threw up his hands in wellsimulated hopelessness
you see how it is fry
this girl has bossed me ever since she was a walkytalky baby
i guess the only way to get rid of her is to take her with us
i am going to send for your clothes and you will be our guest till we start
i think i will send a long message to the librarian of the congressional library warning him to carefully protect that manuscript
it would be a good idea for him to make a few hundred photostatic copies and distribute them throughout the world
i am going to send for some manufacturers of scientific apparatus and start them to work on those acoustophones that souderman used in listening to the conversation of the termites
i think that it will be a good idea to hire a few expert philologists and one or two entomologists
we need a firstclass staff of scientific workers at least to start with
i feel that the closer we keep our secret the better for us because i do not think it will help any to broadcast our intentions
hells bells
if those white ants can read a telephone directory they may be able to read the newspapers
going to work a man of training to think was to act
he converted several rooms of his house into a workshop and installed over a dozen scientists all of whom were famous in their particular line
the phonograph records were reproduced and several sets sent out to strategic points in the northern part of the world
work was started on the scientific apparatus that was necessary
an improvement was at once made in the sight machine and instead of a few feet of vision obtained by souderman over ten feet were now possible
fry bankerville and susanne worked at fever heat
it seemed as though time were a valuable jewel not to be wasted in any way
not until the third evening was there any relaxation and then for some unaccountable feminine whim miss bankerville dragged the unsuspecting adam fry to the roof garden of the bankerville mansion
it was a beautiful evening a lovely location and a supremely attractive woman
adam was really not to blame if he tried in any way to duplicate the conduct of his namesake of the garden
however such a procedure was far from his thought
for the time being he could think talk and dream of nothing but the termite
the woman realized this
at the same time she was a woman
those termites seem almost devoid of emotion mr fry
they certainly are
of course they may have thoughts that are unknown to us but mainly their life is a cold cruel materialistic one
then there is no love as we know it doubt it
the entomologist escherich was fortunate enough to open a royal apartment and observe it for a few minutes before the alarm was given
he drew a picture of that apartment and its inhabitants which i have been seeing in my sleep it haunts me like a nightmare
souderman had a copy of it and we used to study it
he felt that it was very true to life
he saw the queen a large inert white creature a feminine god created for one purpose only the laying of an egg every second
in a large ring around the outer sides of the room a solid ring of enormous warriors are constantly on guard
a ceaseless line of workers deposit drops of food into the mouth of their motionless sovereign
other workers seize each egg as it drops wash it and carry it away to the nurseries
around the queen small policemen guard her from any possible attack
for five years she lays an egg a second
then her usefulness over she is deprived of food dies of starvation and is like all other dead termites ejiten
susanne shuddered am glad that i am not a termite queen
has she a husband
yes a poor little insignificant thing
he is only a small fraction of her size and spends most of his time hiding underneath her to avoid being eaten by the workers
it is thought that he fertilizes her eggs after she voids them
susanne shuddered again
this gesture drew her closer to adam fry am glad she said that you are not a termite male
and adam fry replied that he was glad that they were just human beings able to look up to the stars and smell the flowers and know what the love of life really was
after a month of hard work the scientific expedition was ready to start to africa
a special steamer had been chartered and loaded with everything necessary to promote success
there were two airplanes and the same number of competent pilots
laboratory workers entomologists linguists and one expert in poisons that might be applicable to the termites if danger presented
probably few expeditions had been so thoroughly equipped in such a short time
it was still summer time and the plans provided for a start on the first of august
a strange attack i was the last of july
the boat was all ready
it was the last night the three conspirators were to spend in the bankerville mansion
the talk that night was not about termites but of the social changes that would take place in the world if the controlling force of the nation could be discovered and influenced for the good of the common people
about ten several terrific explosions were heard and the entire house was rocked on its foundations
earthquake asked fry
earthquake nothing
that was some kind of dynamite or hellsbells
hear those shouts
sounds like a mob
that is a queer thing
first time i knew anyone had it in for me
we will investigate this later on
the thing to do now is to get out and do it quick slip out through the garden and back to the car and beat it to the boat
i smell smoke perhaps they are trying to set fire to the house
here fry take a gun and you susanne take this pair of automatics
thank goodness you know how to use them
now lets beat it
and in the darkness that just preceded the flare that told of the burning of the house they rushed to the automobile and down to the ship
once on board the ship bankerville started to telephone to the various members of the expedition to join him at once
all night he stayed at the phone giving a thousand orders and not once did he make any remark about the attack on the house
before daylight all were on board and orders were given to start down the bay
it was not till the ship was several hundred miles out from new york that he seemed to notice the other members of the party
they unable to help him in his complete absorption of the various problems arising from the sudden leaving had spent part of the night listening to the news that was coming over the radio sun of new york
newspapers were still in existence but many millions of urbanites received all the news of the day over radio newspapers and a part of the equipment of the ship consisted of a radio and television news service
the three bailey bankerville his sister susanne and adam fry gathered in cabin before breakfast
what happened last night sister he asked
enough
an unorganized mob for some reason attacked our house
some members of that mob had dynamite
they blew up part of the house set fire to all of it plundered what they could and badly handled all the servants
three of our people were killed including james the butler
the police were at once notified but by some mistake went to the wrong part of the city
by the time they were on the job the damage was done
the fire department came out but the mob cut the hose lines
there was a terrific riot
it was the belief of the reporters that the three of us were buried under the ruins of the house
apparently our quick getqway fooled them
there the police are at a loss to understand the reason back of the attack
several of the rioters were arrested but could give no explanation for their conduct
they simply said that for some reason they had to do it they saw a crowd running and they ran along
the editorial comment is rather peculiar
there is a good deal of talk about the rich oppressing the poor and the possibility of communism spreading throughout the united states
it appears that there is a suspicion that the fire department and the police were in sympathy with the rioters at least their handling of the entire matter was very inefficient
the police commissioner is going to make a special investigation
he states that for some reason there were hundreds of traffic violations at that time of the night at least ten times more than normal and his men were so busy trying to get things fixed on the streets that he could not handle the riot as well as he might have on other evenings and of course that in itself is peculiar
the president has come out in a guarded statement saying that there has been a great deal of criticism of the government by certain classes of the financial aristocrats and that whenever that happens the lower classes feel privileged to do as they please
it all looks like a mess to me bailey
what do you think about it adam fry asked the banker
well of course i do not know much about the way the common people feel concerning you and your wealth but the suddenness with which this happened the dazed condition of the prisoners their inability to understand what it is all about the coincident traffic difficulty the fact that the police went to the wrong part of the city the cutting of the fire hose and even the statement of the president all seem to me to point to one thing
and what is it that you men think demanded susanne
the two men looked at each other guess we think the same donot we finally asked the banker
have to
what else can we think
well go ahead and say it said the sister rather peevishly
oh simply this finally said fry
the central intelligence of this united states the ego or whatever you call it that we talked about when we compared the life of a nation to the life of a giant termite well that central power wherever and whatever it is grew tired of our independence and original thinking and criticism of his stupidity and inefficiency and he ordered a lot of workers to go and destroy us
losing themselves is just what i think said bankerville emphatically
of course i would not have thought that some months ago but it really is a beautiful demonstration of our hypothesis
no doubt many of those people from the president down thought they were acting on their own initiative whereas in reality they were just obeying orders like the workers or soldiers in a termitary
for some reason we were able to think a trifle faster than the central power
of course if he had known we were in that automobile or here on the boat all night he could easily have gone ahead with the killing
he is capable of a good many things but he is not omnipotent by any means
the three of us are perhaps insulated in some way against his power
we irritate him but he cannot get rid of us
perhaps he feels about us like a human being feels about a beginning cancer
now the question arises as to what his next move is going to be
will he think that we are dead under the burning building
or will he be able to locate us on the ship
if he can perhaps he can command the crew to mutiny and kill us here
he can easily find out where we are heading for as the ships clearance was for cape town
what do you think we had better do susanne believe we had better get lost
what do you mean
can you depend on the crew to be loyal believe so
most of them have been with me before
then send a wireless out to the effect that the ship under orders left new york last night but that the three leaders of the expedition are missing and it is believed that they were killed in the riot
a few hours later send an that the ship is sinking
then send another that the situation is hopeless and the crew has taken to boats
then put the crew to work painting a new name on the ship and changing her generally
slip into some little south american port and bribe the port authorities to give you false clearance papers and just go out on the seven seas as a tramp steamer
no use going to cape town for there are all kinds of reasons that they will be waiting for us there not only the giant termites but the representatives of the central human termite power
no doubt the english and american powers are in sympathy
well they would control australia
certainly but we would not go to any port and even if we did we would not be recognized in our new disguise
maeterlinck says that at cape york australia large groups of termitaries can be seen from shipboard
we have had an exciting twentyfour hours but we must not lose sight of the fact that the main reason for this expedition is to find just what the real ruler of the giant termite really is like
we decided that we had to know that in order to come to any understanding of the same force in the national termite go on and do what we started out to do
your entire plan sounds like common sense susanne said her brother
do you know fry that this little woman is right just about all the time wonder why that is asked fry
that is because i am a woman replied susanne
you know we are right because we use intuition instead of reason in arriving at our decisions
during the next two weeks progamme was carried out to the letter
gold bribed a central american port official
dirty linens unshaved faces completely changed the appearances of the officers and crew
all entered into the spirit of the game and it was hard to tell bankerville from the most villainous seaman
susanne as the cabin boy made a thoroughly hardboiled lad
several times they were stopped by american and english war ships but in every case their general looks and false papers were sufficient to fool the inspecting officers
whenever this happened fry and bankerville would look at each other silently while susanne in her cabin would execute a real horn pipe
hot diggity dog she would exclaim
guess the little girl knew her onions
they are certainly after us but so far we have them fooled
bankerville gives orders they finally came to australia
it took another week of careful sailing to locate cape york
several miles out they were forced to anchor but the termite colonies could easily be seen through glasses
there were hundreds of them rising many feet in the air in every possible shape
after their long trip the crew looked at the peculiar coast line with a great deal of interest
it was dusk and bankerville gave orders that under no circumstances should any one leave the ship for any purpose
then he called a meeting of susanne adam fry and the captain
as they gathered in his cabin he almost shouted well we are here now
the voyage is over
then he started to write on a piece of paper signalling to the three that they should watch him and this is what he wrote believe that our destination is known to the various powers that are determined to destroy us
the only way that we can escape from them is to think faster than they do
i am sure that they can hear the vibration of the voice over great distances and that is how they came near killing us in new york city
i want them to think that we are here and going to stay
in reality we are going to wait till dark and then slip out to sea
to the east of us are the new hebrides
there are thirty islands in this group but only twenty of them are inhabited as the termites are so bad on some of the smaller ones that the inhabitants have despaired of growing anything
one of these uninhabited islands is called whitsunday and that is where we are going
do you understand
the three silently nodded
bankerville silently held the paper in his hand struck a match and burned all he had written
three hours later the tramp steamer raised anchor and slowly steamed eastward
four days later it found a pleasant and safe harbor on the east side of whitsunday island
it was over seven weeks since they had left new york
during the voyage their destination had been changed three times
now they hoped that in this safe harbor of an isolated uninhabited country they could start in their study of the giant termite and the occult power that ruled it
the harbor was so small and yet so deep and landlocked that it was decided to keep on living on the steamer and make regular visits to the termitaries which even from the ship were plainly visible some being eighteen and twenty feet high
some apparatus was sent ashore but as most of it was portable it was thought advisable to carry it back and forth each day
that night bankerville for the first time had a staff meeting of all the scientists
these gentlemen had not been at all idle on the trip but had spent long hours of study some at the extensive library on the termite others learning the language from the phonograph records while the poison expert dabbled in his laboratory concocting new and deadly liquids and gases to use if necessary
as usual bankerville ruled this meeting
he was a natural ruler and while he always consulted fry and his sister still when there was a public meeting of any kind he allowed no doubt as to who was in command of the expedition
gentlemen he said suppose you all are aware of the real purpose of this expedition
we are here to make a complete and thorough study of the giant termite
some of us have peculiar ideas of just where this study will lead us but irrespective of those views i would urge all of you to be true to your scientific education
if your observations fail to show that souderman was right in some of his ideas i want you to say so
for example you may arrive at the conclusion that what souderman thought was a language is simply a coincidental conglomeration of natural sounds proceeding from the termitary and not in anyway connected with mental processes of any kind or form of life
you must remember that souderman led an isolated antisocial life for many years
he thought of nothing saw nothing heard nothing except it was in some way connected with the termite
under these circumstances it is entirely possible that he may have had hallucinations
he made double records but the giant termite talking back to him may have been nothing but the other side of his dual personality
in other words he may have had the split nature the true schizophrenia of the paranoid praecox
in all of your scientific study of the termite remember these things
if one of you make a discovery do not accept it as the truth but see if three or four of your fellows are able to arrive at the same conclusion independently of each other want you also to always bear in mind that we feel there is a possibility that we are here dealing with a personality that is very old and very intelligent
it may be that the things we call the brains of the giant termite are far more intelligent than we are
they had no trouble in killing johanson in africa to keep him from spreading the facts about their dual language
they traced souderman to new york and ate his manuscripts
be on your guard
because they are so small always out of sight do not underestimate their power
because you never saw a thing happen do not think that it cannot happen
they are cunning
they have been known to eat a picture frame and all and at the same time cement the glass to the wall to keep it from falling and waking the people in the room
with such insects the only safe way is to remain constantly alert
there is no telling what they will do next
as the old copy book said eternal vigilance is the price of safety feel that we should finish this work as soon as possible but we do not want to finish it before we are through
by that i mean that we do not want to be forced to leave
the least relaxation of caution the slightest break on our part may be the means of driving us from our work on this island
i want each of you to make as much progress in his speciality as possible but at the same time i want all your work to bear on one problem
has the giant termite a central force or intelligence
if it has is this something like the mind of man simply a higher form of a central nervous system or is it some occult power
whatever it is is it above or below the mentality of the human being
can this central force be understood apprehended by the senses of man by sight hearing touch or is it something in a new dimension that might be thought of but would not be tangible like objects in the three sensual dimensions
this is the problem that has brought mr fry and me to this island and we want to stay here till we have a satisfactory answer to at least a part of the question
finally i want you to recall that we are dodging the influence of some peculiar occult power that has threatened us since that fateful night in new york
so far i think that we have been able to keep one move ahead of that power but at any time these influences may find us
i am going to ask you to be very careful of your own feelings
if you become angry mad at one of your fellow men report the matter at once to either mr fry or myself
it may be that your desire to harm your fellowman is a desire that is put into you by this occult power
there may be even mutiny
please think of this
remember that our success has a large influence on the future hopes of mankind
the next day they started to work
to he continued it was an esplanade two miles long
we were facing southwest a mile high and the view was magnificent
we were above the southern end of central park but new york city was gone manhattan was a wellkept meadow miles wide two miles long and two i miles high is eight cubic miles
eight floors to the hundred feet or four hundred to the mile give three thousand two hundred square miles of floor space
this is as large as an ancient cityforty miles long and twenty wide covered solidly with houses four stories high and no part of it is more than two miles from any other part
obvious answered but not enthusing
you do not click it shrugged my guide
the phrase intrigued me and i stared at him
he was neatly uniformed in dark olivedrab like a hotel bellboy but few bellboys have such a chin and none such eyes of flashing dark intelligence
try it from another slant he said
we have no traffic problem
what is your population asked
about eighty millions
you are not overcrowded sneered
he took me seriously
eight hundred floors he said about a hundred thousand to a floor
that twentyfive thousand to the square mile and forty persons to the acre
we give a thousand square feet of floorspace to each
that is enough
where do you get your light
he flung his hand upward
i thought the passage flooded with sane twentyseven
the room was large about twenty feet by thirty and white
it had a low divan across one end and held two or three easychairs and tables but was on the whole sparsely furnished
the young man waved me to a chair and sat down himself see no windows
how do we get ventilation
i asked
compressed air is released near the floor
it goes out into the passageway through that ornamental steel grating over the door
in summer its expansion cools the rooms
we keep a brisk cool even temperature all the year round
here is the electric heater if you want more warmth the fan if you want a breeze
this is the bathroom door
here is the light switch here is the graph
what is a graph
he looked at me intently thought it universal in the world he said at last even pardon me on farms
do i look like a farmer
not in the least he answered but am an explorer i smiled have been away from your modern cities for a long time
many things in your ultramodern civilization puzzle me
explain as if i were a child
pleased by my confidential tone he answered press this black is briskly
butdaylight but now i saw that the light rose from behind a narrow cornice and was reflected from the white tiles of the ceiling to those of the floor
helium tubes he said exactly the same quality and intensity as sunshine
here is your room
he unlocked a door and set my suitcase inside
i motioned him in after me come from far away said and am behind the times
make sure before you go that i can understand your conveniences
what for instance is the number of my room he answered and handed me a tagged key then translated floor four hundred south section passage fifty room present story is one of the most extra ordinary ones which it has been our good fortune to read in years
it is another one of those that will make history
as you read the story you are not certain whether the author is serious or whether he laughs up his sleeve at the failure of the human race in general particularly when it comes to the big problem of transportation and human conduct in large centers of population
one of the strangest if not the strangest phase of our civilization is found in our city transportation
the automobile which was supposed to save us a great deal of time on account of its speed has been signally defeated in our large cities and even the mediumsized ones
today the automobile as a vehicle to move people speedily has signally defeated itself
due to the very large number of automobiles their effectiveness has been nullified and in our big cities you can walk short distances much quicker than ride
the author of this story must be given credit for having developed a most unusual as well as original idea which is not only original but highly plausible
the city which he plans does away with all traffic problems as we know them today and you are constantly asking yourself the question yes why not
indeed we believe this story to be prophetic because sooner or later some such city as foreseen by this talented author will come about
we only hope that the author unll have some similar treats in store for us in the future ton dictate against this disk and take the printed record from this drawer
press this white button manipulate this dial and speak to any person in the city or ask for central and get any person in the world
reverse the switch and get music or lectures on the first button or any book or play you like on the second

if it is a mechanical mistake like leaving both switches down everything returns to zero automatically
what are the fees for this
included in the rent
excellent
where do i eat
synthetic liquid foods from the dialed icewaterfaucet in the bathroom
they are made automatically in bulk so cheaply that there is no charge for them
busy people live on them for weeks at a time but they lack bulk and vitamines
real meals are served at any restaurant along the passageway
thank you i said will not keep you longer and handed him a quarter
he looked at it long and curiously then spun it away sprang to the graph and began to dial trembling with wrath
room he barked cartex speaking
send police
attempted bribery
i might have tried to soothe him but he fell back into his chair unconscious
i tried to go to him but had just strength enough to stagger to a chair myself
interrogated to find two quiet strangers in the room
the one bending over cartex remarked there was a little too much gas have to wait
his voice was very calm
what is it all about officer
i asked
what did you do countered my own man gently
gave him a tip
we always tip the bellboy where i live i answered
the two policemen eyed each other and i took a long look at them
they had the same prominent chins as cartex and eyes of dark intelligence and were dressed much as he was
they were however agreeably unexcited
what is a tip asked one
money for carrying my suitcase explained the custom still survives in central africa commented the other
do you live there
no though i have been there
i live in new york
cartex man raised his eyebrows and answered this is new york
before i had recovered from this thunderbolt he went on uganda keeps the custom because the blacks there feel themselves inferior to the whites
here there are no such social strata
cartex misunderstood
the insult was too great
where there is no intention to be insulting there is no insult
cartex looks intelligent
he will forgive me
what did i do you assumed that cartex was your social inferior he
certainly not
cartex is a dramatic student working along to a degree
but even so a coin or two from one who has a larger income your incomes are the same
by the way let me see your service card
we need your name age place of origin and data
what is a servicecard
the two men looked at each other again and there was so long a pause that during it cartex woke up
he did it thoroughly and all at once like a kitten
cartex said learn from this man that i was rude to you by offering you money for service rendered
i did not understand
i beg your pardon
he did not mean to bribe you explained my man
there was another pause while cartex visibly controlled himself and considered
at last he smiled
then there was no offense he decided withdraw charges
excellent said my man
come tell the judge
the stranger has no servicecard
where did you find him
walking along this passage with his key in one hand and a suitcase in the other
he asked the way to his room
where is the suitcase snapped the other man
they searched the whole apartment but could not find it
what did you do with it my man demanded at last
nothing i answered
cartex set it just inside the door
i have not seen it since
ruffled by this they took me along a hundred yards of passageway and entered an elevator in silence
how do you manage an elevatorshaft two miles high
i asked cartex
we donot he said
we break the trip every few dozen stories
and ease the pressure on your waterpipes by tanks every few stories also i suppose
i continued
of course agreed cartex
the court had graphs and dictaphones enough and very few spectators but otherwise it was much like my idea of such places formed from the illustrated papers
the judge was a quiet thin cleanshaven courteous man in a black gown more like a highgrade surgeon than a judge
he ordered me seated in a very comfortable metal chair upon a rubber mat under a very powerful arclight then flashed blue lightning at me from under his white eyebrows and asked why i was there
lost in time
i said that there is some informality about what the quiet gentlemen with the heavy shoes call a my young friend cartex also preferred a charge of bribery against me but courteously withdrew it on learning that i had no such design
explain said the judge to cartex cartex did what is your name the judge then asked me
griswold lee answered where were you born
baton rouge louisiana jan
the keen thin tired face of the judge suddenly changed
his interest in me had been professional
now it was personal and vivid
where do you live
brooklyn i said and gave him my address on remsen street
what is your occupation
first soldier then after the war explorer and freelance imaginative writer
the world would not believe my discoveries in thibet when i presented them as facts so i was compelled to dress them up and sell them as fiction
how did you get here do not know judge
twenty minutes ago i was sitting at my desk in brooklyn writing an article
suddenly i found myself walking down a passageway in this hotel with a tagged roomkey in one hand and my suitcase in the other
i looked around for the bellboy who should be with me but found no one
then i met cartex
what was the subject of the article
the probable development of the ultramodern city
the judge looked at me too intently for comfort
then he asked a quiet man in onepiece tan overalls who was sitting at a keyboard watching a plotted curve inspector can you detect a hiatus the man looked up and shook his head
he had so keen and kind a face that i liked him
there is no hiatus he answered
when an impossible statement is made under the veriscope the judge explained speaking with clearcut precision only one course is open to the court to detain the subject for observation by competent alienists
mr delusion that he is in a twentiethcentury hotel is clear
mr lee permit me to compliment your selfcontrol
you have passed through some unknown experience so drastic that it has not only deprived you of your servicecard but has obliterated from your mind all memory of itself and of your personal identity and still you retain mental poise and balance
it gives me great regret that i have no choice except to commit you to a psychopathic hospital for observation upon the charge of inurbanity
i am required by statute to ask if you have any requests to make before this is done
it would be a great pleasure to see your city judge said and cartex who i understand is a dramatic student working through college as a bellboy was kind enough to overlook my involuntary rudeness and withdraw charges thus making himself my friend
if cartex might be assigned to guide me cartex rose to object but the judge spoke first
there is no hiatus he said mr lee accurately states both his opinion and his wishes
it might be of assistance to a diagnosis to act upon them
has doctor gray arrived
here sir nervously answered someone from the door
mr lee went on the judge cartex and doctor gray have long been friends
they will act as your escort
the suspected defect
doctor is inurbanity
you may familiarize yourself with the details of the case from the newspapers
verdict suspended and subject remanded to the care of cartex and dr gray
next case
dr gray came over and spoke to me
he was dressed much like cartex a keen pleasant dapper little man middleaged with a brown beard and hair and eyes
he clipped his words as if in a hurry
when 
cartex joined us the doctor led us out into the passage
there is so much we need to tell each other he began that we had better go where we can talk
where shall that be
the sunparlor is not crowded at this hour suggested cartex
in a cubic city nothing is more than two miles from anything else
the average distance is about half a mile
the doctor was of a methodical as well as a nervous turn of mind for as we strolled along he laid down lines along which we were to talk
i did not fully follow him because a woman and two children in rosesilk knitted bathingsuits and slippers came out of an apartment and sauntered along the passageway in front of us
they made a charming little group not out of place on any seabeach but singular indoors
then suddenly my breath was taken away for the passage debouched on a great esplanade forty feet wide and two miles long roofed floored and walled with glass
roof and floor were translucent so that we could see other levels under and above us
at first this made me dizzy but one soon grew used to it
we had come out about halfway up the wall facing southwest so that we were a mile high and the view was magnificent
we looked across north river and new jersey exactly as one might from an airplane
i had been up in an airplane over new york more than once so that i recognized the terrain
but i recognized nothing else
we were above the southern end of central park but new york city was gone
manhattan island was a wellkept meadow grassed treed and parked
you seem to have received another shock said dr gray
sit down
i explain to myself i look around
the inner half of the glass floor rose a trifle and was filled with steamer chairs and in these chairs basking in the spring sunshine lay quite a number of people in bathing suits while others strolled along the pathway
sunbathers said the doctor
the glass is the cubic city is two miles wide two miles long and two miles high
it has eight hundred floors and is as large as the ancient city forty miles long and twenty wide
its population is eighty million quartz glass and lets in the actinic rays
everyone who can get the time takes a sunbath every day
all doctors prescribe it
the place does not seem crowded i remarked
the population of this floor is a hundred thousand
it has eight miles of glass promenade all exposed to the suns rays every day
it could accommodate a hundred thousand reclining chairs but we find two rows of twenty thousand each enough except on sundays
the sunbathers on week days are mostly women and children
cartex told me you had a thousand square feet of floor space to each citizen
do you not waste too much of it on these sunbaths
about sixteen square feet each
if it took more it would be worth it but cartex referred to space inside the building
these galleries are extra
our board of health finds them indispensable
not only do they cure disease but they form the best possible way to detect it
people in bathing suits cannot conceal much about physical condition from a keeneyed doctor
we catch and cure most things before they are well started
but are not the suits a little er extreme
i asked watching a couple of girls stroll by
we have some regulations shrugged the doctor but as a general thing our policy is to let all do what they like so long as they do not interfere with other people
if those girls were ugly the art department would drop them a hint if they seemed likely to become immoral they would be regulated instantly by child welfare we canot have unauthorized babies if they appeared unhealthy the health department would put them through a clinic but as it is if they like to expose a few more square inches of young complexion than do most nobody cares
i dare say cartex bathing suit is scantier
hush doctor warned cartex laying a finger on his own lip or read the papers
so far as i can understand my case dr gray i said you are to examine me for insanity or inurbanity whatever that is and through the courtesy of the judge you are showing me the city and observing my reactions as the easiest way to make a diagnosis
is there nothing i can do to assist you to a belief that i am sane
tell me just how you got here answered the doctor which i already know from the judge you cannot do can come pretty near it answered although of course only by inference since i remember nothing
doctor have you ever summoned up pictures in your mind
no man discovers anything without doing so
i c dr gray put in cartex is one of our foremost mindspecialists and has even made an improvement in the veriscope itself
although ill from overwork he has assumed the duties of an assistant interne because of the great singularity and interest attaching to your case mr lee
then if he can grasp my oldfashioned technical phrases he may perhaps help me
it has been my habit doctor to picture mentally the scene i was describing
when i made a forecast i concentrated until i saw it
this power has grown with practice until quite recently it has become independently pictorial
i mean that in imagining a scene i do not have consciously to create the details
they fill themselves in often quite accurately
for instance in a recent dispute as to the presence of a large stone in a salmon pool which i had never seen i closed my eyes willed to see the stream from above picked out the pool mentally descended to the bank looked and found the stone there also a pine which nobody had mentioned but which both my companions recalled when reminded
the sensation was exactly that of visiting the place and the results were about the same
my explanation to them was that i read telepathically the picture in their minds
the thing is not clairvoyance because i do not go into a trance
however i have been greatly puzzled lately by unexplained small objects in my room
in one of these scenes i chose to image to myself i picked a violet and later found a newly plucked wild violet in my fingers
i laid it on my desk and turned away and when i looked back it was gone
amused by this i imagined treasurescenes in the past in which i helped myself to gold and jewels
i brought them back with me and watched them fade after an hour or so
i could see no gain in telling another observer
autohypnosis vivid as mine would necessarily be telepathic
whether what i saw were there or not the other observer would see it too and the practical dangers were great
today i photographed several objects just brought back sent the film to be developed then settled down to finish a promised article for jeems on the probable development of cities in the near future
i was intent on the most interesting part when i looked up and found myself here
the suitcase which you handed me was real put in cartex real heavy and utterly ancient
did nothing which you brought back stay
i learn much i my hands into my pockets and produced the usual things notebook billfold penknife cigarette lighter and silver and even copper change
cartex went into ecstasies over each article and pronounced them all genuine antiques of the twentieth century
among the pennies was a gold turkish coin apparently very ancient
where did you get that asked cartex did not know that it was still there
i see no reason at all for you to believe me but i picked that coin in imagination out of the treasurechest of an elizabethan buccaneer
i thought it had vanished like the others
we believe you perfectly mr lee broke in the doctor
we have no doubt at all of your sincerity
we have seen you under the veriscope of course we do not for a moment dream that your perfectly sincere account of yourself is correct but we are searching together with you for the facts
perhaps said it will help if you tell me how this great change in citybuilding came about
at least it will assuage my curiosity
the financial life of a skyscraper was about twenty years answered the doctor although the mere physical life ought to be centuries
they altered quickly
they were made larger and still larger
invention of the helium lamp giving real daylight removed the need for windows
the drift of population to the cities became an avalanche
problems immense and sinister such as the world had never seen before arose and were grappled with one by one and solved all but the problem of lateral urban transportation
how many streetlevels in two answered cartex for me
wilson on transportation says that bridged streetcrossings for pedestrians did not come into general use until and then on main streets only
sidewalks between crossings were not raised until some years later
whatever the dates of separate improvements shrugged dr gray they came too late
the growing population overtook them all and clogged them
yet inside the great buildings which continued to grow larger there was no congestion because there was no need of lateral transportation
everything on any one floor was within easy walk of everything else
men took an elevator to whatever floor they wanted then walked to their destinations
therefore each building tended to be more complete in itself containing everything but sleeping quarters
at last it became economical to add a floor or two and give janitors shopgirls elevator boys repair men and such persons dormitories in the building
the custom grew until half the city was housed in the same buildings in which it worked but since by that time the population had more than doubled this did not ease congestion in the streets
some help was gained by throwing bridges from building to building but these became congested too
bridges were thrown then from every floor of every building and so the cubic city was evolved
the rest was detail
what limits the size of your cube to two miles air pressure
we find a difference in vertical height of two miles about all anyone can stand
approximately the same limit is placed by horizontal distance
a mile and back is about as far as it is practical to walk
how many cubic cities have you in the united states about three hundred in the world
new york is the second largest
what is the largest
london
jerusalem
it is the nearest to the centre of land surface of the globe
when the suez canal became congested past enlargements we blasted channels to the mediterranean and red sea made jordan valley a saltwater inland lake and the safest harbor in the globe and internationalized palestine
the consequent growth in population made a vast cubic city necessary
internationalized certainly
the world is governed by a league of cities
what is the population of the globe
about three billion
since we discovered how to extract synthetic foods from plants we could support a trillion but we judged it best to limit our numbers and improve our quality
we can cure all diseases except some forms of cancer but we can not remove inherited stupidity
cure all diseases
what is your average life then
about a hundred and fifty years
what is your average index of intelligence
for the normal population theta
for all including the subnormals zeta
for new york city kappa do not understand your table of ratings
we divide the mental distance between the greatest genius and the stupidest person whom we are quite sure is sane into twentyfive parts
the average man in the whole world is one third of the way up
cartex rates sigma
sure enough there was a little badge on cartex lapel which i had mistaken at first for a button then for a greek fraternity pin
doctor gray rates tau smiled cartex bowing or did before his illness
he may do better now
and how would you rate me doctor
i asked
above myself except for your delusion answered doctor gray politely
as it is i am afraid that you must be classified as subnormal
cartex gasped
a revelation no he said not that doctor on a side classification perhaps abnormal perhaps but not subnormal
i never saw a case further from inurbanity
still what can one do where there is obsession shrugged the doctor
isolate it insisted cartex
first isolate it then cure it
he turned to me
admitting for the moment griswold lee that your belief is right and that you have come here from two centuries ago by unknown subjective methods how does the situation strike you
you are here now
the fact of your arrival is so plain that the method of it is comparatively unimportant
is it not clear what your decision must be
is not your proper course to apply for a servicecard take up the work for which you are most fitted and become a useful and a loyal citizen dropping into the background even in your own mind the unsolved mystery of how you came
to learn and labor truly to get mine own living and to do my duty in that station of life to which it has pleased god to call me
i misquoted smiling
you are quite right
of course it is
there doctor triumphed cartex
when an obsession can be so easily mentally isolated as that it is no longer dangerous
you seem intensely interested in this stranger objected doctor gray am doctor nodded cartex though not as you imply
he named me as his friend in open court not knowing
i have had admiration all my life from other men and sometimes even affection but never honest friendship
it has grown mutual think the gentleman has two obsessions
think it in silence then shrugged cartex or i shall be your enemy for life
what smiled the doctor sadly is a poor official to do
on the one hand i must brave your displeasure or on the other i must release upon society a man who really on two counts is not urbane
what is this tnurbanity i asked
when people crowded together in cubic cities answered doctor gray we found that it was possible to commit a great many offences for which there was no law
we therefore made laws against such things as hawking and spitting giggling loud laughter talking in raucous voices bad temper and a thousand other like matters
these laws could not be enforced
any good lawyer could clear his client for they are all matters of degree dependent upon manner time and place
yet any one who did not choose to keep them could make all comfort quite impossible for hundreds round him
a few such men and women comparatively a few could have destroyed our rising new civilization
therefore we lumped these things under the head of tnurbanity
people with ists and isms criminals people mentally ill without being quite insane people incurably boorish and stupid people with complexes and phobias people deformed all people in short who bother others too much and will not or cannot change are classed as inurbane
in a safe simple painless way they are made incapable of bearing children and are confined for life in humane institutions outside the city
most of the institutions are almost empty
we have no longer any criminal classes
we have no insane no idiots no crippled or deformed no one with inheritable diseases no drunkards nor drugaddicts and very few extremists of any kind
also no rebels i suppose said and no reformers
plenty of both bowed the doctor
cartex here is a great rebel against dramatic conventions and every new scientific discovery means drastic reforms but every rebellion and reform must be courteous and urbane
how then shall i become urbane asked personal consultations should be private remarked the doctor and reaching over me he raised a lever in a little machine upon a stand beside us which machine i had mistaken for a radio
quite the most urbane thing you have done yet he went on is to give me a good excuse for shutting off the newsservice
i asked
did you not know that there were several million people watching and listening to us flashed cartex
the doctor and i are made for life professionally by the publicity of our association with you
we have become worldfamous
your coming is worldnews am made for life emotionally also beamed dr gray
the lady whom i love must marry me or indeed she wonot said cartex indignantly
she marries for love only
doctor you are inurbane
the doctor started to his feet so angrily that i thought it best to take command
doctor sit down i suggested
even in my poor day anger was inurbane
cartex a bellboy even a student bellboy should not speak so to an eminent physician
what is the secret you two are discussing over my head and under cover of gesturing with my handkerchief i turned the machinelever back on said there were two inhibitions sneered the doctor
nonsense returned cartex
it is the most natural thing in the world
he has not seen another of our women except in a sunbathsuit
you shall not hurt him
no woman now living had ever received or been in a position to receive so great a compliment honest sincere friendship from a real fighting man spoil the situation
cartex you little devil i broke in
you look like a boy talk like a boy act like one but are you a boy
what do you think dimpled cartex facing me
take off your coat said he did so and stood in his trousers and a silk shirt
must i take off my shirt master he asked have a sunbath suit under it
which would you rather do take it off or come here and let me put my arm about you
both decided cartex
cartex protested doctor gray too loudly for politeness be dramatic
inurbane should if i am not flashed cartex from the hollow of my arm
you know i can do anything in reason and be forgiven
griswold lee said the doctor visibly controlling himself cartex is one of our best comedy actresses a darling of the metropolitan stage
she can care nothing for you
she has not known you long enough
she must be trying to attract you to her to share in your enormous publicity
but she has gone too far
she jeopardizes her position
restrain her
she must be acting but to those who love her such action is not comedy
cartex unless you marry me i must report this man inurbane
lee in that far land you think you came from were you married
no doctor
when i came back from the war the girl i was engaged to had married someone else
since then i have been girlshy
great grief such a thing as love at first sight doctor
i donot know whether cartex feels it yet but i do
you darling gasped cartex turning around in my arms and kissing me
you lightolove snarled the doctor only he paraphrased it
then he struck at her
there seemed only one thing to do so i did it
the doctor disappeared under a chair drummed with his feet a little and lay still and sunbathsuited women from a hundred lounges jumped up and screamed
run for it
run gasped cartex
where asked this way
my room
the way seemed to be along a passageway just around a corner and down an elevator
cartex employed the moments pause while waiting for the elevator and stepped into the car dressed just like any other woman who had been sunbathing except that she was barefoot
the elevator girl recognized both of us but did not know anything had happened
cartex led me to a door unlocked it and shut us both in
now she said tell me that you love me
i had but well begun when the graph buzzed
cartex wiggled out of my arms and ran to it
interurban news speaking it said
is this miss cartex
confused reports have come to us that you have been abducted by a maniac
is that you jimmy i thought i knew the voice
turn on your television
i have not been abducted
i am in my rooms just back from sunbathing
mr lee is not a maniac but the wisest man i ever met
he fell in love with me at first sight
he is with me now
i fell in love with him jimmy we want to get married
help us
have you no mercy cartex
you never really loved me you know jimmie
you love news better
get me a license and a minister and i will i will energize my mirror and you may have the pictures
think of the scoop the graph blurred for a moment then came clear and said they tried to cut us off
what did you do to doctor gray cannot prove it jimmy the visional was offbut the poor man was ill
he had a nervecrash and tried to blackmail me into marriage by threatening to declare griswold lee inurbane then called me an insulting name then struck me
griswold hit him on the point of the chin and he was still insensible when we left
energize your mirror bar your door look out for gas and we will do what we can
married came back into my arms but this time she did it slowly gradually superbly million people are watching us she said rqid thousands yet unborn will listen to what we say
are you as important as all that i asked
no but you are
we live so safely in these modern cities that nothing as exciting as this has happened in a decade anywhere
the world and i know that you have come back from two centuries ago whether the city fathers believe it or not
she pressed a button ran a finger down a list dialed the graph a moment and a quiet voice filled the room
latest developments in the griswold case
the two most instantaneous lovers in the world take refuge in miss cartex apartments
miss cartex bargains for a marriage license and with her usual modesty and good sense turns on the visional
surgeons say doctor gray will recover
griswold lee the only professional soldier now in the world does not understand the publicity accorded him
see our illustrated section
you see the whole world is our chaperone remarked cartex and leaned out of my arms to turn off the graph
there came a whir in the wall and a panel fell open
she took out a pneumatic container opened it and displayed a marriage license
the graph whirred again
the reverend dr worden of st james consents to perform your marriage ceremony
hurry before dr gray interferes
all ready jimmie answered cartex
go
there came a sound of distant organ music
it ceased and the mirror at the side of the room was filled with the image of a robed clergyman who married us his deep voice coming out of the graph instead of from his moving lips
neither of us wore a ring so cartex fetched one from her bedroom
the ceremony over the clergyman disappeared and the graph whirred
doctor gray has recovered and sworn out a warrant against griswold lee for attempted murder
accept congratulations on your maariage
keep your door barred cut off your ventilation and have your husband instantly dictate to us a twentyminute account of brooklyn and new york in nineteenthirty distinguishing carefully between what he has heard or read and what he knows of his own knowledge to be correct
if he gives detail enough we can verify from antiquarian records prove his claims and save you
otherwise you will probably both be convicted of inurbanity and attempted murder
jimmy thats brains cheered cartex
two breaths ago i did not see any way out except spend a honeymoon besieged here and end in death
now you have saved us
dictate griswold donot know how to use the graph
then i will relay it
hurry
begin the doorbell buzzed
new york said in my day was immune to noises
upon the street we could often hear each other speak but in the subways we could not hear ourselves think
we grew so used to this few noticed it
there came a heavy knocking on the door
cartex bolted it barred it jammed the overturned kitchen table slantwise under the lock and made a notch in the floor to hold its lower end by ripping up tiles
in castle garden still contained fishes i went on
the metropolitan museum in the last twenty years had sprouted more wings than a cherub
we had learned how to fly
the interferometer had taught us to tell the size of stars both on and off the stage
the word camouflage had not yet come of age
the first tunnel under north river had just been finished the first bridge just begun
drinking was in a state of arrested development
bootleggers had no souls but only spirits
women had dropped their superstitions and ceased to dress for the unseen
entering uninvited anywhere was impolite and was spoken of as crashing
somebody in the passage is trying to crash our metal door now with a beam
cartex since the illmannered persons outside are so afraid of gas would not a bottle of bath ammonia poured on the rug over our ventilator together with some strips of silk and cotton burned in a dish beneath it send them away
try it called cartex and the graph together
she ran into her little kitchenette to get the dish and screamed
i dashed in after her only to plunge into the arms of a small wiry policeman
i smashed him back against another
the third his arms round cartex was doctor gray
if the dumbwaiter had been larger i really do not know what would have happened i suppose they sent up little men because big ones would have stuck in it
even as it was the fight was desperate
i settled dr gray in the first second
he could not guard himself because his hands were full of cartex
then cartex kept out of the way but whenever i was hard pressed she ran in and hit one of the policemen on the head with a chairleg from behind
when they were both unconscious we tied them up and sent all three down the shaft in the dumb waiter one at a time then jammed the waiter crossways cut the wires and stuffed blankets on top of it
by this time some one had a blowtorch against our front door cutting through the metal
we set some more rags of cloth on fire and they ran but returned
i started a description of my own brooklyn room
as i looked around at cartex luxurious nest it was easy to recall and describe my own bachelor discomforts
for several reasons i kept cartex in my arms
the graph before me blurred then cleared again as the door broke in
i tightened my arms around my wife and went on visualizing my own room
then slowly i found myself sitting at my desk in brooklyn with my landlady clinging to me
it would make another story as long as this to tell how i made the dear lady all the necessary explanations going into details scrupulously
so she decided that she had better marry me
we have gone out to live in the country
she is as happy as the day is long except for one small inurbanitya quite unnecessary one for i have now fallen out of touch with the gentlemen in thibet under whose auspices i once studied
they do not approve of matrimony
yet even now she will not permit me to write a story unless she is allowed to act as my amanuensis
the end new science fiction have prevailed upon a number of our outstanding authors to write for us some new science fiction stories
these stories are now available through our new library entitled science fiction series six books have been prepared with the following titles the thought projector by david keller an adventure in venus by michelmore the brain of the planet by lilith lorraine when the sun went out by leslie stone when the moon fell by morrison colladay the girl from mars by jack williamson and miles breuer these books are available at the small price of 10c each

address all communications and make out all checks to park place new york city jl f2 vw tmm the column of soldiers was winding its way across the plain in the direction of the beleaguered fortress
in the center marched the infantry and on either side a column of fanray machines on leverlike legs spread a fan of rays over the soldiers half the population of the planet venus hurled itself across the void of space at our own world believing they were going to find a new home here i was one of the first prisoners they took
as a matter of fact i fell into their hands before one of them had set foot on earth when their first bulb was still feet above it
it was a cloud bank that proved my undoing
we of the airguard had had our warning but were uncertain as to what to expect
the observatories of the rockies alps andes and himalayas had noted the mysterious objects bursting out of the cloud envelope of venus on orbits obviously calculated to bring them within the gravitational influence
there could be no question but that some humanlike intelligence was back of the mystery
the observatories flashed their warnings to the central astronomical board which in turn reported to the supernational commission of the caucasian league in geneva
but the board went astray in its interpretation of the phenomena
its theory was that the several thousand hurtling bulbs or spheres photographed by the observatories were projectiles containing explosives or some other agency of destruction
actually they housed from to men of venus apiece fleeing their planet
they were trying to escape annihilation by volcanic forces that had gotten out of control after several centuries of increasingly ambitious use
about half the population of venus lacked the courage to face the terrors of interplanetary space in a desperate gamble for continued existence
presumably they perished in the doomsday which followed and which was visible to our observatories as terrific disturbances and upheavals in the venusian cloud envelope
of the other half who exchanged their few remaining weeks of existence on venus for the desperate chance of hitting a pinpoint in space and finding it habitable after hitting it relatively few reached the earth
had a majority done so i question whether we could have withstood them so successfully with their terrible weapons
we would have overwhelmed them by sheer numbers in any event of course but men would have died by the hundreds of millions and the rest of us would have returned to the dark ages if we had not been able to overcome them before they deranged that delicate balance of production commerce finance and social structure that we call civilization
from what i learned as a prisoner our astronomers actually discovered only fifteen or twenty percent of the total number of bulbs launched
altogether more than of them were hurled toward the earth carrying about venusians
the total population of their planet being only slightly over only of these bulbs with crews aggregating actually reached earth
thousands of them were shattered by collisions with meteoric bodies
thousands more were deflected from their course by unforeseen gravitational influences exerted on them and they hurtled on into space past the earth
still other thousands were estimated by the invaders themselves to have missed the target through errors in calculation and the imperfection of hurriedly constructed space guns
but to begin at the beginning i was patrolling the air lanes above northern mexico about a hundred miles south of the texas line with tubby baines handling the radio and telescopes while eggy morris sat at the guns of out this was then the newest type of plane in the air guard a ship of remarkable balance and steadiness for those days with an easily sustainable speed of miles an hour and a cruising radius of miles
as far as the eye could reach and the scopes too for that matter the air was filled with patrol ships each circling the territory of its beat and waiting for we knew not exactly what
the bulbs were due to arrive at any time now
from one end of the continent to the other and throughout europe the supernational red cross division had been mobilizing relief organizations
city populations had been is the versatile author of arrmg geddon and the air lords of han with a brand new thrilling story
there are those authors whose chief claim to our attention is their imagination and those who in addition are inventors of no mean degree
the present author is a combination of both and in addition he knows how to create action stories that are difficult to match anywhere
mr phillips has a knack of inventing new instruments that are as new to literature as they are to science and there is no denying that his scientific creations are plausible and will be duplicated when the various arts have caught up with his scientific prognostic cations
it is always most interesting to us to speculate on what would happen if some alien intelligence from another world granting that it exists would invade this planet
many authors have tried their hand at such a theme but few are as forceful and versatile in picturing such a conflict as is the present author
in addition to this he shows convincingly the importance of terrestrial conditions as they will be experienced by alien invaders ordered to scatter temporarily into the open
it would not do to have one of these bulbs hit closely massed millions if they were explosive
our orders in the air guard were indefinite
we were to patrol watch report and stand by for further orders
we were to spot any hits of the interplanetary projectiles so that relief might be rushed to points needed with the least delay
we were all at a pretty high tension
far above us to the south was a big cloud bank and it was in the middle of the afternoon that tubby sang out to me the general order he had just picked up
all randalls were to rise out of position and head south a hundred miles at whatever level was necessary to carry us above the cloud blanket
observations it seems indicated that most of the oncoming bulbs were falling toward the tropics
i nosed upward in a long easy slant that took us into the cloud bank
once in it we could not see forty feet ahead but i kept the randall rising at full throttle for i knew there would be no other plane within miles at this level
captured tell just how it all happened it took place so rapidly but i was conscious that our plane was entangled in a vast mass of billowing canvaslike material
it closed around us in overwhelming folds as we buried ourselves in it and brought up with a sickening lurch face bore an expression of ludicrous surprise as he spreadeagled over my shoulder sailed over the rail and disappeared scratching desperately for a handhold as he slid down a trough in the billowing fabric
that was the last i ever saw of him
i have no recollection at all of what happened to eggy
i never saw him again
for a moment i clung to the rail as the randall slowly turned over
then i lost my hold and slid with increasing momentum down one of the folds of that vast enveloping fabric a human insect lost in a chaos of drifting canvas feet above the earth
my hand touched a rope
i held desperately to it and found it with my other hand
a short distance below me in the fog i heard a crash evidently the randall colliding with something bulky and metallic
then silence
gradually the sea of canvas straightened out
i knew then that i was clinging to the edge of a vast parachute
but my whole mind was centered on selfpreservation
i had no time to wonder
i went down the rope hand under hand until below me in the mist loomed a section of a great metal dome
with my feet planted on this more substantial support i paused to regain my breath and gather myself together
it did not yet occur to me that i had found one of the interplanetary bulbs
like everyone else i had it set in my mind that these would turn out to be explosive projectiles
moreover i was completely dazed with the suddenness of it all
mistily the metal dome curved downward in one direction
in the other i saw a railing a few feet away
i threw myself toward it and climbed over with a sigh of relief
the whole structure was swaying sluggishly and was sinking i was sure
but it had not fallen below the cloud as yet
then a hatch nearby flipped open
three men climbed hastily out
they were clad in what looked like divers suits covering them from shoulder to foot and over their heads were large goggled helmets
my surprise evidently was equalled by their own for they paused to survey me amazedly through their big goggles
then one of them signalled the others and all three of them leaped upon me like wildcats
taken utterly by surprise i went down under their rush
i was hustled down through the hatch which clanged over my head and literally rushed down a corridor into a compartment that looked like a combination of control room and engineroom on one of our own big dirigibles
the ship for now i knew i was aboard some sort of strange aircraft was crowded
my captors had to fight their way down the corridor with me
some of the crew through whom they pushed were clothed in divers suits and goggled helmets like themselves
others wore sleeveless belted tunics that reached the knees and they looked to me as though they had emerged from flour barrels
their skins were dead white as white as grecian statues
but their eyes were yellow and their close cropped hair a tawny orange
in the center of the control room was a big instrument table at which a marblewhite man sat surrounded by illuminated screens upon which appeared shifting pictures
occasionally he would reach over and twist a lever or flip a switch
my captors stood respectfully waiting for his attention
finally he looked up and stared at me with piercing yellow eyes that looked out from a finely chiselled face that might indeed have been marble from its total lack of color
but he had little time for me then
he waved his hand and turned back to his instruments
my captors hustled me off to a little compartment where i was locked in
later came a slight jar
the ship had come to rest on the ground
there was a clanging of doors and rushing of feet babel of voices and harsh commands and the sound of heavy machinery being hauled around
my captors reappeared and literally dragged me down a spiral companionway to the lower decks of the ship and thence into the bright light of day
squat guns cough i around in amazement
i had emerged from a great metal sphere about feet in diameter
around me was the greatest activity
some fifteen hundred helmeted figures had spread out over the plain
split up into disciplined groups they were busily setting up what appeared to be numerous searchlights and squat broadmouthed antiaircraft guns of complicated design
in the sky above gathered a host of planes of oun air guard circling around puzzled by what they saw below
had they only dropped their bombs then much bloodshed among our own people could have been avoided but quite naturally in this day of civilization they did no such thing
they had reported to washington and had received orders to make friendly overtures to the strange newcomers
one of the planes dropped below the formation and began to spiral down
a few feet away from me one of the squat guns coughed
a blinding flash appeared some fifty feet away from the circling plane which was irresistibly sucked into it
there was a miniature thunderclap and the twisted incandescent wreckage of the plane dropped like a stone
another gun coughed hollowly and another blinding glare of light appeared this time in the middle of the formation above
it sucked in three planes and their broken twisted remains also plunged earthward
then our planes dived their motors roaring
there was a sudden consternation among the whiteskinned men around me
guns coughed frantically
hastily aimed bombs flashed blinding even when seen against the bright sky
two more planes collapsed but the rest dived on
more guns coughed
the attention of my guards diverted for the moment i hurled myself headlong toward the nearest gun whose crew was about to discharge it
i caught the feet of the creature whose hand was reaching out toward the firing mechanism upset him and rolled instantly to my feet tugging at the automatic in the holster on my thigh
i got it out in time to fire point blank at another who leaped at me
he reeled and i noticed as he went down that though the skins of these strange people were white their blood was red enough
i took toll of seven before they finally pinned me down and my little diversion at least kept one of their guns out of action while the planes sprayed the groups of soldiers with a leaden hail cutting them down by the score
then the planes zoomed again to comparative safety
by now however the invaders machines that looked like searchlights got into action
they spread fanlike beams of iridescence overhead
these beams the operators quickly wove into an interlocking network making virtually a continuous cone of pulsing light its base the circle on which the machines had been set up and its apex about a thousand feet in the air
the planes of the air guard returned to the attack this time dropping bombs as they passed overhead
i broke into a cold sweat
i knew the power of those bombs and figured my life in terms of split seconds
then an amazing thing happened
the downrushing bombs bounced off the conecurtain of light as though from an invisible rubber wall and exploded harmlessly
not even the fragments showered around for these too bounced off in their turn
but the invaders were close to panic from the earsplitting force of the explosions and they manipulated their coughing guns in very ragged fashion
through the uproar their leaders rushed about angrily beating them back to the posts they had abandoned
i saw more than one of them strike down a man with his short heavy sword
not until the air guard planes had expended all their ammunition did they withdraw to the foot level where again they circled watchfully
altogether seven planes of the air guard had been shot down
about three hundred of the men of venus lay killed and wounded within the circle
all these casualties however had been suffered prior to the formation of the protecting lights cone which had thrown off bombs and bullets alike rendering the second attack of our planes quite futile although seemingly terrific
ultimatum
i activity on the part of the invaders followed the withdrawal of the air guard squadron
a vast mass of machinery was removed from the sphere which actually was taken apart in the process
its plates and beams had been cleverly designed as interchangeable parts of other machines and constructive apparatus
quickly interchangeable at that
i donot think it took more than an hour or so for the thousand men of venus who were not casualties or assigned to the task of ministering to the wounded to completely demolish the great bulb in which they had arrived on earth
in its place there arose giant cranes and complicated machines which began to dig and handle materials in huge masses with uncanny skill and accuracy
in the center of the circle was erected a cylindrical apparatus which proved to be a boring machine
by some complicated process that was beyond my comprehension it began to dig a great well the displaced earth literally flowing from openings in the side of the thing
as the mound of earth grew around it the cylinder automatically rose in the center of this mound
other machines which squatted like huge metallic insects occasionally raising themselves on leglike levers to change their positions reached out with great extension arms that terminated in universaljointed paddles or hands each probably fifteen feet across and scooped vast quantities of the earth toward the outer part of the mound
before long the removed earth assumed the proportions of a hill
the circular battery of fanray machines was moved outward the number of machines being augmented by constantly assembled additions
then i noticed that the character of the earth flowing from the boring machine was changing
in a few minutes molten lava was pouring out of the broadlipped spouts
there ensued unusual activityon the part of the shovelhanded machines whose operators with a skill that held me enthralled manipulated the liquid stone absorbing the heat from it with accessory apparatus and shaping it as it hardened
night fell and the glow of the lava lighted the scene weirdly tinting the dead white bodies of the invaders
by now they were mostly stripped
with the setting of the sun they had begun to remove their protective diverlike suits and goggled helmets and for the most part were clad only in fullcut short trousers not unlike kilts that extended in pleats from highly ornamented broad belts to a point several inches above the knee
there were many women among them
in fact about a third of them were women but there was no distinction between their dress or lack of it and that of the men
both men and women wore their tawny yellow hair close cropped
nor did there seem to be any division of labor among them that was based on sex
all were working under high pressure at various machines except the executives those who were tending the wounded and the three guards who never let me get beyond their reach
they permitted me free movement however within the confines of the circle so long as i did not approach any of the machines too closely or get in the way of the bustling parties
that more would be heard from our planes that night i know well
the traditions of the air guard particularly the american division did not embrace much consideration of the principle of watchful waiting
i had just looked at my watch it was nine oclock when something white a little weighted parachute floated down right through the cone of the fan rays which spread a faint iridescence through the air above us
a whitebodied girl approached it hesitatingly inspected it where it lay and at last reassured picked it up and ran with it to the commander
i knew what it was a note an ultimatum offering truce or war to the invaders
when the commander looked casually at it handed it back and with a word waved the girl away i had a pretty good idea of what would follow
the air guard would be watching through their night scopes and probably would get a good view of his action for he was standing well in the open and in the glow of the lava
a moan from above swelled into a roar
my heart skipped a beat
it was one of those twoton inflammite bombs
the bombs dropped previously were as pills by comparison
that it would burst through that inverse magnetic film of the fan rays by sheer momentum i had no doubt
but it didnot
with a horrible whooping shriek it rebounded to one side and detonated two or three hundred feet away the shriek and the stunning detonation blending in a vast earsplitting sound
the fanray film threw off the big steel can and its fragments but it offered no resistance to the force of the explosion
the people of venus nearest that side of the circle were literally blown from their feet and lay mangled and bleeding
there followed a period of silence no less stunning than the explosion
then the invaders leaped to work
under snarling barking commands of their leaders they rushed to replace several of the fanray machines that had been blown from their mounts while the operators of the remainder raised the angles of their beams to make the cone as large as possible
fluttering and swinging jiown through the film came another little parachute message
their commander did not have to know any earth language to grasp its meaning
but he did not seem to
or if he did no other course than ignoring it entered into his calculations
again he waved aside the bearer of the message angrily
the invaders once more were near panic but their discipline held
suits and helmets were donned hastily
the coughing guns were manned and began to hurl their queer suction bombs upward into the black night
these projectiles i noticed passed freely through the fanray film
hell from heaven a the circle machines were hastily manned to drive diagonal wells into the ground
in these the ray machines were placed for safety
the work that was accomplished in the next ten minutes was astounding
the men of venus were almost ready for the heavy bombardment when it broke and their suction bombs were flashing with blinding rapidity against the dark sky above
i could well imagine that our air guard were having no picnic with them
their flashing would have served to half blind a pilot
then hell dropped from heaven
one by one at intervals of less than a second the twoton bombs fell
they were thrown off at various angles from the cone film but being set for contact detonation did not rebound to great distances
i threw myself to the ground with my arms wrapped around my head and lay there half stunned
i lost consciousness at the expiration of a short interval
i donot know how long it was before i came to
but as i staggered to my feet those about me were doing the same
there was no indication of our planes overhead and the faint iridescence of the cone film was unbroken
many of the machines sprawled about overturned and wrecked
and at several spots within the circle i could see parts of our planes which evidently had been wrecked by the coughing guns
fully half the original fifteen hundred invaders were now casualties
but the remainder tirelessly took up the task of repairing the damage and carrying on their construction work
and such wonders did they accomplish with their strange machinery that dawn rose on a terraced castlelike structure of solid and cooled lava circular about a thousand feet across and rising to a squat tower in the center the top of which was some two hundred feet above the level of the plain
an encircling ring of fanray machines buried deeply in a diagonallycut trench spread their coneshaped faintly visible protection above the structure and far enough away from it to render the explosion even of such bombs as had been hurled during the night relatively harmless
i was dragged within this fortress and locked in a bare cell from which i had a restricted view through a narrow porthole facing the north
within my range of vision a few sentries covered from head to foot in their peculiar suits patrolled the terraces pausing now and again to gaze through instruments that looked like complicated reflex telescopes mounted on tripods
but the main body must have been within the walls sleeping off their exhaustion for aside from the sentries i saw no one
exhausted myself i dropped to the hard floor and fell asleep
unearthly colonies a deal of history was made in the two months i was held prisoner
but i learned little until afterward of the manner in which the invaders who had peppered the world with colonies similar to the one in which i was incarcerated finally consolidated their strength in the tropical sections of central and south america
most of their bulbs had descended about a thousand miles north or south of the equator
several had landed in the united states
some of these had been overwhelmed at once when their crews showed fight and before they could assemble and bring into action their fanray machines or their coughing guns and suction bombs
others had managed for several days to stave off the airguard and landguard cordons which closed around them
one had held out as long as two weeks
once their fan rays were in operation they were most difficult to subdue
in each case where the airguard did not succeed in annihilating themi at the outset with inflammite pills they finally had to be overpowered by massed infantry attacks
in these attacks our guard suffered tremendous losses for as they passed through the fanray zones their rifles and side arms were wrenched from their grasp by the repelling effect of the inverse magnetic forces
the men were forced to cast aside all equipment containing metal of any description and to meet the soldiers of venus with bare hands rocks and such hastily improvised clubs as they could get a hold of as they advanced whereas the planetary invaders already safe behind their magnetic film were not handicapped in the use of metal weapons and their deadly vacuum grenades
the european divisions of the caucasian federation were not on the whole so successful as the american in coping with the invaders while in asia and other parts of the world the invaders had things pretty much their own way
later as they assembled their aircraft and got their earthly bearings better they abandoned their outlying lava forts and mobilized in the tropical regions of the western hemisphere where the weather conditions were more suited to them and where they achieved such concentration of forces that the most powerful of the hastily organized attacks of the american air guard reinforced from europe were decisively repulsed
then ensued that lull in hostilities that preceded the final conflict
but all this is a matter of general history whereas this account is primarily concerned with my own experiences
skins like fish first week of my incarceration was rather dull
my jailer was a middle aged man of abnormal cerebral development
most of the food he brought me turned my stomach filthy messes of partially decomposed animal and vegetable matter
there were certain vital physiological differences between the men of venus and those of earth and as a matter of fact the fare that was brought me was in full conformity with their standards of wholesomeness and palatability
my jailer pestered me continuously forcing me to utter the names of everything he could point but to me or show me pictures of
they had some very clever photographic process that enabled them to take telescopic pictures of great clarity and accuracy
from the names of objects he probed me for words denoting action and so on until much to my surprise at the end of no less than a month he addressed me one day in halting but unmistakable english
your speech has been very hard to learn he informed me because it is so involved and much less direct than ours though it has the advantage that you have fewer words to remember
this was the gist of his speech
i donot remember the exact words he used except that they were very funny and also very ingenious in the association of ideas through which he made his meaning clear
but after this he did not bring my food any more
instead a young girl was assigned to the task
she informed me haltingly that she was learning my speech
let me teach you i suggested
she smiled at this but shook her head negatively can learn more quickly from the miorurlia she said
and at the end of another week she was speaking better english than the man had
she told me i was considered something of a prize for though their colonies had captured several thousand earth men most of them had rated low in intelligence and they had only two or three altogether who spoke english
her name she said was nyimeurnior
she quizzed me untiringly about life on the earth and since her questions covered the entire range of engineering medicine sociology history commerce and dustry as well as political economy i was rather hard put to give satisfactory answers
but in turn she freely discussed her own race with me
she found it difficult to understand why the food they had been giving me was nauseating to me and this led to a long discussion of many physiological differences between earth men and the men of venus
that there were such differences i was not unprepared to learn since there were such differences in physical appearance
on the whole the invaders were a trifle smaller of stature and bigger of head than ourselves
their foreheads were higher their eyes a bit larger and their noses mouths and chins though regular and beautifully molded a bit smaller in proportion
at that however i have seen earth men who could have passed for these people were it not for the difference of coloring
they were as dead white as marble statues except for tawny yellow eyes and hair
and i might mention that they had no hair anywhere upon their bodies except upon their heads where it grew thickly
both men and women wore it cropped very short
this dead white skin of theirs was thicker than ours but was also very soft and normally should have been moist not from perspiration but from the absorption of moisture from the air
this absorption rather than excretion appeared to be the principal function of their pores
they could of course and actually did drink a great deal of water during their life on earth but the sensation was very unpleasant to them and they drank only of necessity because their pores could not absorb from the relatively dry atmosphere of the earth the amount of water they needed
rule or ruin needed considerably more heat also than our climate furnished anywhere except in the tropics
this was the reason for their decision to withdraw those colonies which like the one in which i was held prisoner were located in more temperate regions
it was also the reason why they contemplated no immediate conquest of the earth but planned to remain on the defensive in their tropic strongholds until such time as they might better adapt themselves to earthly conditions and increase their numbers
in the meantime however it was their intention
nyimeurnior told me to keep the earth men busy with destructive air raids
they had anticipated finding the atmosphere different from their own of course and knowing that it would be considerably drier had equipped themselves with waterproof suits which covered them from head to foot
these suits served the purpose of humidors
they were also an absolute essential as a protection from the earthly daylight
our atmosphere lacking the fog filters of that of venus lets through certain rays of the sun which though almost a necessity of life to earth beings are rank poison to venus animal and plant life
does the sunlight never break through the cloud layers of venus
i asked nyimeurnior
not ever she replied quaintly
our daylight is very bright and very warm because venus is so much closer to the sun than earth
but the air is very full of water like the fog you tell me you have in other parts of earth and like these clouds that sometimes pass above us here and it is never you are able to see for greater distances than what you call a quarter of a mile
before we came to earth we knew sunlight only from sending what do you say scientific expeditions up through the clouds many many that is a very great distance
exposure to sunlight even for a very short time was deadly to the people of venus
i had occasion to observe this for myself later
it did not bum them in the way that overexposure does earth men for they had no pigmentation in their skins whatever
but it did pull the blood right out through the pores so that after a time they became horrible spectacles
but even more deadly than this was its toxic effect upon them
it deranged their nervous systems and stimulated them to a hysterical fever which was quickly followed by a torpor and if relief measures were not applied promptly by death
a half an hour unprotected from the rays of the sun would turn the hardiest man of venus into a driedout bloodcaked corpse
an hour or two hours in normal daylight out of the direct rays of the sun would do the same though they suffered little discomfort in going abroad when it was storming or the skies were heavily overcast
naturally they were not happy in the earth atmosphere
nyimeurnior told me that they wore very little clothing on venus and hated the feel of the humidor suits they were forced to wear out of doors in the daytime on earth
but there was no help for that
they simply kept under cover all they could during the day in their artificially humidified structures adopting a schedule of night work
but even at this the chill of the night outdoors was playing havoc with the health of the community and before many more days she informed me they would abandon the lava fort and migrate in the airships they had built since my incarceration to the city which other communities were even now completing in the fastnesses of the tropical forests of brazil cannot understand nyimeurnior i said one day why your people refused all overtures of peace
our earth nations are not bloodthirsty
we do not kill for the sake of killing
there have been many wars in the past owing to the fact that men cannot always agree on everything but in the main earth men live at peace with one another and i know they would be willing to live at peace with your people if you would show the right spirit
there is much in which we could help you much that we could teach you as there is much that we could learn from you
it would be to the mutual advantage of both races
the girl looked at me queerly
her pretty little mouth closed in a grim line
she made no reply whatever but arose and left my cell immediately evidently in anger
i never thoroughly understood this attitude on their part nor have i ever heard that any one else ever did
during the time i was prisoner i tried to suggest the idea of a truce to their leaders as frequently as i could
but it seemed as though their consciousness was utterly and mysteriously barred to its consideration
the only reply i ever got was a blow in the face or a look betokening a suspicion that i was mentally unbalanced ask me why
i canot explain it
but certain it is that from the day the first bulb fell into our atmosphere until that final day when our armies millions strong surged irresistibly through the brazilian forests not once did they make an overture of peace or indicate that they would accept any mercy from us
they simply could not grasp the idea that was all
for several days after i made this suggestion to nyimeurnior she would not speak to me
she brought my food healthful earth food now not the sickly messes they had given me at first and left as quickly as possible
it was as though i had offered her some gross personal insult that had filled her with a loathing of me
mushroom ships didnot bother me much however
to those who had any personal contact with the invaders i donot have to explain why
but for the benefit of those who never saw one at close range i might say that though i found the girl interesting and though i could even go so far as to refer to her as pretty anything like a romantic interest in her was an utter impossibility
imagine if you can being in love with a girl with a deadwhite moist clammy skin like the belly of a scaleless fish bloodless lips and smoky yellow eyes that somehow reminded you of those of a cat although the shape of the eyelids was human enough
no attitude did not disturb my emotions in the least though it piqued my curiosity greatly
gradually however she appeared to forget the insult
her interest in information about the earth served to renew our conversations
perhaps she was ordered to resume them
she told me about their airships mushroomlike affairs in which the space for the crew and cargo corresponded with the stem and the elevating machinery is built into the umbrellalike superstructure
they could rise in a straight vertical line like helicopters move slowly and gently or hover motionless
speedy aircraft she explained would be suicidal in the fogs of venus
i was amazed at her description of the manner in which they were supported
air on the upper surface of the umbrella was destroyed by electronic action thus forming an upsucking vacuum
it was recreated electronically on the under surface of the umbrella thus forming a supporting cushion of compressed air which though constantly dissipating was being replenished with equal rapidity
it was only necessary to vary the speed of the process to rise or fall
automatic compensators constantly adjusted the vacuum and pressure at various points on the umbrella surface always keeping the ship in perfect balance
if anything went wrong with the electronic apparatus the ship merely cme down like an ordinary parachute
horizontal propellers furnished motive power
with the clear air of earth through which to fly she said their engineers were increasing the ratio of motive power and her own community had succeeded in obtaining a speed of miles an hour with its ships
this was less than half the speed of our air guard patrol planes and less than threequarters that of our bombers
we are saving you to teach us about planes nyimeurnior said
saving me from what
i asked
she looked at me in surprise
from death of course she replied
why should we be wasting food and trouble on you if we could not make use of you
would you not spare my life from motives of mercy
i asked
mercy she repeated questioningly in her peculiar pronunciation that is a word we have not spoken of before
what does it mean
i tried to explain to her but quite unsuccessfully
the best she could make of the idea of sparing an enemy of whom no profitable use could be made was that it was a manifestation of ignorance or insanity
i began to realize that these people had no conception of charity sympathy or kindness as spontaneous emotions although they approximated the practical manifestations of the emotions from a motivation of expediency
i delved further and found that they were unfamiliar with love except as an intellectually selfish emotion
a husband was kind to his wife for instance because he needed her help and cooperation and realized that she could give this more efficiently under the influence of consideration and comforts than with a mind or body deranged by harsh treatment
if she lost her usefulness to him he put her away on a sort of pension arrangement
he did not kill her because that would make other women fear him and he might have difficulty in getting another wife
on the other hand a wife was helpful and considerate of her husband because she realized it was to her interest to cooperate fully with him
and naturally the most kind and considerate of the young men and young women were in the greatest demand as husbands and wives
but back of all their courtesy and consideration was nothing but an acutely developed self interest tied up with a peculiarly keen appreciation of the values of cooperation and an ability to weigh and balance those values undisturbed by emotion far in advance of any similar ability on the part of earth men
they had only one true emotion physical fear
they were very susceptible to it
as compensation they had a high order of intellectual courage
the fact that they had risked a journey through space attested that
but their physical susceptibility to fear in moments of emergency was a far greater handicap to their balance and judgment than is the case with the average of earth men
fear tended to paralyze rather than stimulate them to action
intellectually they steeled themselves from early childhood against this weekness but with only partial success
it was quite plain to me as a result of this partial insight into their psychology gained from nyimeurnior that i had my choice of ultimate death or playing traitor to my country my world and my fellow man by teaching them to make and fly airplanes
for strange as it may seem at first thought earth men despite the comparative newness of their mechanical civilization held an advantage in the air from a military point of view with their swift darting planes though it may be conceded that for general convenience and comfort the venus umbrella ship was superior
having developed their navigation of the air along totally different lines for centuries the newcomers had nothing more than an elementary grasp of the principles underlying the construction and use of planes
the judgment of the nyapacleur i no intention however of either turning traitor or sacrificing my life
so i began to maneuver for a chance at freedom
not long after i had come to this conclusion i was take before the nyapacleur or commander of the community whose position with allowance made for the highly organized and mechanically perfected civilization of venus was not unlike that of a feudal baron
that is to say he held the power of life and death over the entire community
the members according to the venus theory owed all their necessities and comforts as well as their very lives to the skill and strength of his leadership
they in turn owed those lives to him if ever he should choose to call for them
this name was lourmon
he was the same before whom i had been taken for a brief instant in the sphere which had brought the community from venus
nyimeurnior and my first jailer whose name i learned was founyi acted as interpreters
the room in which he gave me audience was not unlike an office
he sat at a kind of desk on which however the usual mass of papers was replaced by a number of mechanical contrivances which i judged were various forms of recording and reporting devices
the air in the room was warm and highly humid
lourmon naked except for the peculiar belt and shorts the invaders wore and a kind of sandal was such an incongruous figure from my earthly point of view that i could not help smiling
imagine if you can a near grecian statue come to life and leaning carelessly over a table piled with modern scientific instruments
he glanced at me keenly and spoke a few words in that soft slurring tongue of theirs which was a form of language which no race on earth has yet developed except for purposes of writing
by that i mean that it was not the original or natural speech of these people but a species of shorthand through which entire sentences and paragraphs might be summed up in a single word or two or three words
one of my great regrets is that i had so little opportunity to learn it
these few words founyi translated into nearly five minutes of his slow english reviewing in detail the account of my capture referring more briefly to the journey of the invaders through space and the reasons which led them to attempt it outlining their determination and confidence in their ability to exterminate earth men and take over the world for themselves and setting forth my individual helplessness and the wisdom of endeavoring to make myself a useful slave if i desired to preserve my life
while founyi was translating lourmon clearly impatient at the handicaps of such a slow and clumsy language was abstractedly manipulating the levers of a little apparatus which was presenting to him a series of pictures on a little translucent screen
at the end of speech he looked questioningly at me as though taking my consent for granted
i had decided to appear to agree for only in such a source could i see any possibility of being permitted enough freedom of movement to plan for my escape
but i did not want to seem to give in too readily
it would be more convincing i thought if i were persuaded only reluctantly after more elaborate threats and promises
in this however i made a blunder
lourmon leaped to his feet in a rage when i did not instantly agree
he fairly snarled the word at me
he says nyimeurnior explained calmly that you are a fool but that since you are only an earth man he will give you one more chance to think it over and make better use of what little intelligence you have
he does this not from any motive of mercy or justice to you for as a prisoner you are not entitled to any rights or claims whatever but on the contrary are indebted to him already for several weeks existence
he does it merely because he needs information you can give him and he is willing to sacrifice even his dignity on the chance that you will ultimately give it to him freely
but this sacrifice of dignity in not ordering your execution immediately he will hold against you as a debt
if you do not change your mind you will be torf tured and the secrets of the earth airplanes dragged from yott
i was so amazed at the volume of meaning the girl translated from the single word that i forgot to play my role and instead of consenting at once stood there with an open mouth like the fool lourmon had called me trying to figure out how much language actually had been packed into two syllables and how much was so to speak embroidery added to it by the girl from her knowledge of the situation
lourmon made a vicious little gesture and my two interpreters led me back to my cell not such a low mentality as he believes you the girl remarked
unless i too have misjudged you you will accept
if you decide to before the next mealtime just knock on the panel
the guard outside will be instructed to take you to lourmon who will not need any speech from you but just a sign of assent
with that she stepped from my cell to the corridor and shot the panel across
escape arrangement i thought would give me my opportunity
i glanced through the tiny window of my cell
a brilliant morning sun flooded the half mile or so of bare plain and the rugged rocky country beyond
why should i wait to build up little by little any elaborate plan of gaining more and more freedom of movement within the castle until finally i could make an opportunity of escape it would be better to risk all on a bold stroke
after the first day the sentries had given up patrolling the open terraces in the daytime even in their cleverly constructed humidor suits
two of them had died from it
instead i had been informed by nyimeurnior they were safely ensconced in little turrets which they could enter only from within the fortress and from these they scanned the sky with their telescopic instruments carefully shielded with ray filters for signs of the earth mens airplanes turning their attention occasionally to the rough country surrounding the little plain on which the fortress was located
once i got clear in the open sunlight the invaders would certainly find it difficult to pursue me
my danger would be chiefly that they might launch an umbrella ship after me
indecision is not a frequent fault among us of the air guard
i rapped on the door at once hoping that my guard would be a big fellow for his race and be wearing his humidor suit
footsteps approached and the panel swung back
he thrust his head in the cell and beckoned me to follow him
i seized and jerked him into the room
it would have been easy to knock him out with a blow on the jaw if it had not been for his helmet
but i finally managed to knock this off as we scuffled and then a few well directed blows put him out
i stripped the fellow of his humidor suit
luck was with me for though he was not as large as his suit was a bit large for him and with some difficulty i was able to squeeze into it
placing the helmet over my head i belted on his weapons which consisted of a short sword and a couple of what i took to be small vacuum grenades
then i stepped boldly through the panel door into the passageway
nobody was in sight
from a distance some place below there came to me through the network of corridors and up the ramps which was used in place of stairs the sounds of a large body of men marching
gradually this sound lessened and since at the same time i heard a confused clamor through the outlet ventilators i judged that a detail of men had been sent outside the castle
this was strange for it was broad daylight and the sun was shining brightly
i knew that something important must be afoot to take the soldiers of enus out into the sun even with the protection of their humidor suits and helmets
after some search through the deserted upper levels of the structure i found a lookout turret from which i could get a good view of the surrounding plain
it was a typical view of that section of mexico a broad plain quivering in the sunlight for the most part arid and bare but with occasional islands of rocky protuberances and patches of povertystricken mesquite
far to the west at a point which was practically the limit of my vision i saw another of the lava fortresses
the sky above it was filled with little flashes of light and puffs of smoke indicating that an attack was being made upon it
ai i gazed a giant dirigible of the air guard in its lowvisibility war paint swung broadside on to my line of vision materializing as it were out of an empty sky
there followed a series of detonations so heavy that i could actually feel the air vibrate
but apparently not even these heavy bombs could break through the fanray film which the invaders had spread above themselves
the little flashes and smoke puffs continued both aloft and below
i glanced downward at the gate of the fortress which i might mention here was not unlike that of a medieval castle if you can imagine one of those old european fortresses done over again in modern factory construction style
a column of soldiers had issued forth and was winding its way across the plain in the direction of the beleaguered fortress
but what interested me most keenly about the column was the method used of protecting it from air attack
in the center marched a column of infantry
to either side of them a column of fanray machines which lumbered along on leverlike legs with a motion not unlike the lurching of our own tanks their generators all turned outward spreading a fan of rays almost horizontal over the tops of still two other flanking columns of machines
these outside columns played their rays upward and inward over the center w of the column the two filmls of rays crossing and furnishing complete protection
the only way in which that column could be reached by steel projectiles of any description was from the ground at flat trajectory
so interested did i become in the attack on the column which i was certain would follow that i forgot the pressing need of making my escape and stood there gazing
from somewhere behind and above there came a steady hissing roar
four venus airships came into view taking up their positions to the rear of the column at a height of about a half mile
nyimeurnior had described these ships to me but this was the first i had seen of them
they were upright cylinders some fifty feet in height and about thirty feet in diameter crowned by an umbrellalike structure a hundred feet in diameter and several feet thick
it was from the top surface that the air was being electronized into vacuum to be rematerialized on the concave under surface
if it were not for the light projecting and bracing steel beams which helped to hold the affairs rigid and also provided landing gear which would not offer the same resistance to the air as a solid platform the things would have looked like giant floating mushrooms
they too floated in what was practically an envelope of inverse magnetic rays the generators being so placed as to cause the beams or rays to cross in every direction
they hung in the air above the column calmly awaiting the swooping attack of our air guard
when it came it was sudden enough
seven squadrons of planes dove headon at the venus ships spitting a steady hail of projectiles zooming successively when they had almost reached the fanray film
but it did no good
the projectiles bounced off that nearly invisible film like rubber balls from a concrete wall
a fruitless attack i to shout at them to use nonmetallic projectiles to which i knew these rays would offer no resistance but of course it was ridiculous to suppose they could hear me
as a matter of fact i could not even signal them for i was shut up in the lookout turret
it was the frantic desire to get this information to my own side which finally prompted me to tear myself away from my point of vantage
even as i did so i saw one of our planes collide with the magnetic wall and hurtle down a crumpled thing while another caught within the effective radius of one of the suction bombs also crumpled and fell
leaving the lookout turret i hurried down through the corridors and ramps with little fear that my disguise would be penetrated soldiers i encountered several times
i had learned much of the manners customs and courtesies of these people from nyimeurnior and gloved and helmeted as i was i was covered from head to foot
nothing but the most searching gaze through my helmet goggles would have revealed the fact that i did not have a dead white skin
at last i reached the passage through which the column had passed but a short time before
there was a sentry on guard just inside the big gate which still was open but he was gazing out after the departing column
i simply elbowed him aside and trotted out over the plain as though i were a tardy member of the expedition hurrying to catch up to the column
i stole a glance back over my shoulder
the plan had worked
he had not been alarmed by my action
i was careful however not to catch up to the column but bore off toward the north when i was sure no attention was being paid to me
then i removed the helmet and stripped off the humidor suit which was a great relief
i think that a half an hour longer in that moisture proof garb under the blazing mexican sun would have drowned or smothered me in my own perspiration
from somewhere to the northwest an artillery barrage was laid down on the invaders column
for a moment i had a thrill of elation
from the confusion it produced i thought it had succeeded in crashing through the magnetic wall
but it had not
there was the usual result shells bouncing harmlessly off and exploding in the air above the column
the confusion evidently was produced by the surprise of the bombardment and the noise for the battery was a long distance away and well hidden
for a while the column halted and the men cowered
but few seemed to take any real alarm
in the end the machines resumed their sluggish progress while the infantry staggered and crouched their way forward quite safe from the explosions above them but far from enjoying it
farther on the column was ambushed by a detachment of our infantry
simultaneously another attack was launched on it from the air
but no success attended the efforts of the earth men
a number of the venus ray generators were raised on extension platforms and the direction of the rays depressed
and i could see that not even a flat trajectory fire could reach the column
as the climax of the attack the planes above withheld their fire and the ground guard threw three waves of infantry against the column but only to wither away under the suction bombs of the coughing guns with which the venusians met them
the earth forces withdrew at last after suffering considerable loss and the men of the column probably with frazzled nerves but with little physical damage continued to wend their tortuous painful way across the plain and entered the other fortress
all this time i had been making my way northward until finally i passed out of sight of the two castles
that night i built a code signal fire and inside half an hour was picked up by a highangle plane which dropped down beside me
the great retreat a a result of radio orders i was sent to washington at once to report to the ordnance board
the knowledge i had gained of the invaders their methods and their machines proved invaluable
not that the air and land guard general boards had not already determined the fact that special projectiles and equipment would be necessary to penetrate the defensive rays of the invaders but i was able to verify many of their conclusions correct certain others and generally expand the fund of knowledge that already had been gathered by the intelligence division
i had a busy two weeks hopping from one office to another on special detail and events moved swiftly in those two weeks
i was myself amazed at the speed with which new guns and new nonmetallic shells and bombs were being turned out and the ingenuity shown by the scientific departments of the guard and by manufacturers in developing a nonmetallic bayonet
troops had to be equipped with canteens belt buckles head gear and buttons and fastenings on their uniforms which had no metal in their construction
the rifle it was determined could not be abandoned but nonmetallic cartridges were developed
the theory was that in passing through the magnetic film of the venusians for handtohand fighting the troops would drop their rifles and use the detached swordbayonets
naturally these things could not be produced overnight nor could the troops be trained in new tactics overnight but so intensively was the work of manufacturing and drilling prosecuted that at the end of two weeks many regiments of the land guard had been reorganized and about a tenth of the air guard had been supplied with nonmetallic bombs
during this period however the two fortresses with which i had been concerned were abandoned their communities drifting lazily and safely southward in their mushroom ships as did many others finally settling in the interior of brazil
perhaps i should pause here to summarize the sequence of events up to this point
nearly two weeks elapsed between the arrivals of the first and last of the bulbs of them landed in the united states in canada in scandinavia in england in france in germany in italy in the balkans and hundreds in the tropic belt all the way around the earth
throughout western europe the land and air forces got into relatively quick action against them
as fast as new spheres descended they were walled in by rings of troops and roofed over as it were by clouds of aircraft
the one which fell in england was destroyed after two days
in france ninewere successfully bombed before they could get their inverse magnetic rays into operation
the crews ot the others managed under fire to erect their fortresses but were so worn out by the neverending bombardments to which they were subjected that they were finally overcome by the charging waves of infantry who had been armed with wooden clubs and short spears
twelve communities fled southward in their air ships but ran into atmospheric conditions that were horrible to them in northern africa where the lack of humidity caused them terrible losses
of the hundreds that landed in africa the majority perished
the remainder made their way either eastward or westward around the equator to the fastnesses of the brazilian jungles where they constructed their great stronghold
at the end of three months none of the invaders remained anywhere in the civilized sections of the temperate zones
the story of those invaders who established themselves in such lands as tibet and siam and how they ultimately perished has not all been unearthed yet from the ruins of the colonies that fell in the united states were destroyed
the others fought their way through our air forces toward the tropics
then there ensued a period of two months in which the invaders and earth men were content to let matters rest while they took stock of the situation and prepared for the greater struggle to come
the men of venus did very little of the raiding they had intended according to the plans nyimeurnior had explained to me during my incarceration
time and again our air fleets coursed over the brazilian forests but seldom did they find evidence of the enemys works
the invaders had learned well to conceal themselves under the leafy protection of the jungle
they had learned too to raise no lava fortresses where they could be seen from above and also to conceal the flow of their volcanic wells
they had little chance of meeting us successfully in the air now for our air fleets had been given bullets and projectiles of nonmetallic construction against which the fanrays of the invaders were of no avail and it became more a matter of sport than anything else among us of the air guard to sight a mushroom ship or squadron and shoot it down
their suction bombs were destructive but we could move too fast for their ships and outclimb them easily
however according to the best estimates there were close to one million of them now established in the brazil jungles where they were busily readjusting themselves to earth conditions constructing their ingenious machines and developing their resources in preparation for a future outbreak which we all feared would be far more devastating than the effects of their haphazard and uncoordinated activities at the time of their arrival upon earth
the paucity of information on their movements in the jungle was ominous
indians staggered into the brazilian military outposts with tales of wholesale and mysterious slaughter of mists that travelled purposefully through the jungles from which ghostmen emerged to slay
y
brazilian military reconnoitering parties went out and failed to return
once a mist cloud moved out of the jungle and enveloped an outpost
when it retreated according to the story of a soldier who had been outside the lines the entire garrison had been massacred
yet these mists were never observed above the tree tops
the earth mobilizes brazilian government had made its formal appeal to the league fo help according to the league constitution and a gigantic army recruited from all the nations in the league was to surround the vast jungle territory
ten million men were to be used for though they would be opposing only about a million of the enemy they would be fighting for nothing less than the existence of the human race and would be facing the unknown
this was the general situation
and while this immense army was being mobilized and equipped a call was made for volunteers who had had contact with the enemy to attempt the highly dangerous work of penetrating the brazilian forests as scouts and spies
and having no better sense volunteered
that was why i found myself ensconced one night in the upper branches of a tree far in the interior in a section where i had finally found evidences of activity
i wore an imitation humidor suit that was an imitation only in its clever arrangement for ventilation
it was in fact a real venus garment which for the moment was suspended on my chest like an oldfashioned gas mask but was in reality a gas mask and several other things besides
in my hands i held a little box a tiny radio broadcasting set scattered around me through the forest at strategic points were carefully concealed bombs and flares each tuned so that by pressing the proper button on the box i might set off any particular bomb or flare by radio impuse
i had spent the day planting these mines among which were a a number of gas bombs
all these arrangements were precautions of self defense
i had no intention of carrying on a campaign singlehanded
but i had picked the spot for several days patient observation for it was here that i had noted several fresh trails that appeared to my unwoodsmanlike eye to converge and come to an end for no reason whatever in a little clearing not far from the tree in which i was hiding
a quarter of a mile away carefully hidden i had one of our new helicopters developed by the air guard a machine that was powerful and as nearly silent in its operation as any device using an air propeller could be and far beyond sight a great dirigible was awaiting my communications
but since nothing at all happened that night and no sounds came to my straining ears except those of the normal animal life of the jungle i determined the next night to try an experiment
i waited until after midnight and then pressed a button on my radio control box which resulted in a terrific explosion about a quarter of a mile farther on in the jungle
i got the flash of it even through the dense growth of the jungle and my tree trembled with the force of the detonation
immediately there was a series of purplish flashes in the sky above that spot which merged into a continuous mass of pulsating lights as the preliminary thunderclaps grew into a continuous roar
my experiment had proved profitable
i had learned something
i knew those flashes and thunderclaps as the product of the coughing guns of the enemy
but the power of this barrage exceeded by far anything i had seen while a prisoner among them
as suddenly as the uproar had begun it ceased
and silence once more settled over the jungle
it was evident that i had stumbled into the neighborhood of a venus artillery post and no mean one
my bomb had been mistaken for one dropped from an airplane
the next day i searched for the location of that battery but could not find it
the night following i slept but devoted the day after that to another painstaking search of the jungle
at last i found a spot where the foliage of the trees above me appeared to have been shredded and torn
i searched the ground carefully
my patience was rewarded by the discovery of a beautifully designed camouflage a screen of moss and leaves which concealed a pit
the battery was buried under ground and fortunately for me must have been unmanned and unguarded at the moment although this did not surprise me knowing as i did how the invaders hated our atmosphere in the daylight even when wearing their humidor suits
the gun crew i was sure was also somewhere below ground probably sleeping and the sentry who must have had some post of vantage from which he could see the sky was evidently so placed that he could not observe the floor of the forest
as quietly as i could and i must admit with some fear i slipped away to where one of my bombs was concealed and carried it carefully to the pit where i concealed it in some undergrowth nearby
that night i took up a new post in a tree from which i could see the mouth of the pit and detonated another of my bombs some distance away
the phenomena of several nights before was repeated in the air but i did not watch it this time
i kept my attention centered upon the mouth of the pit
the screen had been blown aside and so fast was the buried gun firing it seemed to be only one that its discharges blended into a continuous faintly luminescent column that tore through the upper branches of the trees
after a bit the gun ceased firing
about a quarter of an hour elapsed
then a faint light appeared near the mouth of the pit by which i could observe the figures of a half a dozen invaders
two of them were nakedwhite in the soft warm tropical night but the others wore their suits and helmets
one of them was placing a new screen over the mouth of the gun pit
others were carefully gathering up the debris torn from the trees above
my first instinct was to slip to the ground and creep up on them
i felt that in the darkness it would not be noticed that there was an additional member of their party and i might be able to follow them underground
but caution prevailed and i determined first to communicate my discoveries to the dirigible somewhere in the sky above
we had planned an ingenious method of doing this
with the first grey light of dawn i felt my way back through the jungle to the spot whre i had left my helicopter for my radio would not have been powerful enough to reach the ship nor would i have dared to use one for a continuous message
the enemy might have picked it up and located me
the small amount of power and mere instantaneous spark that i used to detonate my bombs did not matter
from one of the compartments of the helicopter i took a tiny model of the same sort equipped with a little chemical engine
the whole thing was little bigger than a cigar box
i wrote my report and attached it to the model which i shot vertically into the air
when it was five thousand feet up it would automatically broadcast a range finding signal and emit a faint smoke trail which would enable one of our planes to pick it up
it would rise under its power for many hours then drift down on a little parachute and finally if not picked up by the time it drifted below the level it would burn destroying the message
into the tunnel the rest of the day for i expected to be very busy that night
after nightfall i returned to my post near the gun pit but did not climb the tree
instead i hid behind its vast trunk and pressed the button that would detonate the bomb i had placed near the gun pit
it blew a great gash in the ground and must have put the gun out of commission for no roaring barrage followed but a short time afterward ten or twelve soldiers broke through a screen of creepers and by the faint light of hand lamps excitedly inspected the crater my bomb had torn at the edge of their gun pit
they jabbered laconically in their strange shorthand tongue frequently pointing upward
i circled and came up behind them joining their party yet not getting too close to the others as i made a pretense of searching the ground and looking fearfully up toward the sky where only a couple of stars were visible through the dense foliage
after a bit their leader a man bigger than the rest who had not donned his humidor suit grunted a command and one by one they disappeared through the screen of creeping vines
i approached with the rest but hung back a bit hoping the commander would go in ahead of me
but he did not and in the end he grunted an angry command
he must have become suspicious as i passed him
possibly he had been counting and realized that he had an extra man
at any event he reached out and grasped my arm
but i was on the alert for such a danger
twisting quickly i drove my fist against his unprotected jaw and he went down like a log
and pushing my way through the screen i found myself in a cleverly concealed passageway which slanted down below the ground level
following the lights of the others around a couple of turns i came upon a section of corridor that was dimly lighted
after a bit we came to a junction of several corridors and the men turned sharply to the left down a small tunnel
i paused a moment to take stock of this structure and if possible get my bearings
my little compass made several things clear
the tunnel the men had followed evidently led back to the gun pit
a main corridor much larger stretched away in a great curve to the south
another curved gently northward
and toward the west a third one larger than any of the others slanted downward at a sharp angle
in the big chamber where these corridors came together which incidentally reminded much of one of our old subway stations in new york were a number of big complicated pieces of machinery
they were not in operation at the moment however
from down the big west shaft came a distant murmur which little by little grew in intensity until i finally thought it advisable to seek cover
i hid behind one of the machines
the murmur grew into a roar
the roar increased
and there shot out of the tunnel into the big station where it came to an easy but quick stop a great projectilelike car
it had no wheels but apparently rode on two systems of magnetic devices one running like a spine along the top the other like a keel along the bottom
as i noticed this the car settled down a few inches and rested with a bump on the lavalike floor
several doors in the side opened and a stream of soldiers began to troop out
at the same moment several of the gun crew came running out of the small corridor
they made their way immediately to the commanding officer of the newcomers evidently a man of high rank from the breadth of the belt he wore and the numerous insignia appearing on it and made their report in some excitement
they knew by now of course that their battery commander was missing
he replied angrily
i gathered from his impatient gestures that he was reprimanding them for not returning to the jungle to seek their officer
and i realized i was facing a crisis
but i dared not come from behind the machine to join the throng at this juncture for none of them was in a humidor suit and i would have attracted unwelcome attention instantly
i was forced therefore to watch the squad which rushed off at once toward the exit to the forest and see my retreat cut off
it struck me that strategically speaking it was high time for a diversion if on finding their commander outside they were not to start an imme340 diate search of the tunnels
so i drew my radio detonator out and pressed one of its buttons then another and finally a third
there was only one explosion which came to my ears faintly and muffled from a point some three hundred yards away in the forest
the other two bombs would make no noise
one was a smoke bomb which would so smother their hand lamps that they would hardly be able to see their hands before their faces
the third was a gas bomb and would give those who breathed its fumes something new to think about i hoped for as long as they were able to think
as i expected a detachment of only twelve men or so was sent out to investigate
another detachment armed with tools and implements of various descriptions ran down the corridor toward the gun pit and soon the sound of their apparatus was clanging in my ears
a party from the gun pit came back and after reporting to the commander who was pacing up and down impatiently ran to one of the machines near that behind which i was hiding
they swarmed over it manipulating little wheels and levers
and to my surprise the mass of machinery which reminded me something of a small newspaper printing press lumbered to leverlike feet and shambled away down the tunnel to the pit
every few moments the commander glanced impatiently toward the forestexit corridor
finally he motioned to one of the girls in the ranks behind him for as i mentioned before they seemed to make no distinction as to sex when it came to labor or military service and she ran off toward the exit
but she did not return
nor did any of the others
i opined that my gas was working nicely and now bitterly regretted that i had failed to fill my pouch with gas grenades from my helicopter
at last the officer barked an order
the rest of the soldiers broke ranks unstrapped their humidor suits from their belts and donned them
another order and they all moved briskly away toward the exit trailing their short spears
i slipped into the rearmost ranks and went along with them for my purpose now was to regain my helicopter and send up another message to the dirigible explaining what i had seen of their corridors and system of underground structures
guerilla warfare head of the column passed out through the screen of creepers
others followed
then suddenly the column recoiled
some of those nearest the screen sank down gasping and choking
others staggered and leaned against the walls
through the confusion i could see that some of them had torn away the foliage of the screen revealing the piled up bodies beyond
at this moment a gust of wind sent a billow of the black smoke surging into the corridor
the rest of the column turned and fled from it crowding back down the corridor
i chuckled as i crouched to let them pass my gas mask in place for i remembered the rumors that had reached us of these people leaping from white fogs that roamed the surface of the jungle
the black fog and deadly gases of earth laboratories were reversing the terror
as the last of the fleeing enemy disappeared around the bend in the corridor i arose and made my way to the outer blackness where i stumbled around for more than an hour before i won free from my own black fog and gas and located my helicopter
at dawn i shot another baby heli up with my report and filled my pouches with gas and smoke grenades
i wanted to return and get a more comprehensive idea of the extent of their corridor systems for i was convinced by now that the whole invaders population had taken to burrowing into the earth
in digging their volcanic shafts it would be no impossible task for them to adapt their wonderful machines for fashioning the lava product into underground corridors and chambers instead of the castles or fortresses they had first built above ground
if this were the case our armies were going to have some little task ahead of them in digging them out
i did not have an opportunity to pursue my investigations further at that time however for i had hardly turned from my helicopter when i became conscious of the slight continuous buzz in my radio box that was the prearranged signal ordering my return to the dirigible
so regretfully i climbed into the machine started the motor and opening the throttle roared up through the tree tops
before i had gone far i was sighted by the enemy and suction bombs began to burst around me
stunned by the thunderclap of one of these i lost consciousness not to awake until several hours later in one of the bunks of the dirigible
for several weeks thereafter all i saw of the war was from the air
i was attached to one of the new superdirigibles as a plane scout
the was one of the first of those dirigibles that kept permanently to the air and docked only at infrequent periods as the battleships of old took to their dry docks only for repairs
the big ship cruised above the utmost range of the coughing guns and most of the time was unable to see the surface of the ground owing to atmospheric conditions
a regular patrol was maintained however
i and fifteen other pilots would catapult our planes down out of the big outlet port in the ships lower hull drop like stones to the point of visibility and then cruise our beats climbing again to land gently on the great top deck of the ship
it was in reality dull work
we saw little below with our own eyes but the endless stretch of the tropic forest
but we kept our cameras grinding and the subsequent development and comparison of our films revealed much to the staff that could not have been gathered by haphazard visual observation
these films for instance showed at times where new venus batteries had been expertly camouflaged below the floor of the forest inflammite eggs in their new nonmetallic casings worked marvellous changes in the topography at such spots and must have permanently discouraged all nearby invaders
still we didnot get any too many of the batteries
suction bombs climbed up toward us all too frequently from unspotted guns
it became obvious that we could not destroy the enemy from the air without blowing an impossibly large section of brazil off the map and that the enemy had no intention of coming up into the air to meet us
there was but one alternative
the ground army would have to close in on them from the sides and probably dig down as it went
the ring closes in i fortunate enough to be the observer of a number of actions when finally the ring began to tighten
the description of one serves for nearly all of them
it opened with the innumerable flashes and concussions of divisional artillery over a sector probably five miles wide and ten deep
these flashes were but faintly visible from my extreme height
more vivid was the seething churning flaming forest where the shells fell
somewhere on the edge of this churning area was our first infantry line
then the barrage ceased and i dived for a closer view and a better opportunity to cooperate
like a swarm of ants i could see our men penetrating painfully and slowly it seemed into the devastated sector
then at several spots in front and behind the writhing advancing line little clouds of white mist puffed out from openings that bubbled up in the churned area as though made by tiny moles
these clouds expanded
then they began to move in definitely controlled directions
the invaders must have had some form of magnetic control with which they dragged these enveloping mists around with them
some enveloped sections of our first line and from my position in the air i could see the broken ends of the lines at such spots pivot back into new positions to prevent a rolling up of the flanks
two or three of the groundmist clouds suddenly evaporated uncovering enemy detachments of from to men
one was caught between a cross fire of two machinegun companies and wiped out in a trice
another was equipped with fanray machines but the invaders quickly abandoned these when they found they were not stopping the new nonmetallic bullets of the earth forces
one cloud i noticed suddenly became motionless a great dome of mist about yards in diameter swaying under the pressure of the gentle breeze as though it were a halffilled balloon
and it stayed motionless
a spotting plane swooped low over it and zoomed for a little radio chat with its battery
an instant later a veritable hail of shrapnel tore thrugh the intangible mass but apparently without affecting it
then from a nearby ridge one of our gas details liberated a great billowing cloud of smudgy vapor that rolled down on it like a tidal wave
the vapor flowed around over and even through it but the mistywhite swaying dome still showed
i saw shadowy grotesquely masked infantry pick its way down the slope from the ridge and with cautious yet alert decision plunge into the mysterious quivering mist
the wave of smudgy vapor rolled on and a moment later the mist also suddenly evaporated in tenous swirling wisps that were carried along by the breeze in the wake of the rolling smoke
only the infantry detail was there
of venusians there was no sign except the single figure stretched prone on the ground beside a little portable machine of complicated appearance
i learned later that this was the machine that controlled the mist by creating what for want of a better name we called a magnetic field although the force involved was not magnetism despite certain manifestations similar to magnetic phenomena
this particular mistcloud was a decoy a camouflage
the enemy had set his control machine on the ground and was about to sneak for safety but the shrapnel blast hit the misty dome a bit too soon for him
the accelerated advance of our second line of infantry ended the engagement
they plunged ahead in open order with supports concentrating on those spots where the line swept through the mistclouds
curtains obviously cloaking enemy artillery were suddenly rent but not dissipated by pale flashes from within
others hiding details of enemy infantry awaited the onsweeping line quietly or moved slowly toward it
it was around in and through these that the heaviest fighting handtohand work swirled and eddied
but the line swept on engulfed the broken fragments of the first line and in the end slowly surged into the dense forest beyond the area that had been torn up by the barrage while the third line which had now come up sent details of moppersup scouring through the area of the engagement
reserves had been rushed forward quickly in the hope that we might penetrate the tunnels from which the invaders had emerged
but in each case it was found that these tunnels had been blasted behind them by the retiring enemy and had caved in
innumerable engagements of this nature were fought through this period of the war
the fighting was heavy but the progress of the campaign slow for the enemy occupied a vast area about as large as a matter of fact as france
in actual number of men per square mile the lines were not nearly as tightly drawn as they were in the old world war but when the increased efficiency range and coordi342 nation of the machinery of warfare was taken into account they were in effect more tightly drawn than they were in that old crude struggle and there was far more finesse in strategy and tactics displayed by both sides
the mobilization of science cleverly were the strategic phases of the cam paign planned and carried out that it was a long time before we ourselves sensed that the idea of our high command was to drive two wedges into opposite sides of the area occupied by the unearthly enemy until they finally met and separated them into two areas with the hope that in the process these wedges would pierce or bring us within close striking distance of one or more of the enemys main bases
whether he had few or many we did not know
no system of espionage could penetrate very far into the lines of an enemy who had nothing in common with us of earth except superficial physical resemblance
no man of venus could be tempted to betray his species by any offers earth men could make
few prisoners could be made to talk and those who did had little of value to tell of the plans or dispositions of their own forces
most of them committed suicide almost immedi ately on being taken
during this period all the scientific resources of earth were mobilized in grim determination to find methods of checkmating the peculiar sciences and strategies of the invaders from space
vast areas back of our lines had to be carefully guarded for the enemy boring machines could burrow deep under the surface of the ground with relative rapidity and the rear of no fighting division was ever safe
time and again the enemy surged up out of the ground far in our rear in locally overwhelming numbers taking terrific toll before entire divisions could be pivoted and reserves brought up to enclose them and choke them back into their tunnels
we knew they had to have air ventilating systems in their tunnels and underground communities
the weather bureaus of the whole world furnished their experts to study air currents over the enemy area
spectroscopic ultrared and ultraviolet telescopes were developed in the hope that long range chemical analyses of the air might betray the proximity of ventilating outlets or intakes
electromagnetic instruments of the utmost sensitivity were invented in the hope of detecting the presence of machinery underground
penetrative rocketbombs were developed great projectiles to be dropped from aircraft which after falling a safe distance would automatically develop their rocket power and plunge earthward with acceleration and momentum many times that of gravity to penetrate far into the ground before they exploded
to see one of these shells hit the ground was a sight indeed
it would throw up an earthspout from to feet high
then after a terrible pause would come an aweinspiring muffled rumbling roar and the surface of the ground for a quarter to a half mile in every direction would heave and surge and settle down again with trees frequently still standing but crazily tilted and askew the concussion underground must have been deadly to any living beings in tunnels within a great distance of the explosion
high enough in the air we did not mind
but when we dived too close to the surface the effect was deadening to the senses
at first many of our aviators met death through loss of control over themselves and their machines due to the concussion
but of all the locating devices we used the microphonic types proved the most practical of all
of these there were two kinds audio and radio
it was the former that had by far the more general value
it was simple in principle
a thin shaft would be sunk in the ground to a depth of feet or more and into this would be lowered a multiple microphone device each microphone element being carefully soundinsulated from its fellows and directionally pointed and each having its amplifying units
operators listened at audio receivers for sounds identified as mechanical
and readers developed marvelous facility in interpreting the composite and individual graphs that the light needles made on sensitized paper as permanent records
the radio finders were not of course really microphones but rather highly sensitive and carefully shielded radio receivers of a specialized type which were grounded to the air above thus reversing the usual procedure
they picked up the ground waves of static given off by enemy machinery of an electrical nature
little by little our scientists learned to detect with fair accuracy the presence of the enemy underfoot within a distance of a mile or more according to the nature of the surface and the subsoil and for the most part this proved sufficient to prevent their mining under our positions without detection
the success of these finders in turn was probably responsible for their last desperate move in turning loose the volcanic forces which had proved their undoing on their own planet and were fated to bring about their downfall again on ours
finding they could no longer burrow under our cordon without discovery and subsequent annihilation from our ground penetrating rockets they took the chance of tampering with the internal heat of a strange planet
the first we knew of the cataclysmic forces to be let loose was when the upper amazon river suddenly dwindled and dried
it had been diverted from its course quite obviously somewhere within the enemy territory
it was only a matter of hours before our air scouts found the place where a great chasm had been opened across the river bed into which the waters were roaring and tumbling
but that was all the good it did us
dropping penetrative bombs to kill any of the enemy who might be hidden under ground in the neighborhood did not interrupt the waterfall that tumbled into the depths of the earth
nor were all the explosives we could pour into the chasm sufficient to cave it in or close it up
vast masses of earth were blasted loose within and around the great hole but the water washed it down before it had a chance to clog them up
cataclysm i our scientists had a pretty good idea of what was to come for the high command suddenly got very busy
there was a hasty shifting of divisions and even army corps without any reason then apparent
certain geological areas were hastily evacuated
in some of them the troop movements were incompleted when the cataclysm occurred
hundreds of square miles of the earth suddenly heaved and boiled at the outcroppings of certain strata and there began to flow down the valleys and ravines and along the river beds viscous streams of flaming smoking allconsuming lava
a number of regiments and one whole division were cut off marooned by the flaming flood that finally consumed them
our line generally was thrown into confusion by its drastic readjustments and the effect on morale was far from good
the troops were keyed up to fight it out desperately with the interplanetary invaders
but how could they fight such vast forces of nature
in this moment of confusion the invaders who either by intention or accident had released forces that threatened to be more destructive to themselves than to us suddenly launched their great attack or migratory onslaught westward toward the slopes of the andes which were well back of our advanced lines on that side
they had to break through or perish by the forces they had themselves conjured up
the deploying of our defense was far from smooth in view of the prevailing chaos and so sudden was the attack that there was no time to shift many divisions from the east to the west front
up into the jungle out of their countless underground burrows came the enemy hordes in their helmeted suits their great machines clanging grinding plowing blasting and slicing paths through the heavy vegetation for them
they abandoned the niceties of military tactics and came on en masse
the pale flashes of their suction guns faintly illuminated the jungles endlessly in all directions and a gargantuan inferno of shrieking and exploding shells tore air forest and ground to pieces in front of them as they plowed onward
our first line went down before them as a childs tiny sand fort is engulfed by the tide
it had no time to retire
our second line evacuated its positions to a depth of several miles while our air forces and ground artillerly cut into the game with a terrific counter barrage
so heavy was the air fire that i and my companion scouts were ordered into the mother ship for fear we might be annihilated by the rain of shells from above
far far to the east i could see the pall of lava smoke
below in every direction the surface of the earth actually was obliterated by a noxious haze shot through by the pale and flaming flashes of the venus and the earth artillery
together with the other plane pilots i stood in the observation room of the great dirigible
but our roles of spectators were to be interrupted
col benner came in hurriedly
to your planes he snapped where we do a diveout and get into it umbrella ships reported below general plane mobilization ordered fifteen miles east 000foot level going to ride the tail of the whole enemy army and strafe out of em in the open now where their barrage has sliced down the jungle go
one after another we nosedived out of the keel of the big ship and streaked eastward in a loose string climbing as we went
morq than planes or six full divisions mobilized at the rendezvous
as far as i could see aloft and below the air was filled with the droning bugs circling by flights thirty planes to a flight regiment above regiment ten flights to a regiment brigade over brigade four regiments each and division beside division of three brigades each
for twenty minutes we circled perfecting formations and waiting for the late comers from the eastern front
then from a mere fly speck in the distance a position that must have been roughly over the rear of the enemy flashed the general orders on which every one of the pilots tuned in
regiment by regiment nosed down dived for speed and streaked down and away in continuously flattening formations until viewed in perspective from where i circled they seemed like a vast sheet of immense length and width but no thickness skimming away from me through the hazy air
then came our turn
down we went the roar and hum of motors and wings swelling into a shrieking whining crescendo
for a while it was all i could do to hold formation but as my senses automatically reacted from the effects of the heavy acceleration and my nerves tensed to a sharper coordination
i began to scan the haze below and ahead
far to the right and below came the flash of a suction bomb
it must have been feet below our level but from the corner of my eye i saw an entire flight sucked down into the vacuum the planes struggling crazily for control
there were blinding flashes from below and ahead now too and other bugs individually and in groups were sucked down out of formation
destruction of the umbrella ships a this time we were slanting down at an angle with ever accelerating speed
the contours of the ground took on definite form then the rolling masses of jungle and the churned surface of the earth far ahead
finally the masses of greyuniformed helmeted invaders became distinguishable struggling writhing forward in massed groups and columns
somewhere ahead our first line contacted with the umbrella ships it rose while continued on page the bases of the cylinders went through the floor of the cavern
their spinning movement created a terrific suction for the air in the cavern was swirling
attached to the cylinders were hundreds of small tubes that gave off a deep green ray

they go into the cave hoping to find allie lane there and the wall of the opening mysteriously blocked up
they find themselves lost and are suddenly surrounded by strange sevenfoot beings with faces like frogs
they have tentacles above their heads and by these establish telepathic communication with the two visitors
a shot is fired at one of the beings but from his forehead a greenish fluid runs out and the wound closes up without damage to him
they close in on the two men and pick them up
sands and i were carried on the broad chests of the mysterious creatures far into the cavern
they made several abrupt descents and the oppressive air told me that we were far below the surface of the manalava plain their movements were rapid and forceful and their long skinny legs bore their weight remarkably well although they wabbled like strutting geese
during the entire course the tunnel was brilliant with changing colors of various hues from green to red and vermilion everchanging
as i lay cradled in the tentaclelike arms of the big brute who carried me i smelled his evil breath
the odor was the same nauseating smell that had curled our nostrils and threatened to explode our lungs on several occasions since we entered the cavern
with each slow blink of his eyelids there was an accompanying metallic click
occasionally he opened his toadlike mouth and when he closed it hard bony lips snapped like the spring of a trap
sands was being borne along by a broadbacked creature in front of me
i could see his head bobbing with each wobbly step of the beast and i knew that he was unconscious felt worried about sands
the grip of the big fellows arm around his throat could have broken the spine of an ox without any effort
i cursed the brutes venomously
the fellow bearing me tightened his grip around my chest and i was forced to gasp for breath
when i became quiet he loosened his hold
i felt a searing welt rise across my body
presently we were carried into a great circular chamber far below the surface of the manalava plain the chamber was luminous with the strange pale green color
in the center spun a huge glowing sphere and it was surrounded by smaller spheres each spinning in an atmosphere of its own like the earth with its suns and moons revolving around it
the huge ball in the center seemed to float in air ed earl repp without any visible support
the smaller spheres likewise spun in midair at perhaps a fortyfive degree angle from the large one
they emitted a highpitched whine as they spun
my eyes now accustomed to the luminous glow searched every corner of the chamber
to the right standing on a flat rock platform were three massive chairs of green metal that was studded with precious stones
the chairs were vacant lined around the circular chamber were several hundred more of the grotesque creatures who had carried sands and i far into the underground world
they stood motionless as though at attention
from deep in the bowels of the earth came a clanging of bells and each creature in the chamber with the exception of the two who bore sands and i across their chests hung their heads
i heard the scraping of rock against rock over to my right and i allowed my gaze to wander there huge circular slab of rock was rolling away from an entrance into the chamber
i watched it intently until its removal exposed a glittering doorway
i had become so engrossed in watching the door that i failed to notice that i was being carried toward the platform
as i was borne nearer to the three chairs i observed standing in the opening the majestic figure of a huge bestial creature bedecked in purple and gold robes of a metal that glistened blindingly
the fellow carrying me halted before the platform and placed me on the floor
the tall figure in the doorway moved quickly out of the entrance and walked stifflegged toward the chairs
from his dignity i at once accepted him as the king or chief of the it is a bit unethical for the editor to wax enthusiastic about any story but we certainly could not help mentally applauding when we first read the radium pool
not since the moon pool has there been such a story and the second part which we are presenting to you now is certainly by far the better part of the story
the adventure interest accumulates gradually and with neverending vigor the story leaps from adventure to science so when finally one lays the story aside it seems as if an entirely new world had been opened to you a world that is as strange as it will be unforgettable
and if you read the story ten times you will not fail to be thrilled at the tenth reading as you were at the first grotesque frogmen
i stood erect my gaze following him
he appeared not to take the slightest interest in me
i looked around as he neared what i accepted as his throne
sands was lying still on the broad chest of the brute who had carried him in
his head hung loosely on his shoulders
disconso346 lately my gaze again returned to the majestic hgure on the throne
he sat stiffly the tubes above his eyes waving slowly
while my interest was centered on sands lifeless body two other beings had followed the high chief onto the throne and sat in the chairs on either side of him
to my uttermost surprise i beheld two human beings sitting beside the high chief one on either side and one was a young woman gayly adorned in brilliant robes of purple and gold
her wealth of golden brown hair shimmered in the pale green light of the chamber
her eyes were motionless and she looked out over the room like one in a trance
her finely cut features and appealing blue eyes caused my pulse to beat more rapidly than ever before in all my life
my whole body tingled with exaltation
i had an impression that her features bore a distinct resemblance to some beautiful face that i had seen before
she stared straight ahead with unblinking eyes
i was unable to remove my eyes from her
where had i seen that fascinating clearcut face
whose features were they
ah had it
instantly i decided to look again at the photograph sands had found in the old album back at the spring
perhaps it was the photograph that had given me the impression of having at some past time beheld the gentle features of the girl walked unmolested over to sands limp form and reached inside his vest
he was beginning to show signs of life when i brought forth the wellpreserved photograph that he said was the picture of allie lane for whom we had been searching
every owlish eye in that great assembly of unearthly beings was riveted on me as i strode photograph in hand toward the platform
the dignified leader sat motionless on the throne and regarded me through saucerlike orbs
i felt even though no sounds issued from his mouth that he was conversing steadily with pur capturers
the tubes just above his broad forehead waved in all directions as though catching thought waves being broadcast by the others in the chamber
the girl sat in stony immobility
the man on the other side of the high chief was likewise motionless his eyes staring straight ahead
the man was slightly wrinkled around the mouth though he looked to be no older than thirty
his jet black hair which had been freshly combed glistened as from oil
was this man alfred forsythe lane father of the beautiful girl whose trail led us to the edge of the radium pool
hardly i thought
at the edge of the platform i halted photograph held up before my eyes
for a moment i was utterly stunned
the photograph showed the same delicately rounded chin finely shaped lips and radiant blue eyes that marked the beauty of the girl in the chair i stumbled backward a few steps in my astonishment
lane
i must have shouted at the top of my lungs for i heard a patter of feet that brought driftin sands to my side
i looked at him
his face was white even under the luminous green glow that affected him
god he breathed in amazement
allie with a leap sands jumped to her side on the platform
an inquisition the high chief raised an arm a menacingly and a thin shaft of green light shot from the suckerlike tip at the end
sands placed a wearied hand over his eyes a small round spot the color of chalk appeared on his brow as he sank to the floor heavily
allie lane moved her finely shaped head with its brown hair hanging in thin wisps curled around her temples and stared blankly at her fallen lover
she quivered slightly and raised her dainty white hands to her temples as though striving to bring a return of memory
presently she gave it up with a shudder and continued to stare straight in front of her
the gaze rested upon me i felt and i shifted my own uneasily helplessly
the grotesque people of the underground had displayed their protective powers on several occasions and i was aware of what my fate would be if i interfered to aid my friend
whether sands was dead or merely stunned i could not guess but i accepted the former readily enough
expecting momentarily to feel the tingle of radium rays carrying me into oblivion i hung my head
i stood limply at the edge of the platform full of sorrow over the turn of affairs
here was sands at the end of a fortyyear search for his lost sweetheart the only living thing that had kept him alive and there was allie lane probably broken in mind and spirit and unable to go to him
now i thought his life was snuffed out while he stood on the very verge of complete happiness
i offered a prayer to our maker to reunite them again and let them enjoy the happiness that was theirs by right of nature and heritage didnot think how strange it was at the time for allie lane to be sitting there as fresh in the glory of youth as she was when the photograph had been made of her back in kansas city forty years ago i only knew that we had found her
i looked at sands
he was lying in a heap where he had fallen
no move had been made on the part of the giant tunneldwellers to aid him
certainly i could not one move and i would meet with the same fate
i was not ready to die
i strained hard to think of some way to help him to learn if he was dead
my mind was a blank and seemed not to function
some irresistible influence was smothering all thought
it was then i realized that i was being questioned by the high chief on the throne
i cast a quick glance past allie lane at him
his antennae tubes were pointed straight toward me
i felt the strange power that seemed to pass from his tubes to my mind
i shuddered for it gave me a terrific pain at the base of my nevertheless i steeled myself for the ordeal of questioning that i knew would follow
a peculiar feeling came over me
i felt that i was gradually rising out of my physical body
it was an incredible sensation
then my brain grasped a vibratory mental question
i seemed in a trance
you man of the earth what brings you into forbidden country
the peculiar eerie question gave me a faint feeling that some time in the dim past i had heard it asked of me through a similar process
i glanced down at my feet
they were invisible
i seemed to hang eyes only suspended in a murky haze
before me on the throne sat the three silent figures glowing brightly and tinged with a greenish hue
sands inert body seemed to have vanished
i strove to answer my questioner
my lips moved but i could hear no words
my brain told me that an answer was taking definite shape but it would not be the answer the monster sought country here in america
i answered him silently
why you must be crazy
at that his saucerlike eyes blinked rapidly
his froglike beak opened and a red fiery tongue flicked out of a luminous opening that was his throat
the chamber was in stony silence
only the click of the high huge eyelids broke the stillness
you man of the earth the words telegraphed to my brain
dare you jest with me
do you know that abaris second in command of jupiter and the entire universe have the power and the right to forbid anything or condemn any world his words struck me as inexplicably funny
how silly and absurd i thought was this sudden boast of power from such a hideous grotesque freak
had he ever heard of the great armies of the united states that could fly over the manalava plain and annihilate his entire band of froglike freaks
hardly i thought
i felt my lips curl up in scorn at his vanity what right have you to condemn and destroy
i asked more controlled
his flat beak opened in a froggish attempt to laugh
a peculiar cackling sound issued from his cavernous throat
he seemed to be enjoying himself hugely
for a lowly creature like yourself man of the earth who is doomed you speak strong words
what right have i to annihilate you
why ignorant one i have the right by all the power of the universe
i have the power of civilization ten million years in advance of your aboriginal powers we your superiors by milleniums could condemn your earth to complete and instantaneous destruction should we so desire
this lengthy message telegraphed to my stunned brain caused me to wonder what sort of beings these creatures were from where they had come and what was their mission here
certainly the owleyed freak talked like a military lord
i began to feel that i was the proverbial mouse and the cat was merely playing with me for hist own amusement
the strange power the high chief had displayed in striking sands to the floor awed me considerably
of a certainty we men on earth boasted of no such strange weapons that shot pencilthin light rays and killed instantly and silently
perhaps this giant freak was not boasting after all
in spite of my sudden fears that perhaps this tribe of strange creatures might be able to bring into play powers far superior to our own i still felt contempt and scorn for them
to have my partner my friend in years of toil and sorrow suddenly struck down by the beasts when he had found joy was enough to bring out my hatred
the fact that they held captive two human beings like myself one a woman under a strange influence only piled fuel onto the fires of my fury
what have you done with my friend abaris great and exalted ruler of the boundless universe
i sneered contemptuously a great and glorious ruler as you must take great pleasure in striking down an unarmed man smite the hand that harms man of the earth his soundless words shot back hostilely was not the hand that harms brave abaris
his was the hand of love and loyalty with a mind of sorrow and grief
abaris explains this juncture i shot a glance at allie lane profile was beautiful as she turned toward the grotesque creature sitting majestically at her side
her eyes looked up into the owlish orbs appealingly
my heart jumped suddenly and i felt a lump rising in my throat
the high chief abaris looked down at her though wide lids
one of his snaky tubelike arms writhed upward and encircled her soft shoulders
his head tubes hung drooped in apparent affection for this beautiful girl for whom sands had spent the best part of his life in constant search
i cursed the huge beast roundly understood it now
the frightful brute had saved allie lane from a horrible death and through some process unknown to man he had retained within her the youth and beauty that was hers when he found her at the edge of the radium pool
he must have jealously guarded that youth through the passing of the years that had made
sands her loyal suitor an old and broken man
what was the secret of the strange process
was it the radioactive qualities of the radium that had retained her youth as well as restore the youth of driftin sands
if so then why hadnot i gone through the same change
then i remembered that sands had accidentally dipped his fingers into the radium pool burning off the tips
the radium must then have sent lifegiving qualities surging through his veins and restored the worn and frayed nerves and tissue of his body the same injection but through a different process i thought must have been applied to the youthful body of allie lane
her father too must necessarily have gone through the same procedure else how could he have been restored to youth
why had he been permitted to live at all
surely now his years had passed the century mark
but i thought allie lane would have been better off had she died at the pool
with such a beast as the frogfeatured abaris constantly in her vision and showering her with his affections a terrible life at best must have been hers and abaris must have read sands thoughts too before he struck the man down
he seemed to take great pride in his possession of the beautiful feminine creature i felt and guarded her zealously from pthers
suddenly my subconscious mind reeled under the pressure of abaris strange power of mental telepathy
he rolled his great bald head aside and with owlish eyes languidly regarded me
my gaze became fastened on his steadily blinking lids
their metallic as they opened and closed sounded dismally throughout the chamber which was now lighted only with a pale green glow
the three figures on the throne a deeper green but tinged with a brilliant red aurora sat quietly
i wondered what had become of driftin sands
abaris grotesque features stood out abruptly and seemed almost as fair as allie lane and her father under the mixture of colors that glowed from the green and red hues
his great eyes bored into mine so deeply that i felt a sudden panic seize me
you ignorant man of the earth have seen the power of jupiter greatest and most powerful planet in the universe
abaris words booming and unspoken reached my mind
i thought it strange that these grotesque beings could converse in my own language and by mental process at that
yes i admitted reluctantly have seen them but do you know that one of our american bombing planes could fly over here and blow you and your crowd to hell
abaris froglike features parted in a grin
his throat rattled mirthfully
i stared at him awed
hoh hoh hoooah my mind throbbed under the force of his booming mental laugh
why lowly worm he shot his tubes pointing straight at me if i but minded to i could destroy your entire world with one little globule of radium
what do you mean i asked with a sudden desire to learn all i could concerning these strangers and their aweinsipiring powers this
abaris said evenly and with sarcasm we of jupiter are so far your superiors that you are but worms in comparison
when your people were still clinging by their tails we of jupiter had already mastered mathematics
during the years that followed and developed you to your present state we of jupiter mastered many sciences one of which brings us to your world now
that is radium
we have mastered radium in all its forms and we are therefore masters of the universe and all life in it
well i said why didnot you destroy us here on earth then if you are so powerful
how did you get here on this earth if your planet is jupiter
we man of the earth he said amused as though enjoying the mental conversation immensely and taking great pride in the vast knowledge of his people we do not take life without cause even though that life is no more to us than your reptiles are to you then why did you kill my friend i queried earnestly
why have you held these two white people with you
your friend is unhurt physically but mentally he now belongs to jupiter
his intentions were doubtful when he leaped up here beside eloli whom your feeble mind refers to as allie lane
i should have killed him instantly felt unable to think of anything for a moment and i stared fascinated at the features that confronted me
i noticed that the colors in the chamber were changing again and that the lackadaisical visage of abaris was growing more pronounced under the varying hues
his saucerlike eyelids continued their resounding like the sound of shutters closing on a camera donot believe you abaris my voice suddenly raised
you killed him because you knew that he was allie man by all the laws of humanity ion this world care we jovians for the laws of your humanity abaris thought wave struck me sharply could have killed you both instantly
you were trespassing on forbidden ground and i therefore had the right to remove you from it did you know we were here i asked sentinels on the surface informed us of your coming long before you reached here
we had no intention of harming you unless you entered the crater thats why you hung up these skeletons out there to scare us away eh
i inquired
did you think a few grinning skulls would make us run the skeleton of anything on this earth tends to frighten away the living
abaris declared nonchalantly
even a dog will run from the bones of its kind why not you who are just a step higher intellectually than the dog a bragging cuss arenot you abaris
i shot back with contempt and sarcasm been misinformed as to the status of the human race on this world i could think up a better way to frighten a man than that of jupiter have many ways to frighten a man if you like to call yourself such
but you see we are not particularly interested in whether we frighten or not
you and your friend and these two humans beside me are the first to have come here since we arrived from jupiter
we felt no need of methods to frighten others away
they disappear lord
i thought had these creatures come to this world from another planet at a time when we on this world were crossing the country in oxdrawn wagon trains
had they arrived here before allie lane and her father wandered into the manalava plain
yes man of the earth abaris mental wave reached me in answer to my thoughts
we dropped down from jupiter long before your people began crossing your continent
we have been here exactly one hundred of your years and we are now ready to return to jupiter if that interests you
our work here is completed
we return soon to our own world four hundred million miles away
four hundred million miles my mind whirled with staggering figures and i gave it up can understand your mathematical deductions abaris i said but just the same from missouri and you have to prove to me that you covered all that space just to visit this world
it is hard to believe that any living thing can exist long enough to do it
it donot sound possible one of the failings of you men of the earth abaris said evenly
you think that everything that does not come within your scope of understanding is impossible
we of jupiter long ago achieved immortality
but why should abaris second in command of the great jupiter explain to a lowly creature such as you the vastly important facts of interplanetary travel
you could tell me so i might inform my fellows on this earth that it was actually performed
otherwise have to call you a liar i said with a false show of bravado
so far no harm had come to me and abaris had informed me that sands suffered no permanent physical injury
i could afford to hold up my chin and meet on equal terms with the grotesque frogmen of jupiter
what were they anyhow but unreal mechanical freaks
well to tell the truth your world will never learn the secret from a jovian man of the earth abaris thought vibrations seemed to say might say that some day your scientists may evolve a medium for interplanetary travel and we of jupiter do not intend to shorten the period of time when you will eventually try to visit us
you will not be welcome giving us a lot more credit than you have been saying was due us abaris i remarked with a grin glad you have come around to to that
it makes me feel better to know that a little more intelligent than a crawling worm
suddenly the chamber brightened under the brilliance of powerful rays
small spheres spinning rapidly and glowing luminously shot restlessly to and fro in the far end of the chamber
at the sound they made i instinctively turne to them for several seconds
when my eyes again returned to abaris and his two human companions they were gone they had vanished apparently in thin air during the few short seconds my eyes had wandered around the brilliantly lighted chamber
save for an inert heap lying on the throne in the same position that i had seen sands when he had fallen the chamber was completely deserted
the spheres continued their back and forth movement as i dashed quickly to sands side
at the close range i discovered that his body was tinged with the same luminous glow that i had seen outlining the bodies of abaris allie lane and her father
sands seemed stunned
he was breathing but his lungs functioned laboriously
sands i cried shaking him by the shoulder
are you hurt
from his lips issued a deep groan
i swung his inert body around for a look at his face
the color of it was a deeper green than it had been before
i stretched him out flat on his back and rubbed his numbed hands to restore his circulation but it availed me nothing
then i remembered that on my desert prospects i always carried a square lump of camphor in my pockets to rub on my lips when they became parched from the heat
i searched through my pockets for it and was overjoyed when i found it
it was soft and spongy
quickly i massaged sands lips and nostrils
whether camphor would serve in the place of the more powerful spirits of ammonia i did not know but you can imagine my joy when his lids suddenly fluttered and his lips parted
the camphor fumes had actually brought him out of the faint into which the powerful rays from abaris deadly weapon had thrown him laughed nervously it old timer
i said snap out of it
the devil said he didnot hurt you got to get allie and her father out of here
these freaks are planning to get away from here in a hurry taking allie and her dad with them
sit still and take it easy for a minute sands sat very still for several minutes his head resting in his hands
i squatted on the floor of the platform beside him my eyes scouring every side of the circular chamber
to the right the entrance into the chamber through which had come allie lane her father and abaris stood open
the huge circular rock which must have weighed many tons had not been replaced over the opening
the most conspicuous thing in the entire chamber was the fairsized globe in the center resting on an axis and revolving rapidly
from the distance i could see that it was lined with many crisscross markings and glowed as though containing a transparent liquid of a beautiful emerald color much similar to colored glass globes gener350 all displayed in drug store windows in the city
occasionally the brilliant spheres that hung spinning in midair darted suddenly toward the larger globe in the center
when one of the smaller spheres neared it the central ball emitted a peculiar highpitched hum
the globes combined with the darting lights gave me the impression that they must be used by the jovians for some astronomical purpose
the big sphere i thought must represent the home planet of the grotesque beings
what else could they be used for i wondered but i was due to learn much before i got out of there
sands recovers sands stood erect
he lookr ed around him for several seconds evidently to get his bearings
i watched him nervously
what had abaris meant when he said that mentally sands belonged to jupiter
i knew when i looked into sands eyes
like fathomless abysses his eyes glowed like sulphurous fires
the pupils had grown until they seemed to disappear into the rim entirely
he seemed to be in the same trance that had held allie and her fathers eyes staring straight ahead without apparently comprehensive powers
held in the embrace of the strange hypnotism that had probably forced allie and her father to do the slightest bidding of the froglike creatures sands truly belonged to jupiter
at once i resigned myself to whatever fate might be in store for me for i could not hope for any cooperation from sands
when i spoke to him he merely stared blankly although i was certain that he understood my words
his lips moved to answer but no words formed in his throat
he seemed to have been stricken dumb
suddenly i began an attempt to converse with him through the strange mental telepathy of the jovians but try as i might i received no response
he was a doomed man unless abaris would restore him to his normal self shook him by the arm think i said to him pointing to the opening from which abaris had come into the chamber and into which he had doubtless vanished that we had better find allie lane and her father if we hope to get out of here alive
you know that shes here and alive donot you sands to me it appeared that he made an attempt to speak when he heard name mentioned but he merely stared dumbly
at any rate i believed he understood what i had said nudged him and he trembled under the touch we can get to allie and her father without these critters knowing it i whispered into his ear she might be able to point a way out of here
if we can get out strike toward stovepipe wells and send a telegram to los angeles asking for help afraid well need a couple of bombing planes from san pedro to get us out of this mess grabbed him by the arm and hustled him toward the circular shaft leading from the chamber
he came readily enough but when i loosened the pressure on his arm he stood there stock still
he seemed to have no will power whatever and his legs moved only because i hustled him along
perhaps the grip of the strange influence that held him would soon vanish i thought
but for the present he remained in its embrace physically and mentally
as we entered the only open shaft leading out of the chamber a highpitched musical note became audible
i wondered if our movements had sounded some mysterious warning
as we continued on into the luminous tunnel that glittered with deposits of priceless gems the musical note rose higher and higher so that it seemed to tax the sense of hearing to its uttermost
questioningly i turned to sands
one of his trembling hands was chafing his temples with thumb and forefinger
the sound gradually became a wail ilke the metallic scream we had heard before entering the cave that led down to the chamber
suddenly i became aware that sands had broken the influence that had held him
with a frenzied scream he leaped aside and away from me
i gazed in wonder at the man as he crouched like a beast at bay
i expected him momentarily to spring at my throat
but he finally recognized me and became controlled when i assured him the jovians were not in sight
his first questions were of allie lane
had he really seen her he wanted to know or had he been suffering from a brain fever
was she really alive as beautiful as ever
i assured him that she was
lord he gasped shuddering
that noise would drive a man insane
yes i whispered softly but you ought to thank it for bringing you to your senses i believed the shrill sounds were actually responsible for his recovery do you mean he asked blankly you know that the big chief of these freaks bounced you for jumping onto the platform donot remember anything but that seen or dreamed seen allie lane alive he said disconsolately
well i explained the high chief who calls himself by the name of abaris didnot like the idea of you getting familiar with allie and he knocked you out cold
i thought he killed you and he might have at that had he wanted to
i thought you were a goner got a hell of a nerve then he exploded his face twitching in terrible rage that under the glow of green made him almost as grotesque as abaris himself loved allie lane all my life and now that found her nothing but death will stop me from having her havenot found her yet sands i reminded him softly somewhere down this tunnel
i think we ought to get to her as soon as we can
those devils are going to leave here probably take allie with him do they think they can get away so quick he inquired donot know that yet i said
but well soon find out
for perhaps several hundred feet we picked our way hugging the gemstudded walls along the tunnel though which allie lane had entered the chamber
overhead small balls of light flitted occasionally illuminating the entire passageway
we encountered several smaller passageways branching off from the main shaft but we continued along the wider thoroughfare
what had become of the jovians
i wondered as we slowly edged our way along the wall
the only thing that seemed to mark their existence in the great underground maze of tunnel and caverns deep below death valley was the persistent highpitched musical notes that smashed into the eardrums with an unending viciousness
the underground search our footsteps led us into another circular chamber somewhat larger than the one into which abaris had come
this great room was illuminated by darting lights which exposed units of rapidly revolving machinery from which emanated the highpitched musical notes
i motioned sands to halt until we studied the apparatus
in our appraisal of the machinery we saw what appeared to be perhaps a half dozen cylindrical tubes that stood upright spinning rapidly
over each glowed a pale green luminosity
the bases of the cylinders went through the hard rock floor of the chamber and their spinning movement created a terrific suction for the air in the cavern was swirling
attached to each of the cylinders were hundreds of small tubes that gave off a deep green ray for their entire length
one tube ran from the cylinders to a central manifold to which was attached a larger tube that fairly sputtered and glowed under a force similar to but more powerful than a great vacuum tube
audible even above the noise that was created by the rapid whirl of the peculiar machines came the steady rhythmic throb of centrifugal pumps
the throb was the same sound that we had heard while we stood for the first time on the rim overlooking the crater containing the radium pool
lights floated above the spinning machinery
they made little bright spots in the luminous green that formed the drafty atmosphere like lanterns being swung rapidly in a murky fog
i turned to sands who was standing just behind me staring over my shoulder intently watching the motion of the machinery and the darting lights beginning to believe abaris now i whispered in his ear
these devils are actually draining this world of an unknown radium deposit
all this machinery the spheres and lights must be operated by radium power of intensity that is not possessed in the small quantities that we have found so far that might be so pardner sands placed his lips close to my ear but interested in allie lane nothing else find her gave him an assuring nudge and we edged our way along the wall of the circular chamber maintaining a safe distance from the whirling machinery for it seemed possessed with a powerful magnetism
i would like to have studied it closer but something seemed to warn me to remain a safe distance away from whirling cylinders which spun like electrical generators with the tubes connected like generating brushes
i might be drawn into the whirling things and be sucked to death was still awed over the sudden disappearance of the jovians and felt that their absence spelled some sinister disaster to us
i momentarily expected some of them to appear and seize us
with an effort i cast off the feeling and we continued along the chamber wall
suddenly we came to an exit shaft just high enough to admit a jovian without bending
i raised an arm to estimate the height of the ceiling
my fingertips just scraped it
the tunnel was in total darkness and this appeared to be the only exit from the chamber with the exception of the one through which we had entered
we clung hand in hand as we went into it
we had not gone more than a dozen steps until we were enveloped in an inky blackness
certainly i thought the jovians must be aware through their peculiar mental telepathy that we were exploring their secret chambers
why didnot they swoop down upon us and challenge our progress
perhaps i thought they did not figure it worthwhile believing that we would eventually lose ourselves in the network of underground vistas tunnels and chambers and die as the result
it was a grim outlook for both of us at best but i had one thing the assurance of abaris himself that the jovians had no intention of harming us seriously
on the other hand neither would they go out of their way to aid us
that was certain eventually we became somewhat accustomed to the inky blackness of the tunnel and we were able to make out the forms of each other
staring straight ahead i discovered what i accepted to be a small circular hole through which came a faint luminosity
we made for it as rapidly as we could although we were extremely cautious and fearful lest we step into one of the bottomless abysses which i felt existed in the underground world
we edged our way along the tunnel for perhaps a quarter of a mile before we eventually came to the circular light which we had seen
i was not surprised when we found that it was an en352 trance or an exit of another chamber
we approached it carefully not knowing what might lie ahead
we had no intention of exposing ourselves to the ire of abaris could we help it
we wanted to find allie lane and her father now that he too was alive
i crawled on hands and knees to the tunnel outlet
sands was on the opposite side of the hole
we peered intently into the chamber which was brilliantly lighted
the white brightness of the light gave me an impression that it emanated from the sun it blinded us temporarily
the chamber was decorated gorgeously in purple and gold drapes that hung suspended from the rooms walls
massive metal chairs like the three on the platform back in the first chamber stood in artistic positions
on one side of the wall draped with a yellow cloth of metal that glistened like fire in the brilliant light hung a great sheet of glasslike material that mirrored other objects in the chamber
under it stood a golden dressing table at which was a frail silver bench
truly i thought as i surveyed the mirror vanity and bench these objects could be of no use to anyone except a beautiful woman the thought gave birth to another idea
perhaps this was the room to which allie lane had been confined
my eyes wandered to the far end of the chamber
to my surprise there stood near the wall a massive couch that seemed to have been hewn from a great emerald block
its coverings were of a soft silken material edged with gold as i stared at the beautiful piece my eyes detected a slight movement of the coverings
i looked on the couch awestruck
reunion before our very eyes and apparently alone lay allie lane on the silken covered emerald couch
from underneath her brilliant robes protruded a dainty foot and ankle
her face lay buried in her arms and her body wracked with silent sobs her brown hair shimmering in the glare of the light
i looked at sands across the tunnel outlet
he stared intently at the reclining figure his mouth agape
he allowed a hand to run nervously across his brow as though to gain assurance that his eyes were not playing him false
then i made a careful scrutiny of the chamber to make certain that allie was alone
sands i hissed in low undertones that could not have been heard beyond the few feet that separated us your chance allie lane on that couch sobbing for you
go to her partner stay here and watch
sands looked at me for an instant then taking my hand he squeezed it until my fingers ached
thanks pard was all he said but his eyes showed what words would fail to tell
releasing his grip on my hand he stepped softly into the chamber and strode lightly with a buoyant step toward the silken couch
a lump rose in my throat as i watched him moving swiftly toward the girl he had gone through hell to find
few men would have remained loyal as he to this slip of a girl and hunted in every nook of california for more than forty long weary years it was his great love for her in the first place his beautiful sense of loyalty that had caused me to join him in the last few years of his search
now he was at her side
allie
allie his voice softly appealing came to me where i squatted silently guarding the chamber
my eyes wandered around the room nothing escaping them
again came sands appealing call
i looked at him as he stood beside the couch arms outstretched
the girl lay perfectly still now and her face remained buried in her arms as though fearful to look up
slowly her head turned
from where i squatted i could see her profile as it turned towards sands tears like pearls streaming down her cheek
i expected to see again her sweet features staring mutely blank as they were before me when i first beheld her
suddenly the girl sat upright and turned her face up to sands
her eyes widened in amazement and fright
i watched her closely temporarily forgetting my own sworn duty to stand guard over the chamber
would she recognize her lover of forty years ago i wondered if she really would
or was she still under the spell of some strange jovian trance
my blood pounded at my temples in those few seconds of uncertainty
i could imagine her amazement at seeing sands but i could not comprehend her delay in flying to his embrace if she still loved him
she sat very still staring up into sands luminous green features with their months growth of beard
perhaps his radium affliction and his beard had puzzled her i thought
that was true
she did not recognize him immediately as the result
for long minutes she stared at him through glistening tears
then with a soft cry allie lane literally flew into his arms
sands squeezed her close to him his face buried in her tumbled brown hair
a feeling of exultation and of triumph surged through my whole body and i slapped my thigh with joy
i was immensely happy
but my joy was short lived
i always was more or less of a crank and my happiness soon fled before a cloud of gloom that formed sinister thoughts in my brain
now that sands and allie lane were together again how were they to escape from the underground outpost of jupiter
if we did succeed in finding our way out of the maze of tunnels how did we expect to traverse death valley without water
it was impossible
better had we all remain hidden far below death burning surface than to expose ourselves to the sinister power of abaris or the terrible fatal heat of the surface meanwhile my attention was drawn again to the two lovers as they stood beside the silken couch
allie nestled close to the broad powerful chest of her sweetheart and spoke to him in a low musical voice
quickly i glanced around the room trying not to listen to them
i had already a violent feeling of being an intruder on their reunion
oh robert her voice tense with both fright and joy
how did you ever find me why did you risk your life to come here in the midst of these terrible creatures so afraid love you sands whispered affectionately love you better than life itself searched for you for many years and i would have continued searching until i could no longer crawl at last i have found you allie and i shall never leave you again why robert she suddenly exclaimed
you havenot searched for me for many years
you couldnot have because you are just the same bob sands you were when you started to california
why did you let those terrible whiskers grow
i donot like them
allie emitted a little musical laugh then continued
you must shave those horrible whiskers off at once you know allie dear that you have been lost from me for over forty years forgotten just exactly how many years been searching so long that lost track of time
sands whispered softly looking into her expressive eyes
a smile played at the corners of her lips
you are fooling robert she said searching his face for proof of jest
it just couldnot be
why robert be an old woman now if it were true be almost sixty
lord
i gasped to myself as i stood guard over the chamber and this secret love tryst between allie lane and driftin sands she know that shes been lost to the world for over forty years
poor girl
sands oughtnot to tell her then again it might be best for her to know everything listened intently for now i wanted to learn any information that allie might give to sands regarding the grotesque jovians and their plans
the information might aid us materially in finding ways and means of escaping them
how to escape was crying softly hard to believe you robert i know that you wouldnot lie to me but it does seem impossible
why just the same as i was when you left me back in kansas city i donot seem to have grown older
let me look at myself please dear
allie walked with faltering steps over to the huge mirror hanging on the wall and stared into it her hands wandering softly over her features
sands walked to her side and peered into the radium reflector
the reflection he witnessed there caused him to leap aside
for the first time he saw his face since the radioactive qualities of the radium had restored his youth
here he was in reality an old man who had been suddenly returned to youth
and instead of seeing the visage of a wrinkled and weatherbeaten old man he beheld the features of robert sands as they were when he arrived in california forty years before
his was a surprise beyond description of words
he ran a hand over his face incredulously
taking this opportunity to attract his attention i whistled softly
he looked up with a jerk and patting allie lightly on the shoulder he came to the entrance of the tunnel where i squatted
allie was staring into the mirror incredulously as though unable to believe that under ordinary circumstances she would be in the autumn of life on this earth that the beautiful face in the mirror would long ago have become wrinkled and shrunken we better get father and try to get out of here sands
i asked him
those devils might show up any minute plum forgot about you pardner he said apologetically forgot about everything
have you any idea how were going to get out of here
i havenot
maybe allie knows of some way ask her yes ask her now i advised now or never with that he walked back to allie
at the scraping sound of his boots she turned to him smiling joyously dear i heard him whisper brought a friend of mine here standing guard to warn us if anyone comes got him in this terrible predicament and i want to get him out get you and all of us out of here
you want to go with me back to civilization donot you dear will go anywhere with you robert she said placing her hands on his chest endearingly
then dear can you tell me how to lead us out know of only one way to get out of here robert she whispered but abaris has guards there constantly afraid we could not get through them
you neednot be afraid of abaris bob dear
he has been very kind to me and daddy
humph
sands snorted curtly
he has not been so nice to me like to blast him to hell
he knocked me cold when i first saw you allie out there on the throne saw me there robert she asked
and abaris harmed you when you came near me did allie
knocked me plumb out and nearly killed me brute she said angrily
well maybe well find a way out of here robert
let me call father in the room next to me
wait here sands returned to the tunnel and squatted in the semidarkness beside me
he was breathing hard with excitement and there was a twinkle of joy and anticipation that formed crows feet at the sides of his eyes
he seemed suddenly a very joyous man and forgetful of the sinister danger that hovered over all of us
what would happen i wondered if abaris suddenly came upon the secret love tryst of sands and his sweetheart
would he fly into a sudden rage and destroy us with his terrible invisible weapon that shot green pencilthin rays and killed instantly
we sat silently sands with his thoughts of love and happiness i with thoughts of danger and death
presently we heard a sound like the scraping of feet
sands and i shrank close to the tunnels wall in the semidarkness
our fears fled however when allie came into the chamber followed by her father
lane appeared at close range to be a man of about forty
his hair was black and his eyes were gray and penetrating
his carriage was that of a man in his prime of life full of power and vigor and his eyes flashed as they searched room nervously
sands got to his feet and walked slowly into the lighted chamber
lane stopped abruptly and surveyed him with an incredulous stare
suddenly he stepped swiftly to sands side their hands met firmly given up all hope of ever seeing you again bob he said in a clear voice that tingled with excitement
it is indeed a pleasure to have you with us again sure allie is glad
thanks mr lane sands returned been a long time but struggled hard for this meeting faired well under conditions you and allie but weve got to get away from these frogfaced freaks here
tell me what you know about a way out and well start at once
just like you bob lane said admiringly
you always did want to be the first to get started sit down and talk it over terribly afraid that well find it hard to get out however gone through a lot sands whispered little more wouldnot amount to much
maybe not bob lane interjected with a frown
but this is one time when you do not know what you are up against
as much as like to get back home to my friends i canot see any definite way to escape
but cooperate to the fullest for yours and sake
the three of them walked softly to silken couch and sat down allie close to sands his arms about her waist
i heard a faint sound issuing from the tunnel that led from chamber
i held my breath in fear
was abaris or some of his jovians coming upon the scene
my blood pounded as i listened with my hands cupped behind my ears to magnify any sound
no more sounds came and i breathed easier
i turned again to the three in room
lane was speaking his voice in muffled tones reached me explained to me how you came to be here
bob he was saying so we wonot recount it again
these strange people here claim they are from the planet jupiter and came here solely for the purpose of obtaining a great supply of radium
it seems that they have exhausted the supply on their own planet
through delicate instruments abaris says their scientists discovered that this earth contained a great deposit of the metal
they henceforth set out to get it because life on their planet depends upon it for existence
if abaris fails it means that perhaps the entire population bf jupiter will be wiped out unless some other heavenly body is found to contain a deposit the devil did they ever get here
sands asked interestedly
story coming to that now bob lane continued softly
it sounds quite impossible but it is a fact that abaris and his henchmen left jupiter in a great spherical machine similar to some of the spheres that you probably saw on your way in here
this sphere which is capable of interstellar travel propelled by a radium process known only to their mechanics is ready at this minute to return to jupiter with the greater stock of that metal
for a long time they have been pumping radium out of the earth and sending it to jupiter in small spheres which are controlled and guided by an unknown source of power
abaris says that the deposit here is about exhausted and the cylinder pumps are bringing up the last drops of radium existing in this earth
abaris expects to halt the pumps very soon and enter the interplanetary sphere for departure to jupiter
he has said that we were to accompany him to his planet nd being unable to escape allie and i have resigned ourselves to whatever fate is in store for us
i must admit that abaris has been very good to us and while we would certainly like to get back to our people i hold no animosity against him except of course that his appearance as are all the rest of his kind is horrifying to us
but we have become adapted to the environment yet we must naturally rebel against being spirited away from this glorious world of ours to perhaps be regarded on jupiter much in the same manner as we have looked upon strange animals here sometime i have suspected that abaris in his grotesque way is exceptionally fond of allie
she has wanted for nothing
her every wish has been granted but he will not consent to our appearing before the multitude unless we submit to being placed under a strange power
in other words we are forced to undergo hypnotism for a reason that i have not been able to learn
that is why we did not see you when you stood before the platform in the throne chamber
allie told you there is one exit from this underground world and that is guarded constantly either by the jovians themselves or their grotesque deathdealing mechanical guards in the shape of a cactus tree with arms like an octopus
the mechanical jovians seem to have all the powers of the creatures themselves lacking only their mental faculties
unless controlled by a living hand they are helpless
these jovians are really geniuses in all forms
you have seen the series of spheres in the throne room with the large hall in the center
the large sphere is jupiter in a miniature orbit
the small spheres are its moons as good abaris explained to us
through these they are able to watch the progress of their radium spheres as they shoot their way toward jupiter
the large spheres show their passage very plainly
but these explanations of jovian objects and scientific genius are not getting us to our goal
so let us consider the possibility of escape
i have a plan that we may be able to use listened intently to the plan of possible action as lane outlined it to sands father explained that at a certain time the guards at the only avenue of escape would be changed and the mechanical jovians with their tentaclelike arms controlled by a remote central would be put in their places
lane explained how he had previously located the source of control over the mechanical men and was therefore perhaps in the position to disconnect the controlling system and suspend their activity
this sounded like a very excellent plan but how i thought would it be possible for us to steal near the central control apparatus in our attempt to disconnect it
surely the jovians must maintain a constant guard over such delicate and important apparatus
but on the other hand they may not feel a need of it in view of the fact that allie lane and her father had been with them so long that they accepted them as being harmless
at any rate sands approved of the plan and it was decided that the attempt to escape would be made at a time when lane was to give a low whistle and we would all meet in chamber providing of course that the way was clear
lane with his forefinger drew an invisible outline showing the tunnel through which we were to go
sands watched him closely and absorbed the information
meanwhile i shot rapid glances around the chamber in its entirety in my part as guard
several times my heart jumped when i heard sounds that softly broke the stillness of the cavern but the sounds failed to bring what i expected the grotesque jovians
sands was standing in the center of the room now allie lane in his arms
they kissed endearingly father paced the floor nervously
suddenly lane stopped pacing and faced his daughter and her lover
he opened his lips to say something thought better of it then turned half away
he swung around presently as though he had decided on some question confronting him and spoke softly
allie his words nervous and tense reached me
you love
bob donot you dear
as well as life father she answered
sands turned to look at lane puzzled
suppose then lane returned that you marry bob now
it would be a good thing in the face of whatever confronts us would marry him now father allie said in a half whisper that i barely caught
but how
you forget my dear that i was a minister back in kansas city her father smiled waited a long time allie sands put in holding shoulder and looking into her eyes lovingly
then i will marry you at once robert she said her eyes shining with happy tears
father can perform the ceremony
caught
i watched the procedure that followed forgetting my duty as guard in whose hands must rest the lives of the happy three
with my eyes and attention on allie as she whispered do i failed to notice that abaris had suddenly come to the entrance of the chamber and was standing there silently regarding the trio
lane was saying now pronounce you man and wife when i beheld abaris towering form as he stood menacingly just inside the room
the tubes of his forehead stuck out rigidly his tentaclelike arms twitching in anger and his owlish eyes opened and closed rapidly
i shrank back into the darkness of the tunnel fearful lest i be discovered
from my hiding place however i could see the entire chamber
as though struck by some terrific force sands and lane at once spun around and faced abaris
allie emitted a fearful little cry and shrank back against the wall
abaris tubes were pointed at them menacingly and i knew that he was speaking to them in his peculiar mental telepathy
what words flew between them i was not able to catch for i had learned that i could not receive the wave vibrations unless the tubes were pointing directly at me
suddenly i heard sands words as he angrily informed abaris that allie had just become his wife and that it was no mans business what he was doing in the chamber with her
his features twitched with growing anger as he spoke his hands were clenched
you frogface
i heard him shout searched for allie lane for forty years
now that i have found her and she has become my wife you nor anyone else can take her away from me alive eloli is the bride of jupiter man of the earth i caught the thunderous vibrations from abaris tubes which now waved spasmodically in all directions
his thoughts were so powerful that they carried to me where i crouched
allie lane is my wife cried sands hotly
we die before she goes with you to your planet of crazy freaks yes abaris lane put in weakly shaking as one palsied
allie is this mans wife
you cannot take her away from him
if is the law of humanity
abaris froglike beak opened and then closed with a resounding snap
i expected him momentarily to bring into play his terrible invisible ray of death
his skinny tubelike legs held up his barrelshaped body admirably i thought as i watched him from my hiding place
they seemed like stilts unjointed except at the hips around which was draped a narrow breech cloth of goldedged purple
his body glistened oilily and around his bald misshapen head rested a thin metal band glowing luminously green
his antennae tubes waved angrily goes with abaris to jupiter abaris thundered his vibrations reaching me sharply
i shuddered under the force of his powerful thought waves
on jupiter we have specimens of many planetarial beings
our scientists would like to study specimens of the aborigines of this planet
therefore the three of you will accompany me to jupiter
eloli comes as the bride of jove would die there abaris lane parried dejectedly
we of this earth could not adapt ourselves to your environment do not seem to understand man of the earth abaris vibrations said that we of jupiter have accomplished immortality
there is no death on jupiter
will you come voluntarily or shall i be forced to resort to other methods
from where i lay hidden in terror i watched sands face
in his anger his features twisted with fury
i could not help him should he attempt to attack the huge jovian commander who stood before him
if i only could how gladly i would have gone into the chamber
suddenly i heard a dismal hooting from somewhere behind abaris that gradually grew nearer
i watched the opening of the tunnel behind him expecting momentarily to see his followers enter the room
two abreast they came their bodies shining with freshly applied oil their loins covered with shimmering breechcloths
unlike abaris they wore no bands around their huge heads
like soldiers their line broke in the center where abaris huge body stood like a pivot and they singlefiled around the walls of the circular chamber shot a quick glance at sands
he stood belligerently watching
allie had crept into his arms and buried her head against his bosom
lane stared down at the floor downcast and utterly dejected
when i first beheld lane i was impressed with his flashing eyes and strong powerful body and had figured upon his cooperation at such a dire moment as this
but perhaps i thought he realized unlike sands and myself the utter futility of objecting to the demands of the jovians
but sands was of a different mettle
slowly he moved allie behind him and again faced abaris
the jovians lined around the chamber wall stood apparently at attention
they made no move to interfere
had abaris ordered them to remain inactive relying upon his own power of combat to force the three humans into submission
sands shouted insultingly at abaris
you call off your dogs and well settle this right now not afraid of your crazy lights and even if i was rather die than submit to you abaris throat cackled with his peculiar laugh
his owlish eyes stared through unblinking lids
sands approached him with sinister steadiness crouched ready to spring at the bulllike throat of the giant
i stared at him fearfully
here was the end i thought as abaris tilted his huge head to look down upon his insignificant antagonist
i glanced around the chamber at the froggish jovians
they continued to stand silently at attention
the struggle a watched the unfolding 5f the terrible scene in the chamber i found myself wondering what i would do if sands actually attempted to fight his way through the deathdealing rays of the jovians
my hand accidentally touched my gun butt and for the first time since i had used the weapon back in the first tunnel i remembered that i still possessed it
i felt somewhat heartened at the reassuring touch but how useless it was in fighting the grotesque frogmen from the distant world surely it could not kill or disable them for hadnot i thumbed a slug into the bony features of one of them
that slug would have killed a man instantly but the jovian had no more than croaked as the lead tore through his head patted the gun affectionately and inspected the cylinder
reloading i snapped it back into its holster with a grim determination that i would use it
better had allie lane her father and driftin sands rest in peace on this earth than in mortal terror forever on jupiter i thought
suddenly my eyes were brought back to the chamber by a curdling scream
allie had fainted as sands sprang at the bulllike throat of abaris upsetting him in the suddenness of his attack
lane stood petrified allie lay unmolested and unaided upon the floor
just inside the chamber near the entrance sands and abaris seemed locked in a terrible embrace of death
chest to chest they lay on the floor
sands on top holding in his powerful hands the thin rubberlike arms of the hideous bestialvisaged ruler of the jovians
sands grunted as he strained hard to hold abaris flexible arms to prevent him from bringing into play the terrible weapon that seemed to be concealed in the suckerlike tips at their ends
it seemed like the conflict of two great forces man and beast in a terrible battle for supremacy like good and evil angel and demon
i was thrilled at the great heroism of sands and my heart swelled with the pride of having his loyal friendship
slowly i edged my way toward the chamber keeping well against the wall for a closer view of the struggle
as uneven as it seemed sands i thought was the better of the two physically
but how could he hope to win such an unequal combat unarmed and against the terrible green death rays of abaris
white man and planetarial beast
no greater contrast could be imagined
the muscles in sands neck bulged as he labored to hold the tough flexible arms of abaris
the skinny legs unjointed and stiltlike kicked spasmodically poor protection against sands powerful limbs
from a better point of vantage i watched the struggle
which of the two would win the terrible battle of physical forces
suddenly abaris gave a great heave that cast sands clear from his barrellike body
but sands held with bull dog tenacity onto the writhing arms of the jovian leader struggling vainly to prevent abaris from aiming his pencilthin emerald rays of destruction
once abaris shot his terrible ray and a jovian near him vanished entirely in a puff of acrid smoke a ray struck one of the huge chairs and it crumbled
this combat i felt would be more like a wrestling match due to the fact that it seemed impossible for abaris to rise on his stiltlike legs
that much in favor of sands but what would happen to him if abaris succeeded in striking him with a green ray shot with uncontrollable anger studied abaris bestial features to see how he was accepting the terrific throttling he was receiving
his owlish orbs gleamed flaming red and stared bestially into sands set features his terrible power of will burning into the mans brain
i cast a quick glance at allie
she was just recovering from her faint and her father was at her side
from behind fluttering lids allie looked at the struggling figures thrashing about on the chamber floor
she groaned softly and hid her face sobbing
watching them my muscles involuntarily became tense
my breath came in gasps born of sheer sympathy for sands and his long lost sweetheart
slowly very slowly the dominating will power of abaris overcame the struggling physical force of sands
gradually he eased his terrible grip on the writhing arms and steadily abaris was bringing their suckerlike tips toward his antagonist
realizing his waning strength sands made a desperate effort to tear his eyes from the blazing relentless orbs of abaris turning his head to the side
but struggle as he would with all the physical strength at his command he could not check the gradual domination of brainpower and will that was slowly but surely smothering him to submission
presently sands muscles relaxed and finally the terrific power of abaris dominating will swept into the core of his brain overpowering him
i cursed softly and hid my face in my hands for a second head dropped to one side his powerful arms hung limply
blood streamed from his nostrils caused by his tremendous physical efforts
i caught a glimpse of his eyes as his head fell
they were stark unseeing eyes his body shuddered convulsively as it slipped inertly to the chamber floor
abaris was hoisted erect by two of his jovians his tubes waving victoriously a cackling laugh in his throat
allie lane screamed and her father stroked her shaking head gently as abaris strode wobbling like a duck toward them
i looked at sands
his breathing was heavy and irregular
abaris i thought had not killed him outright nor had he brought into play his terrible rays
his great mental power alone had completely subdued him
slowly my hand stole to the butt of my gun
with a jerk i snapped the weapon out of its holster holding back the hammer with my thumb
in a space of several seconds i could have hurled five slugs at allie and her father and the inert form of sands
the sixth i had planned was to crash through my own brain
i levelled the gun at temple exposed through a wisp of her soft brown hair but i could not find the heart tq release my thumb from the hammer
suddenly i felt a wave of great remorse surge deep within me for not sending a half dozen shot into the owlish eyes of abaris
why hadn i shot him as he lay there on the ground struggling under sands and clipped the writhing arms from his body
was i actually the kind of a coward who would stand by hiding like a frightened jackrabbit while the life was being crushed out of my dearest and most loyal friends
alone a rage filled me
what would my wife think of me back at balch if she learned that i had stood idly by like a whipped cur and permitted those uncouth freaks to commit a wrong against allie and her lover
how could my children ever live down the cowardice of their father it was with these thoughts in my maddened brain that i suddenly dashed out of the tunnel gun in hand and blocked abatis passage toward allie and her father
i felt a terrible urge to kill to spill the blood or whatever it was that coursed through the veins of the frogfaced beasts stop abaris i shouted hysterically
stop where you are kill you if you move he stared at me through flaming owlish orbs
his froglike mouth opened and there came from his cavernous throat the mocking cackling laugh
it was maddening his cackling indifference suddenly remembering that it was within the power of these strange creatures to render my weapon useless causing it to heat and burn my hand i lifted the barrel from my hip and let fly
swiftly and with the flaming desire to kill pounding at my brain i thumbed the hammer of my gun in a row six round green holes appeared just above abaris flaming eyes he tottered for an instant and then recovered himself
an emerald green liquid poured from the holes and ran down into his owlish eyes
so rapidly were the slugs hurled from my gun that the jovians did not instantly grasp their significance
then abruptly the entire chamber seemed alive with thin green rays that played with deadly precision around me
abaris suddenly ill from the effect of the six slugs passing through his head made a weak attempt to lift a tentaclelike arm
it was with an effort that he brought it up
i made a leap at him but i was too late
a ray shot from the tip of his fiendish arm i felt a tingle on my left side just over the heart
the chamber floor seemed to rush up as i fell heavily
for several seconds i lay there in full command of my faculties but unable to move a muscle
my head swam and i had a feeling that i was being hurled through space at a terrific speed
then a terrible blackness overcame me and i seemed to be falling into a yawning abyss
how long i lay there i do not know
for ages it seemed i lay on my back making no attempt to move but staring into an inky blackness overhead
what had caused the chamber to become dark i wondered
were my eyes really open
i pinched myself
i was not dead after all
i listened attentively for some sound to indicate the presence of someone
i heard nothing
the silence was awful
then i wondered if i had succeeded in killing abaris
if so he should be lying at my feet
with an effort i wiggled a leg in an attempt to feel the floor near it
perhaps abaris had crawled away or his men had removed him from the room i thought
then i remembered the futility of trying to kill a jovian felt no pain although the blood pounded at my temples and i felt terribly weak and nauseated
my left side seemed numb deadened where abaris ray had struck
presently as i lay in the darkness my ears caught a low moaning sound
increasing in volume the sound soon became a highpitched wail like that which we had heard when we beheld the sphere whirling on the column in the center of the radium pool
my ear drums pounded under the force of the shriek and i placed my hands over them to shut out the maddening sound
suddenly the whole earth seemed to tremble a rumble filled the room as though the world were in the tumultuous throes of some great upheaval
with an ominous roar the floor under me shuddered and cracked
i lay panicstricken thinking that a terrible earthquake had swept over the valley of death
crashing earthslides roared around me as i lay helpless
overhead i could see a thin streak of light penetrating through a fissure that was slowly widening the chamber was becoming brighter under the glare of light that entered it from the fissure
i stood upon my feet and braced myself to keep from falling under the swaying movements of the earth
i looked around quickly
the chamber was entirely vacant
not a sign remained of abaris his jovians allie or any of them they were gone
at my feet i noticed a spreading pool of green liquid
i cursed abaris and his hideous followers roundly
presently as i stood staring down at the liquid that must have poured from the wounds i had inflicted upon abaris i heard a terrific roar coming from somewhere near
the floor of the chamber rolled like the surface of an angry sea
i was dashed against the wall where i lay
i expected momentarily to see the chamber close up and crush me to death sealing me in a living tomb deep beneath the manalava plain
there came a terrific thunderous crash the impact of which caused me to rise from the ground and fall again yards away
with the crash came the blinding flash of some terrible explosion
a great hissing sound reached my ears and then i heard a loud earsplitting shriek
i looked overhead at the fissure in the earth through which filtered the soulgladdening sun light
i caught a glimpse of a great sphere travelling at a terrific speed into the sky
as it sped away the shriek of its passing became less discernible and soon died out altogether
the jovians had departed for their own planet taking allie lane her father and driftin sands with them gradually the earth roar ceased and with it ceased the earths heaving stared around me now able to see the entire chamber
not an object remained in it not a fragment of any of beautiful purple and gold drapes that had decorated the room which had been allie the jovians had removed every object while i lay on the floor apparently dead
abaris ray could not have struck me squarely or else he had been too feeble and weak as the result of his wounds to do more than stun me temporarily
in my rapid search of the room i discovered that the upheaval caused by the departure of the great interplanetary traveler had sealed the tunnel in which i had hidden during the conflict between sands and abaris
the tunnel through which abaris had suddenly appeared was likewise closed with massive rocks
as a last resort to escape from the underground world i began to study the possibility of crawling to the surface of the manalava plain through the wide fissure overhead
the opening was too high for me to reach up and obtain enough of a handhold to support my weight
i spent hours working constantly piling some of the broken rocks from the tunnels under the fissure
eventually i succeeded in grasping a sharp rock protruding from the side of the crevice and hoisted myself up
it was hard that climb to the outer world
presently after what seemed hours of backbreaking labor i reached the surface
how good it was to breathe the pure air of death valley again the atmosphere in spite of the terrific heat of the manalava plain was sweet and beautiful
my lungs long since taxed with the foul nauseating atmosphere of the tunnels and caverns deep below me pumped madly as i breathed in the delightful air of my own world the manalava plain as far as i could see had strangely become ruffled and strewn with broken rocks
wide fissures and crevices were visible at every hand and on several occasions as i picked my way off the plain i was forced to leap over them or make wide detours in order to pass
after terrible torture i eventually reached the spring in the little hidden canyon
there i drank deeply of the water that had previously been pale green in color and was now strangely colorless
i looked around the weatherbroken wagons and searched the old trunk that sands had found before we started to follow the phantom wagon with its two mysterious humans but failed to find anything in which i could carry a supply of water
after rolling in the spring i struck off across the valley
it was hell friends and i would have lain down many times to die but the ever present vision of my wife and youngsters over at balch constantly beckoned me to continue
so here i am and i thank you gentlemen for saving my life i have doubts ended the strangest and most fascinating narrative that i had ever heard in my entire career as a newspaperman
i sat breathless at the very fearlessness with which the man narrated it and i could not help but believe him
it seemed impossible for him to conjure in his imagination in so short a time such a weird story
it could not have been done even by the most versatile tellers of fabricated stories
long before he had finished his narrative night had fallen and with it had come its myriads of brilliant stars glowing overhead
so entranced were professor bloch and i as he told it that we failed to notice that the shrouds of night were lifting in the east as the sun cast its first vermilion rays into the darkened heavens
through the night the foreman had continued his tale uninterrupted and when he eventually finished mumbling his thanks to us the desert world had suddenly become brilliant with the everchanging colors of a desert dawn
i stared intently into the glowing coals of the camp fire fascinated over the strange experiences he had unfolded to us
it was hard very hard to believe that tale but somehow it rang true
i shuddered at the thought of the grotesque jovians and their uncanny powers
the professor remained silent lost in deep thought apparently mulling over the story in his scientific way
i glanced at him quickly expecting to see doubt written plainly on his features
instead they were more serious than i had ever beheld them
the foreman hung his head in a stupor of exhaustion
dowell professor bloch suddenly called to me as i sat staring into the fire
the abruptness of his voice caused me to jump nervously
yes professor i answered very glad that the awesome silence which had settled over us after the foreman had finished his narrative had been broken very much awake sir
my friend said the professor seriously you have heard this gentlemans weird story
tell me plainly just how you have taken it
do not be afraid to express yourself
well professor i said nervously
it is difficult for a layman to accept such a story without basic facts yet i feel that certain portions of it are true
taking into consideration the fact that astronomers have just about proven that life exists on certain distant planets it is not difficult to believe their assertions that its development there could be much further advanced than our own in scientific achievements
it seems quite natural that any form of life on jupiter would differ greatly from our own due to atmospheric conditions and environment
as for radium it seems quite possible that a great quantity of it would contain more qualities than are found in the small amounts of the metal that we have been able to obtain
however in my opinion there seems to be but one factor in the narrative that has caused me to doubt a certain portion of it
pausing i cast a quick glance at the mineforeman
his head still hung in the stupor of exhaustion
he appeared to be sleeping soundly in a squatting position
i looked at professor bloch
he was regarding me thoughtfully chin resting on his suntanned fists
then i continued it seems to me professor i said eyeing him that if the jovians were immortal and could not be killed as this gentleman has related there couldbe no existing skeletal remains
you say that dr jamesson has recovered a huge skull
this man claims it fits perfectly with the facial characteristics of the jovians
under those conditions it is hard to accept that part of the narrative due to the fact that this man says that the jovians cannot be destroyed and yet identifies a skull as being in exact conformity with the cranial structure of the terrestrial beings
how could it be possible to recover the skeletal remains of any creature that is allegedly immortal and therefore immune to death
your scientific observations and opinions my friend professor bloch said enthusiastically are great for a newspaperman
i congratulate you
your city editor told me that you were the best hand on the outstander at scientific matters and i believe him
however i have gone over the narrative thoroughly and find in it the very same faults you have mentioned
but i actually believe this man told the truth the green tint which marks his skin was undoubtedly caused by radium
i have seen radium affliction several times and its power discolors the human skin permanently when it is exposed to its rays for any length of time
i agree with you when you say that radium in large quantities must have more qualities than are known to exist in the small amounts recovered
as for the huge skull which dr jamesson recovered
it is my opinion that the jovians were not entirely immortal that is when they are outside of their accustomed atmospheric conditions
it is easy to believe that they achieved immortality on their own planet for we today on this globe are slowly approaching a period when longevity will be increased to an astonishing degree
it is my prediction that we too will some day have achieved immortality to a certain degree inasmuch as radium is already known to have removed the cancerous tissues of the human anatomy that cause death
however i have reasons to believe that some of the jovians were destroyed by the peculiar atmosphere of this earth when they arrived here
naturally they could not be accustomed to our atmospheric conditions and results were that only the fittest survived the rigors of an alien planet
we must consider that years must have been consumed before they actually succeeded in locating the underground source of the radium deposit
those who were unable to keep up the strenuous pace weighted down by the earths own atmosphere were quite naturally cast aside
some of them could not survive
hence the skeletal remains recovered by dr jamesson
but professor i argued seriously how could they survive the slugs from this gentlemans gun
such a slug as shot from his calibre of gun would kill an elephant instantly
that my friend is one of their secrets of immortality
i do not know how they could survive
i can merely hazard an opinion
this man narrated that a peculiar green liquid poured from the wounds
i am convinced then that a radium compound instead of blood coursed through their veins with power enough to heal even the most gaping wounds instantly
radium flowing through their anatomies would have the power to banish the leaden slugs even as they entered
the lead like other lesser metals would vanish into invisible atoms under the embrace of radium and would therefore have no more effect upon the jovians than would pulverized dust
but great heat alien atmospheric conditions or some tremendous violence would actually destroy a jovian if he were not of the most hardy sort
i feel certain of that my friend
the professor makes a promise remained all that day at the camp by the mesquite springs
after a hurried breakfast we lay down and slept until late afternoon
the heat was terrific and it beat down upon me with deadening effect
i slept through it dreaming terrible dreams
eventually i was awakened by professor bloch who had already prepared a light lunch
the mineforeman was holding a pan of sizzling bacon over a tiny fire while the professor set other victuals on the tail of the buckboard
i rubbed my eyes sleepily and tilted my hat forward to keep the burning sun from searing my face
we almost left you dowell
professor bloch laughted good naturedly
you were sleeping so sound and dreaming so pleasantly that i hated to disturb you but our friend here thought it best to take you along just as soon die from the heat there i guess as melt completely here eat i want to get back to los angeles
the city editor is reserving a room for me in the icehouse
very well were starting now
immediately after lunch we started across the valley toward the mysterious red streak of tableland that marked the manalava plain
for hours we rode in the bouncing buckboard for hours it seemed we walked along side of it to relieve the laboring animals
the sun beat down with terrific intensity and the heat waves danced blindingly from the sand
eventually we found it necessary to continue on foot leaving the burros and the buckboard in a little partly sheltered arroyo
about noon we arrived at what the foreman claimed to be the spot where he and sands had located the radium pool
the surface of the manalava plain was a jumble of broken rocks and a maze of wide crevices
we stared at a deep craterlike depression before us but it was void of anything in the form of liquid
nothing but boulders lay in its basin and the sides had crumbled in steep loose rockslides
for what seemed ages we searched around the surface for some opening that might lead us down into the deserted tunnels and chambers of the jovians
none could be found
evidence of some great recent upheaval was everywhere and search as we did we could locate no avenue by which we might enter the strange underground world
presently professor bloch decided that the underground domain had been destroyed completely by the upheaval caused no doubt by the tremendous force of the radium in propelling the spacetraveler from this earth
disconsolately we trailed back to the buckboard
when we eventually returned to los angeles professor bloch refused to make a public statement regarding the foremans strange experiences and i was henceforth unable to submit the narrative for publication in the outstander
i did however write an account of dr discovery of the peculiar skull and hinted indirectly at its remote connection with the chain of evolution on this globe and the possibility of this world being invaded at some future period by martians jovians or venerians but the outstander published only a few garbled paragraphs that were unintelligible and valueless
and for many months i have secretly withheld the narrative until at last i have mustered courage enough to submit it for publication to a scientific journal
readers of science wonder stories usually can tell fact from fiction
they know well that many unheard of tales come from the vast jungles of desert wastes and invariably they are true one thing professor bloch did say was that if money and inventive skill could be obtained an attempt might be made to go to jupiter to rescue the unfortunate trio
if such a thing were to happen i will be one of the crew
the end the problems of space flying by translated from the german by francis currier by gems back publications inc is quite certain that captain noordung preceding articles on space flying have proven revolutionary
if the letters from our readers are an indication of what the rest of the scientific world thinks of these articles we feel sure that they will prove prophetic in the years to come in this concluding installment captain noordung proposes some further revolutionary thoughts the most outstanding of which probably is his giant floating mirror perhaps the most frightful weapon ever conceived by man
and it should be noted that as in his preceding articles the final installment is based upon pure scientific reasoning and there is nothing contained in any of the articles that will not come into actuality sooner or later
as a matter of fact all of the instrumentalities so vividly depicted by this gifted and noted german engineer could be constructed today if a sufficient amount of money were forthcoming
continued the investigation of the stars observation from the spatial station opens the most splendid prospects for asstronomy
in this case also there is the possibility of using telescopes of any desired size beside the advantage of having the radiation of the stars reach us unchanged
the blackness of the sky would also help by its contrast the observation of the radiation of stars
fig showing how it is possible by use of a simple concave mirror to converge the suns rays on an object and so ignite it
this latter circumstance would permit all those observations of the sun which from the earth are possible only at total eclipse by simple exclusion of the suns disk through a round black shield
our entire solar system with all its planets asteroids comets big and little moons etc could be investigated in the minutest details
even venus and mercury the two inferior planets that is nearer to the sun than the earth could be observed just as well as the superior planets those farther away than the earth
from the earth as we have remarked this is not possible because of the phe361 nomenon of twilight
the surfaces of all the neighboring heavenly bodies the moon venus mars and mercury could be closely examined so far as they are visible to us and could also be mapped by telephotography
even the question of the habitation of the planets might probably be definitely decided
the most interesting discoveries however would doubtless occur in the realm of the fixed stars
many an unsolved problem of these extremely distant bodies would be explained
our knowledge of cosmic events would be increased so far that we could with absolute certainty decide about the past and also the future fate of our own solar system and the earth
all these researches would have besides their other significance the greatest importance for the further development of spatial navigation
once we know exactly the conditions in those realms of space on the heavenly bodies a flight into space would no longer be a trip into the unknown for much of its peril would be lost
a giant floating mirror the possibilities of an observatory in space are not yet exhausted
from the fact that the sun shines not only in infinite power but also uninterruptedly aside from short chance passages through the shadow of the earth use might be made also for many technical uses on earth
from the spatial station itself the suns rays even on the greatest scale could be artificially directed upon various regions on the surface of the earth by properly constructed giant floating mirrors circling about the earth in free orbits and thus floating above it as proposed by oberth
according to his suggestion they should consist of separate facets which are so arranged in movable fashion that from one point by means of electrical influence they can be given any desired po362 sition with regard to the level of the entire mirror
by proper adjustment of the facets it would then be possible to spread the entire solar energy reflected from the mirror according to needs over wide expanses of the earths surface to concentrate it on individual points or finally when it is not needed to let it radiate into space
fig
how the giant mirror in space proposed by the author may be used to give perenniai daylight tol the earth
the mirror is on the side of the earth that ia turned away from the sun
the suns rays strike it and are reflected to the earth or any part of it where the concentration of the rays produces the equivalent of the direct light and heat of the sun
the fact that such spatial mirrors would be weightless because of their motion in orbits would materially simplify their manufacture
according to oberth a circular wire network is to serve as a frame being spread out in space for this purpose by rotation
in its meshes the separate facets would be placed consisting of sheet sodium as thin as paper
according to his estimates such a mirror with a diameter of kilometers would cost about and would require about fifteen years to construct
besides this there would probably be other possibilities of building such a giant floating mirror
with smaller diameters of only a few hundred meters it would be possible to give the entire mirror so rigid a construction that it could be turned in its entirety about its center of gravity by means of rotary motors and could be given any desired change of position
the electrical energy needed for guiding such mirrors would be amply available in the spatial observatory
the guiding apparatus itself would have to be in the observatory proper so arranged that it could be used during simultaneous observations through the giant telescope so that it would be possible to direct most exactly the illumination of the mijror on earth
the use of this equipment would be manifold
important harbors or airports great railroad stations even entire cities could be illuminated at night cloud conditions permitting by natural sunlight
how much coal could be saved if for example berlin and the other great cities were illuminated in this manner
the most frightful of weapons mirror like every technical achievement could also be used for the purposes of warfare and what is more it would provide a weapon far surpassing in frightfulness everything thus far used
it is common knowledge that very considerable temperatures can be produced by concentrating the suns rays with a concave mirror such as with the aid of a burning glass
even if the mirror is no larger than a hand it is possible to kindle directly pieces of paper even such things as shavings of wood etc which are held at its focus
if we now assume that the diameter of such a mirror is not merely ten centimeters but several hundred or even thousand meters as would be the case with a mirror in space then steel would melt and even incombustible materials could hardly resist permanently if sunlight so tremendously concentrated struck them
and assuming that the observer in space with the aid of his mighty telescope saw spread out before him the entire field of battle with the country behind the lines of the enemy with all his routes of approach by land and sea all this like a gigantic map showing even the smallest details
then we can form an idea of what such a spatial mirror guided by his hand would mean as a weapon fig showing the sun and the orbits of the suns planets
this indicates the relative distances of the various planets from the sun
the four minor planets
earth mars venus and mercury are only a fraction of the distance that the four major planets are from the sun
by using it there would be no difficulty in blowing up the munition dumps of the enemy setting fire to the depots of his supplies and melting his cannon armored turrets iron bridges the rails of important railways etc moving trains factories important for war even entire industrial establishments and great cities could be burned
troops on the march or in camp would simply be carbonized if the bundle of rays of this concentrated sunlight were passed over them
and the ships of the enemy no matter how powerful they were or how strongly fortified the harbors in which they sought refuge could not possibly be protected from it
they would be destroyed burned out as we eliminate vermin from their hiding places with the blast flame
these would be actually the rays of death
yet they are no other than the lifegiving ones which we daily desire from the sun
in this case however we would have a little too much of a good thing
yet matters would scarcely come to all these horrors
no power would ever venture to begin a war with a nation having control over such frightful weapons
to distant heavenly bodies i our previous considerations we have not dealt with travels beyond the realm where the attraction of the earth is paramount
how are matters with regard to the real purpose of the journey in space the complete separation from the earth and the reaching of distant heavenly bodies
first let us briefly view the stellar universe as it will be viewed from the standpoint of spatial navigation i e as future realms to travel
we must therefore change and enlarge our mental outlook
for if we wish to regard the entire cosmos as our world then what has hitherto seemed to us to be our world the earth will be our home in the narrowest sense
not the earth alone
all else that is bound to it by its gravity such as the future station in space and even the moon must also be reckoned as part of our narrow home in the universe as belonging to the realm of the earth
after all how small the distance from the earth to the moon is some kilometers compared with the other distances in space it is only a hundredth of the distance of our nearest planets venus and mars
and the sphere that would be made by the moons orbit around the earth could easily find room inside the sun
the first unit in space to consider beyond our earth is the solar system with all the various planets belonging to it
there are eight principal planets of which our earth is one together with numerous other heavenly bodies
most of the latter the asteroids periodic comets meteors etc are of small size
of the planets mercury is nearest the sun then follow venus the earth
mars jupiter saturn uranus and finally neptune
accordingly venus and mars along with the moon are the direct neighbors of the earth
all these heavenly bodies are permanently bound to the sun by the power of mass attraction and compelled constantly to revolve about it as a centre in elliptical paths
they form the realm of the fixed star the sun
illuminated and warmed by the splendor of its rays and also controlled by the steadfast might of its gravitational pull they are joined in eternal union an island in the emptiness and darkness of space
such is our greater home in the universe the solar system
this is a realm indeed of tremendous size even light though it hurries through space at the speed of kilometers a second takes more than eight hours to cross it directly
yet how tiny is this world as compared with the incomprehensible extent of the universe from which many heavenly bodies the fixed stars heated even to a gaseous state send us the greeting of their shining rays
even the nearest of them alpha centauri is lightyears away that is about times as far as the diameter of the whole solar system
all the others however are much farther from us most of them hundreds and thousands of lightyears
and if there were already extinguished fixed stars nearer us in the eternal darkness of empty space we could never see them
from this it is already apparent that as for travelling to distant heavenly bodies we can now take into account only those belonging to the solar system
the technique of travelling manner in which distant travel through space would have to take place would in general be in free orbits about those heavenly bodies in whose paramount fields of attraction the trip takes place
within the realm of the sun fig showing the sun and the orbits of the four minor planeft
mercury venus earth and mars
this indicates also the relative distances of the orbits from each other fore we must move around the latter always in some sort of free orbit if we are not to become subject to its gravity and plunge into its sea of fire
certainly we need not pay special heed to this point as long as we remain in the narrower realm of the earth or of some other world in the solar system
for each of thdse revolves about the sun in its own free orbit so to speak and with it at the same time and because of it all the bodies belonging to it
with the earth whose speed is meters a second there also revolves the moon at present and there would revolve our future station in space the moon and the station being both satellites of the earth
all of these bodies going around the sun its attraction thereby loses its direct effectiveness on them
this is called the stable condition of floating as regards the sun
only when the space ship passes out of the narrower region of attraction of one of the heavenly bodies revolving around the sun would it have to travel around the sun in a free orbit of its own
for example if it is a question of a trip from the earth to a distant planet then on the basis of what has been said not only the course of this independent path but also the time of departure from the earth must be so chosen that the space ship arrives at a point in the orbit of the planet to be visited at approxinuitely the same time as the point is passed by the planet itself
hfc
showing the effect on a body rotating about the aun of a change in its velocity
if the speed of the body such as the earth ia accelerated it will withdraw from the sun to a new orbit
if the speed is retarded it will approach to form a new orbit
if the ship is thus brought into the region of attraction by the planet to be visited then the possibility is open of either circling it in a free orbit as a satellite as often as desired or descending on it
in case the planet has a blanket of air like that of the earth the landing can be by a method already considered for landing on the earth landing manoeuver by use of decreasing ellipses
if a blanket of air such as the earth possesses is missing then the landing can be effected only by recoilbraking making the force that operates the ship work in the opposite direction to the direction of fall during the descent
in order to journey within the solar system to another heavenly body after successfully getting free from one it would be necessary to change the orbital motion which we would have previously acquired around the sun along with the original planet by the assistance of the propelling force
thereby we would enter an independent orbit about the sun this serving as an intermediary orbit to join the orbit of our own planet with that of the other
according to the laws of celestial mechanics for this purpose the original orbital motion must be altered according to the location of the goal that is it must be accelerated if the ship is to go away from the sun and retarded if it is to approach the sun
finally as soon as the desired heavenly body is reached the independent motion of the connecting orbital path must be changed to that which the ship must take in relation to the new planet in order to carry out the manoeuver of circling about it or of landing
the return trip would have to take place in the same way
it is accordingly clear that in the course of such a distant trip through planetary space repeated changes in the condition of motion are necessary
these must each time be effected by propulsion with artificial power and therefore require the expenditure of fuel
this expenditure according to calculations is least when the orbits of the original planet and that to be visited are not cut by the connecting orbital path of the ship but are merely touched by it in any event the necessary amounts of fuel are considerable
still greater amounts must be added if the planet to be visited is not to be circled about but actually landed upon directly
the amount of fuel needed in fact increases with the mass of the planet and accordingly with its power of attraction
this is understood when it is considered that ascending again from it in starting the return trip requires a very considerable expenditure of energy as is already known from such an ascent from the earth
if furthermore the braking on landing must be done by means of the propulsion recoil braking in the absence of a suitable atmosphere then there results a further tremendous increase in the necessary fuel
moreover this fuel must all be taken along on the trip from the earth at least on the first visit to a remote planet for we could not count beforehand on being able to secure there the fuel needed for the return trip
the start from the surface of the earth commence such a trip directly from the surface of the earth and to overcome its gravity it would be necessary to also lift this whole supply of fuel
according to previous remarks this of itself demands a most extraordinary expenditure of work
in the case at hand at least with the efficiency of fuels now available the amount necessary to be taken along would accordingly make up so great a part of the total weight of the ship that its construction would be hardly possible
the only visit to a heavenly body which could be undertaken directly from the earths surface by means of fuels known now would be the circumnavigation of the moon for the purpose of a closer observation of the nature of its surface especially on the side of it always turned away from the earth
in the course of this we could be imprisoned by the moon to circle about it as often as desired in a in other words if the ship moves tangentially to the orbit of the planet it leaves and takes a path that brings it tangent to the orbit of the new planet the energy required would be a minimum
editor free orbit like a satellite of the moon
the amount of fuel needed for this undertaking would not be much greater than for a normal ascent from the earth to the practical limit of gravity
the spatial station as a basis for spatial travel conditions would be considerably more favorable however if as oberth proposes a fuel depot were constructed floating at a proper height above the earth and constantly circling about it in a free orbit to serve as a starting point for the trip instead of the earth
in this case only a slight expenditure of work would be needed to be entirely free from the earth and the ship would accordingly not need to be loaded with the fuel neccessary for the ascent from the earth
only a little more would need to be taken along than would be required for the distant trip itself
since the depot as a result of its free orbital motion would be weightless the fuel could simply be placed there in any amount freely floating at any point in space
if protected against the rays of the sun even oxygen and hydrogen could be kept indefinitely in a solid state
the supplying of it would have to be managed by a constant travelling of space ships back and forth
this might be from the earth or from the moon
in the former case the fuel at least so far as it consists of liquefied oxygen and hydrogen could be produced in great power plants operated by the heat of the tropical ocean
the moon would be an especially advantageous base as max valier suggests
there the mass and accordingly the force of attraction are much smaller than those of the earth which would greatly lessen the expenditure of work needed for the ascent and therefore for the carrying of fuel from it
certainly this presupposes that the necessary raw materials are actually present on the moon that is that there is at least water even in the form of ice
the latter would be electrolytically decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen the required energy being provided by solar power plants
unfortunately the probability of this is not too great
if it should be the case however we could use the moon also as hohmann suggests for the starting point of spatial travel and accordingly make the fuel depot on it
in spite of the many advantages of this plan proposal of a freely floating depot seems more favorable because from it the complete release from the field of attraction of the terrestrial region including the moon would demand a considerably smaller expenditure of energy
indeed from the standpoint of economy and energy it would be doubtless most advantageous to establish the depot one or several million kilometers from the earth especially if the fuel has to be transported to it from the earth
we shall nevertheless transfer it to our station in space making the latter thereby the base for the travelling because it is already supplied with all the equipment necessary
an especially important part of the equipment would be the giant telescopes
thanks to their almost unlimited efficiency they would make it possible first to examine minutely from a distance the regions to be travelled in the stellar world
furthermore the space ship could be kept under constant observation during a large part of the trip and frequently during the whole of it
by means of light signals shown by the ship at appointed times there could be a communication at least on one side
thus the spatial station aside from the many duties already mentioned would be able not only to initiate real travel about the universe but also to serve as an operating base for all spatial journey
the accessibility of the neighboring planets has thoroughly investigated the problem of visiting other heavenly bodies
according to his results expressed in terrestrial chronology the trip from the earth to venus would last days and that to mars a round trip including circumnavigation of both venus and mars at the relatively slight distance of about eight million kilometers could be performed in about a year and a half
for visiting venus and landing upon it including a stay of months together with the trip there and back not quite years would be required
let us assume that the journey is to commence according to our previous observations from the spatial station so that final release from the field of gravity of the earth would require only a little energy
the return takes place directly to the surface of the earth so that no energy at all need be used for this
one can descend merely with braking by air resistance
let the weight to be transported be two persons together with the provisions needed for the entire trip and all the apparatus required for observations and other purposes
hohmann calculates that the space exploring ship ready to start provided with all the fuel necessary for the trip both ways must weigh approximately as follows for the previously mentioned round trip including circumnavigation not landing of venus and mars tons per cent of this being fuel for the first landing on the moon tons on venus tons on mars tons
in the first of these three cases per cent in the other two about percent of the entire weight of the ship would have to be fuel
the expulsion speed of meters a second from the earth is assumed
it is clear that the construction of a ship to carry rocket propulsion fuel making up per cent of its entire weight would present such considerable technical difficulties that its manufacture could hardly succeed at present
accordingly only the moon of all the larger heavenly bodies next to us could at present be in question for a visit including a landing
however we could at best approach verynear the planets and circumnavigate them without however landing on them
still we have hope that in the course of time by the aid of the principle of sectional construction we may finally succeed even with the technical means known today in constructing space rockets which can even execute landings on the neighboring planets
fig showing two ways that a body can travel from one planet to another
the first way shown on the left which is the easier the body leaves the planet on a tangent to its orbital path and travels sqi that it approaches the orbit of the next planet on a tangent to its path
the smallest amount of power is required for this
by the second method shown on the right the body is forced to cross the orbit of one planet to get to the other
this would be necessary if the calculation as to the path to take in space has been badly done
this method takes a greater amount of power than the first for the body is forced to travel further away from the sun and therefore overcome for a greater distance the suns gravitational pull
doubtless this exhausts all the possibilities which seem to be offered to spatial navigation in the present state of science
for the difficulties would be far greater which confront a visit to more distant planets of the solar system
it is not merely that the routes to be travelled are far longer than those hitherto considered
since all these planets are at greatly different distances from the sun than the earth in reaching them the field of gravity of the sun plays a considerable part
this attraction would have to be overcome by energy
if for example we travel away from the sun i e ascend from it we must overcome its pull exactly in the same manner as when we travel away from the earth
this is shown in the previously mentioned change in orbital speed about the sun necessary in distant travel through planetary space
but if we wished to descend on one of these planets tremendous amounts of fuel would prove necessary especially in the case of jupiter and saturn
these in consequence of their enormous masses possess very powerful fields of gravity
as for reaching the fixed stars their extreme remoteness alone makes them impossible of consideration
distant worlds does not affirm that we must for all time remain confined only to the region of the earth and the neighboring planets
if we succeed in increasing the repulsion speed in recoil action beyond the amount of or perhaps meters a second thus far reckoned the highest practically attainable or if we find a possibility of storing very great amounts of energy in a small space then the situation would be entirely different
and why should not the chemists of the future develop a propelling material far surpassing in effect those already known it is even conceivable that in time we shall succeed in making technically serviceable and in using to propel space ships those tremendous amounts of energy confined in matter energy whose existence we already know
perhaps we shall also find a method of using for this purpose the electrical phenomenon of cathode radiation or by some other way to attain a tremendous increase in repulsion speed through electrical influence
there might lastly come into question a suitable use of the suns radiation or of radium decomposition etc
certainly natural possibilities for future investigators and inventors are still plentifully available in this respect
if success should result then we could visit and actually set foot on many of those faroff worlds which as yet we only view at immeasurable distances in the starry heavens
an ancient dream of mankind
would its fulfillment be of any use to us
certainly science would make extraordinary gains
no certain judgment is possible today regarding the practical value
how little we know of even our nearest neighbors among the heavenly bodies the moon still a part of the region of the earth our narrower home in the universe is of all the distant heavenly bodies the one best known to us
it is cold has no covering of air and is without any higher form of life
it is a gigantic mass of rock floating in space fissured inhospitable rigid in death a world of the past
but we have considerably less knowledge regarding the body next best known to the moon our neighboring planet mars
but in comparison with our knowledge of other planets our knowledge of mars is considerable
mars too is an aged world though not nearly so old as the moon
its mass and therefore its force of attraction are both much less than those of the earth
it has indeed a covering of air yet of far less density than that of the earth
on its surface the air pressure is certainly considerably lower than even on our highest mountain tops
apparently it possesses water
a fairly large part of this may be frozen its mean temperature seems to be much below that of the earth even if in places as on the martian equatorial belt comparatively high temperatures have been determined
because of the thinness of the atmosphere the differences in temperature in the day and at night are very great
the strangest and most discussed of all martian observations in the phenomenon of the socalled martian canals
even though recently they are often regarded as merely optical illusions we really know nothing about them
at any rate what we already know about mars does not offer us enough clues to be able to form a final judgment as to whether this planet is inhabited by intelligent creatures or by any creatures at all
it would hardly be habitable for persons from the earth chiefly because of the rarity of its atmosphere
therefore it would offer spatial navigation an extremely interesting object of investigation from the scientific standpoint
but whether landing there would have practical value as well cannot be recognized today with certainty
it hardly appears likely however
it is another matter with our second neighboring planet venus a splendid shining heavenly body known to us as morning star and evening star its size its mass and therefore the force of gravity prevailing on its surface are only slightly less than those of the earth
it also has a covering of air doubtless very similar to ours though somewhat deeper and denser
unfortunately venus is hard to observe from the earth because it always appears near the sun and therefore is only visible at twilight
accordingly we are still entirely uncertain about its rotation on its axis
if its period is approximately that of the earth about twentyfour hours as is widely assumed then venus and the earth would have a marked resemblance
it is therefore with this planet that we may mo6t reasonably count on finding conditions of life similar to those on earth even if the suspicion that it is always covered with clouds should prove correct
even on the earth there was a highly developed life of plants and animals at a time when part of the water now filling the oceans was still in the form of vapor
certainly of all the heavenly bodies known to us venus offers the greatest likelihood of being suited to occupation and thereby of coming into question as a future goal of travel
since it is also the nearest of all the planets it might well be the most enticing object for spatial navigation
mercury being still nearer the sun offers even less favorable conditions of observation than venus
it is the smallest of all the planets having a covering of air which is probably only extremely thin and a surface apparently similar to that of the moon
for these reasons and especially because of its closeness to the sun the solar radiation is about nine times as strong as on earth extremely unfavorable temperature conditions must prevail there
mercury would accordingly be hardly at all inviting as a place to visit
although in considering the previously mentioned planets it was possible to arrive at a fairly probable result what we so far know is insufficient for the purpose in the case of those more distant jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
we have indeed been able to determine that they all have dense coverings of air
the question of the nature of the surfaces of these planets is however still entirely uncertain
with jupiter and saturn this is because they are so densely enveloped by condensation products clouds of some sort or other that we apparently do not see their real surfaces at all
in the cases of uranus and neptune it is because their extreme remoteness prevents more exact observation
concerning their value as goals for space travel it is difficult to say anything
yet merely the circumstance that we have determined in the case of these planets a relatively low average density from to of that of the earth leads to the conclusion that a very different physical condition must exist from that of the earth
this alone must greatly lessen our expectations of a visit
still it would perhaps be possible that some of the satellites of these planets more especially those of jupiter would offer comparatively more favorable prospects
one thing is absolutely certain the mass and consequent force of the field of gravity of each of these planets being tremendously greater than those of the earth would make visiting them exacceleraton c
fig
a speed curve showing the method of acceleration and deceleration in going from point a to b
the body is uniformly accelerated from rest until it reaches maximum speed halfway between a and b then it is uniformly decelerated until it comes to rest at b traordinarily difficult especially in the case of jupiter and saturn
regarding finally the various other bodies belonging to the solar system it is reasonably certain today that we could hardly derive any special practical benefit from visits to them
we see therefore that we may not be too optimistic about the advantages to be expected of other members of the solar system
but thus far we certainly know far too little not to let our thoughts have a free rein in these respects
it might well be that all these worlds will prove to be entirely worthless to us
on the other hand perhaps we would find on many of them a fertile soil plants and animals possibly of a sort entirely odd and strange to us
they might even be of gigantic size like those once existing on the earth
indeed it is not incredible that we might find even human beings or similar creatures maybe even possessing civilizations very different or even older than those of our ative planet
it is even highly probable that life on distant planets in case it exists there is on another level than that of the earth
then we could experience the marvel of viewing conditions from the evolution of our earthly existence conditions of the present time real and living yet pictures of a past or future countless millions of years away
or it might be that we would find valuable substances which are very rare on earth such for example as radium occurring in an easily obtainable form
if the conditions of life discovered there were the suitable for permanent occupancy perhaps then incredible as it may sound today distant planets would in the course of time come into question for emigration and colonization
as we have remarked before there is little likelihood that there are such suitable planets among those of our solar system with the single exception of the planet venus
end
the onslaught from venus continued from page the second line dived below them and the third drove head on into the enemy air formation
it seemed as if the entire atmosphere of the world blazed and flamed for a split second
the three front lines somewhat shattered readjusted themselves to normal formation
and my own line was driving through acrid smoke as below me fell away the grotesquely twisted fragments and wreckage of umbrella ships and planes
i took my hand off my guns
there was nothing to shoot at
there were no umbrella ships left
and a few seconds later our great sheet of planes swept down low in an undulating dive and drove along strafing the struggling and disordered formation of the enemy
it was kaleidescopic
our speed was terrific
twenty thousand heavy calibre machine guns spat forth an instantaneous blanket of flaming death that pinned down the invaders by untold thousands
here and there fanray machines raised fluttering futile pale canopies of wouldbe protection
but our shells were not of metal now
great lumbering masses of machinery heaved and plunged along on their queer leverlike legs only to tumble ponderously into great shell holes or suddenly shiver and tremble like living things then settle down with a weakly waving metal leg or two and die
as suddenly as i was plunged into it all i found myself out of it
subconsciously following the line ahead i had zoomed and looped my way into the comparative peace of a higher level
automatically my brain registered the signals clicking in my ear phones and i found myself streaking for a new rendezvous preparatory to a second attack
but we never delivered that attack
we were called off
the enemy mob which no longer could be designated as an army was plunging frantically against our new ground positions and for miles along that line unyielding regiments of infantry stood off the hordes of an alien planet
the end saw little of what followed
to us there were vague hazy scattered movements of large and small detachments of troops and the interminable ripping and rumbling of barrages
little more was visible from our height
but there is no need for me to tell how the high command finding that our lines actually had checked the the demoniac fury of the venus lunges and knowing their entire army was in disorder threw all available reserves into the fight even going to the extent of arming the girls regiments in the auxiliary services and hurling them into the welter how the divisions of earth surged forward shooting hacking and thrusting their way irresistibly through the invaders until to the last man and woman they were beaten and hunted down to that death which they preferred to surrender
for there already exists a voluminous history of that particular phase of the struggle
i have often wondered at what place and time during this great struggle the venus girl nyimeurnior met her end and the old miorurlia who learned english from me
and i have often wondered too at that peculiar lack of sympathy with which my memories and my speculations as to their possible fates are tinged for i am not by nature an unsympathetic man
there seems to be no other explanation for it that i can find than a fundamental planetary antagonism
these people of venus were intelligent beings much like us of earth in appearance and in many physical respects
yet i could not feel for them the friendliness that i would feel for a dog cat yes even for a familiar insect of this earth
i am convinced that the civilized nations would have extended them aid and mercy as a matter of principle even after we had experienced this peculiar repulsion upon actual contact with them
they would have been given a section of the world they could occupy in peace and relative comfort the almost uninhabited jungles in which they tried to establish themselves for instance had they not blindly insisted on precipitating a struggle that could end only with their extermination
but perhaps there is some little understood law of the universe that was only proving itself in this case
these people of venus did not belong on earth
and though they showed superability and superpower in crossing the barriers of space and in maintaining themselves in the midst of conditions physically adverse though they unquestionably had the intelligence to cooperate with earth men well let me suggest it this way perhaps having had the effrontery to transgress successfully some fundamental propriety of the universe it was ordained that they should destroy themselves in that accomplishment
but their vast labor and ultimate desperate terror was in vain
they might have better met their end on venus dying without struggle or without vain hope

page a treat for science fiction readers i you are a reader of this magazine we naturally presume you to be a science fiction fan and if this presumption is correct we know that like most fans you cannot possibly get enough of good science fiction literature
many science fiction readers have continuously urged us to get out science wonder stories twice a month or oftener
in order to accede to their wishes we now publish a sister magazine to science wonder stories under the name of air wonder stories
do not jump to the conclusion that air wonder stories is purely an aeronautical magazine it is nothing of the sort
it is a science fiction magazine just as truly as is science wonder stories containing just as many kinds of science
while it is true that in air wonder stories we publish which will be published in the september issue
here is one of the greatest science fiction stories of the year
mr olsen with his shrewd foresight has given us a tremendous amount of new science of all kinds and endless possibilities which are sure to come about during the next hundred years
table of contents by harl vincent author of the menace from below by lowell howard morrow author of islands in the air by victor ies with an aviation background yet all of the stories are first science fiction and aviation second
practically all of the authors and many new ones we have discovered who contribute to science wonder stories are now also contributors to air wonder stories
and whether you are airminded or not you do yourself an injustice if you do not read air wonder stories
some of the foremost science fiction stories are found in this new magazine
do not miss the september issue of air wonder stories it is so chockfull of excellent stories
you probably know bob olsen the creator of the fourth dimension stories
he has written a rattling good scientific story entitled by robert leitfred technical department for those interested in aeronautics letters from readers please turn to page of this issue
a moving picture film of a dawn on the moon was taken recently at the princeton university observatory and exhibited
the mechanism for taking the pictures was perfected by fleming arnott of upper montclair the pictures were taken at the rate of one every six seconds whereas the usual rate is about to one second
by means of a 23inch telescope the moon is seen as it appears miles away
at a rate the sunlight is seen creeping across the lunar landscape the darkness being broken abruptly by the strong glare of the sun
there is no intervening rosy haze as on earth neither is there a twilight after the sun has disappeared
the discovery of nebulae of stars mentioned in these columns found to be travelling away from the earth at the tremendous velocities of to miles per second is proof of the einstein theory of relativity according to opinions of famous astronomers in the new york times the high velocities it is suggested are really illusions created by the crumpling of space according to the relativity theory
light waves travelling through enormous distances of space are distorted
further the idea that space is curved is verified by the data taken on these fastmoving stellar universes
dr clyde fisher curator of the american museum of natural history said that the validity of the einstein theory is now generally accepted by most scientists and that the newer discoveries about the stars may lead to proof that cosmic space long held to be illimitable has definite limits and that light instead of travelling on indefinitely is hedged by this closed universe
dr harlow staple of the harvard observatory said that according to the einstein theory very distant objects would show a spurious velocity of recession
by the use of a tiny thermocouple two astronomers at mt wilson observatory have been able to make measurements of the moons temperature before and after an eclipse says popular science
the instruments are so small it is said that if a thousand of them were placed in a balance it would only need a drop of water to equal their weight
dr paul epstein of the california institute of technology has determined from the experiments that the frozen surface of the moon was once covered with fiery volcanoes
he found also that pumice of volcanic origin cooled at about the same rate in a laboratory as the moon did between exposure to the sun and an eclipse
the irregularities on the moons surface are believed therefore to be of volcanic origin
two layers of ozone in the earths atmosphere one due to ultraviolet light from the sun the other due perhaps to particles or corpuscles shot at the earth from sunspots were described at the meeting of the american geophysical union
in telling of his studies
dr fowle of the smithsonian institute said that one of these layers of ozone which is a form of oxygen shows an annual period of change depending on the position of the earth in its orbit
he thinks it is due to ultraviolet light which varies in intensity at different times of the year
unlike this layer the second layer of ozone shows a close relationship to sunspots
when the sunspots are at their minimum number it will probably be absent entirely though the observations have not continued long enough to ascertain this
dr fowle suggested that some emission of minute corpuscles from the sunspots might account for this layer
the profession of rainmaking is that of the quack says the weather bureau
no known means have been successful in producing rain over any extensive area
the reason for this says the meteorologists is that the lack of rain is occasioned by lack of moisture and if there is no moisture there can be no rain
those men who contract to produce rain usually do so at a time when rain is about due anyway
furthermore the weather bureau estimates it would require to horsepower to evaporate the moisture of a square mile of cloud
surveying the possibilities of life existing on other solar planets waldemar kaempffert in the new york times finds that mars alone has the potentialities necessary
he arrives at his conclusions from analyzing the conditions neccessary for life and subjecting what we know of each planet to the test
the conditions he finds necessary for life as we know it are a climate between limited temperatures an atmosphere containing oxygen this also is dependent on the size and speed of rotation of the planet for only under certain conditions may planets have and hold onto an atmosphere
the next condition is the mass of the planet
if it is too large the attraction of gravity is so great that the organism would have a tremendous weight and be unable to exist
the planet must contain water
the length of the days and the length of the seasons are also determining conditions if life is to exist
only the earth and mars have the proper conditions to support life
but mars says dr kaempffert is a wornout shrivelled senile world thirsting for water
it is agreed that it has vegetation but a tough vegetation
and if any sentient beings existed those who built the canali they probably perished long ago
a new device to prevent stalling is the new fernic distance cruiser a monoplane which will be put through its tests shortly
the method of preventing stalling very commonsense is the use of an auxiliary wing just over the nose of the plane
there is also an additional landingwheel under the nose which will prevent a noseover when the plane lands
the plane has a wing spread of sixty feet and is equipped with wright whirlwind motors
it is expected to make a nonstop flight to some european field this summer
by a recent development of dr alexanderson of the general electric company pilots can now have a positive indication of their height above the ground even though the weather may be so bad that they cannot see the ground
the device consists of sending a radio impulse to the ground from the plane and picking up the same impulse after it is reflected from the ground back to the plane
the ground is picked up as a squeal
whenever the airplane changes altitude by half a wavelength a whistling note goes through a complete tone cycle
by counting the cycles of the tone it is possible to measure the altitude
a meter reading from to feet gives the pilot an opportunity to know accurately his altitude within those limits
as the plane approaches the ground the echoes become stronger
a memory reader is connected with the meter by which the meter continues to hold the altitude reading and give off the same echo until the altitude is changed
connected with the device in a manner not explained are colored lights
a green light flashing on indicates that the pilot is feet above the ground while a yellow indicates feet and a red light shows an altitude of feet
official examination of the recording instruments used in the junkers monoplane piloted by willi neunhofen indicated that he broke the world altitude record attaining a height of feet or less than feet short of eight miles
during his trip neunhofen passed through a temperature range of degrees fahrenheit for it was degrees above zero on the ground and below when he arrived at the extreme altitude
at the top of his climb he became unconscious from cold and his machine went into a glide descending almost four miles before he became conscious again
his safety was made possible by an automobile device attached to the steering wheel
as soon as his hands were taken from the wheel the time when he slipped into unconsciousness an oxygen flow was released and the motor was shut off thus provoking the glide neunhofen states that at almost right miles above the ground leipzig and magdeburg which are about sixty miles apart appear as though they were only a few hundred feet away from each other
the contest for the best foolproof plane which the average man or woman can fly sponsored by the guggenheim fund for the promotion of aeronautics is nearing a close says lauren lyman in the new york times
very few known planes have already been entered in the contests which will award prizes of and a great deal of mystery surrounds the actual plans of airplane makers
believing that the average man or woman will not fly until the foolproof plane has been developed one which does not need an aeronautical expert to safely pilot the guggenheim fund is making the conditions that planes must fulfill rather exacting
eor example one of the nine conditions states that the aircraft must show its ability to take off or land on a plot feet square surrounded by a twentyfive foot obstruction
although the date set for the close of the contest is october only one plane has actually submitted itself at mitchel field long island for the tests
this is a brunner winkle biplane built in brooklyn several other entries are definitely known
because of the infrequency of reproduction in man and long periods necessary to wait before results are shown scientists trying to determine the causes of heredity the determination of sex etc have been obliged to turn to the lower forms of life said dr blakeslee of the carnegie institution at cold spring harbor in this great laboratory many astounding discoveries are being made about the conditions that determine what form life is to take
the experimenters have been able in certain instances to bring a reversal of sex and to endow the offspring with predetermined characteristics
when enough knowledge about the determining factors are known it is hoped that they can be applied to man
that the old conception of races being formed by interbreeding of characteristics is not true is the opinion of a writer in the journal of the american medical association
he brings to the support of his belief the work of sir arthur keith and thomas huxley famous scientists noted for their work on evolution
that the cast of features and pigmentation of the skin are caused independently of racial interbreeding is the conclusion arrived at
the cast of features is said to be due to gland changes and disorders that may accompany environmental changes adaptation or survival as expressed in the evolutionary doctrine
the pigmentation is likewise a condition of environment
if the thyroid glands take on a strange activity declared the writer one might acquire a mongolian cast of countenance
this might also be caused by the endocrine gland when it becomes disordered
motion pictures of the actual operation of parts of the human body were shown by professor turner of the massachusetts institute of technology before the american child health association
by means of xrays which were photographed and made into a continuous moving film the action of glands in the stomach by which food was digested was shown
in another film the activity connected with the swallowing of food was also portrayed
professor turner said he is now making pictures of the action of the lddneys the heart the growth of the teeth and many other physiological functions
the pictures are to be used in schools as a means of visual education of children on the nature and activity of their bodies
professor turner will also exhibit his pictures at the world federation of education associations to be held at geneva
that life and the life processes may be evaluated and studied mathematically is the belief of professor donnan writing in nature london
our bodies and most of our activity are ruled by the necessity of the conservation of energy
we are in effect cell building organisms obeying the laws of thermodynamics
that is the part that we understand
beyond that is the so far inexplicable phenomenon of the cell building up something which is greater than the sum of its parts
that some new form of energy that we are unaware of may be present is the conclusion
that this phenomenon can be reduced to exact measurement and its activity understood through mathematical formulae is believed to be true
that a monopoly in the sale of radium exists and fabulous profits are made on it while thousands of people are dying of cancer is the accusation of the industrial and engineering chemistry edited by dr harrison howe
the monopoly declared the magazine is controlled in belgium where radium costing a gram to produce exclusive of mining costs and overhead is sold for a gram retail and to a gram wholesale
the magazine advocates that special rates be made to research organizations who will promise not to resell the material and so depress the market
the magazine declares that the monopoly now demands all the traffic will bear for a material which means the difference between life and death
a revelation as to how moving picture studios procure their ice rinks for pictures demanding them is made by arthur maas of the maas chemical laboratories in the new york world
having been the source of supply for the ice for studios mr maas feels qualified to speak on the subject
they use he said a warm substance called hypo made from soda and sulphur
it coats on the floor half an inch thick and can be used for skating just as real ice
further after being used the hypo can be melted gathered up and used over again for another rink
mr maas however doubts whether it will be put into general use for that purpose
for the heat that it exudes is enervating
and as it is well known skaters need the tonio of the cold to stimulate them to activity
the treating of cigarettes and matches so as to make them less of a fire hazard when they are discarded was recommended by the united states bureau of standards after a number of extensive tests
that the cigarette butts and matches that are discarded each minute in the united states are responsible for fires causing loss of many millions of dollars in damage was the incentive for the work of the bureau
the cigarettes discarded while still glowing fall on inflammable material such as dry grass and terrible fires are the result
the method of prevention suggested by the bureau is the coating of the last inch or so of a cigarette with a water glass sodium silicate solution
by actual tests made the bureau believes that this will put the cigarette out and reduce fire losses from such causes by the preventative used for matches will be approximately the same the coating of all but a half inch of the match with the water glass so that after the match burns the half inch it will be automatically extinguished
professor schwartz of rensselaer polytechnic institute was annoyed because the athletic signs on his campus faded so quickly so as to become indistinguishable
he determined therefore to study the problem and find a way of making the colors of printing ink exposed to the sun fast
starting with the knowledge that fading is caused by the ultraviolet rays of light the professor has discovered that the use of thorium one of the earths elemental constituents will retard considerably the effect of the rays
dr schwartz hopes that his process may be used for fabrics such as cotton and silk as well as for printing inks
science news of the month portrays in plain yet concise language every important scien tific advance during the month
nowhere can the average reader get such a wealth of accurate and vital information condensed into such a small volume
some scientific journals as well as a score of other sources are util ized by our editors in the com pilation of this department
the publishers welcome short contri butions to these pages from the various scientific institutions laboratories etc
that the lesson of the tragedy of the cleveland clinic should be more farreaching than the immediate results was the conclusion of elvira fradkin writing in the new york times
the clinic floors piled high with bodies should serve as a warning of what to expect from modern warfare which would use gases even more destructive than the nitrogendioxide
for while the nitrogendioxide killed those immediately exposed it lost its effectiveness in the vicinity and did not spread
but some of the gases of modern warfare lewisite and mustard gas dropped from a fast flying airplane over a large city would drop slowly through the city and remain potent for many days
it would fill the subways and homes as well as the office buildings with countless corpses
recent tests have shown that planes can accomplish this and thereby paralyze a metropolis
as the inventor of a process of chromiumplating home fixtures as well as cutlery professor colin fink of columbia university described the advantages of his process
by electrolytically coating any metal object with chromium no drying is necessary
the object may merely be subjected to hot water to clean it and then it may be left alone
the dish towel is doomed he says
the chromiumplated era is about to open
its use is being extended also to ornaments for women replacing even gold and silver
it resembles platinum and has platinums ability to remain without being tarnished
altho pure metals are considered to be the ones that are valuable still they are not usable in that form
practically all pure metals stated sir william bragg of the royal institution of london must be mixed with other metals to form alloys before they become practically valuable
the number of uses that two metals can be put to will vary with the proportions used so that the uses are just as infinite as the proportions
xray3 have shown that the atoms in a mixture form a different pattern thereby changing the qualities of the material
in pure copper the atoms are piled together like spherical shot each sphere touching twelve atoms
when a small amount of zinc atoms are added they distribute themselves among the copper atoms without disarrangement
when however a large amount of zinc is added a new atomic pattern is formed
it is this new pattern which gives the alloy the property of brass which is a copperzinc alloy
that farm relief may come from the utilization of hitherto worthless byproducts of the farm rather than through congressional measures was the belief of chemists expressed at the annual exposition of chemical industries held in new york
many new articles are being made from corn and cotton seeds that formerly represented a large waste to the farmer
corn crops that went into the making of corn whiskey are now used to make lacquer
more than fifty chemical products result from the corn kernel
among these are table oil soap glycerine starch corn syrup etc cotton seeds are now used for producing stearins writing paper smokeless oil toilet ware sausage casings and as many equally incongruous things
among the things also discovered was a new sugar called xylose which can be made from cottonseed husks and is declared by government experts to have absolutely no tendency to increase the users weight
it is about onethird as sweet as ordinary sugar
a group of scientists from the carnegie institution at cold spring harbor will shortly begin a worldwide study of the origin and activity of earthquakes
the first study will be in the lake tanganyika region of east africa
other places on the itinerary include the himalayas sumatra java the philippines china and japan
dr willis who will head the expedition has had worldwide experience with earthquakes
during the severe chile quake of at atacama dr willis made a detailed study
that the presence of hundreds of miles of gigantic ice fields at the poles particularly the south pole constitutes a potential danger to our seaports is the belief of alfred rosewood san francisco scientist writing in the new york american although the ice has existed at the poles for a long time the possibility of them being warmed through changes in climate or having some heated body come close to the earth is enough to make us fearful of fiftyfoot tidal waves sweeping our shores
insanity is due to a large extent to environmental maladjustments declares professor william ogburn of the university of chicago
certain neuroses and psychoses indicate that the individual has failed to make the necessary adjustment to his environment
the chance of a person of fifteen years being placed in a hospital for the insane is about one in twenty the professor said
people unable to stand the confusion and disorder of the city might live happily in rural sections while others languishing in the rural quiet might be stimulated to healthful activity in the city
the modern belief in fasting as a cureall for diseases and a means of attaining a sylphlike figure disregards dangers in the method declares albert parsons sachs of the new york world the result of studies of the population of berlin during the war when fasting was quite necessary discloses outbreaks of many diseases as well as mental and nervous degeneration
although a person can fast for a number of days and apparently have no illeffects this does not prove that none exist
to carry on the metabolism of the body a certain number of calories are necessary to hurntup tissue
a man requires the uses to which the electric eye may be put have been described by the industrial bulletin issued by the arthur little corporation
this little instrument which responds to the slight fluctuations in the intensity of light may control the admissions to a bridge or public hall and count the passersby
it will detect smoke and automatically start an extinguisher it sorts cigars according to the grade as designated by the color of the wrapper
used in a safe it will respond to the outstretched hand of the burglar and ring an alarm
in a store it will respond to the flashing of a policemans searchlight and turn on the lights for his inspection
it counts the vehicles on highways and sets a window display in operation when a passerby stops in front
the discovery of what is the source of cold light as emitted by little sea animals constitutes a great problem for science declared dr charles kofoid of the university of california before the pacific section of the american association for the advancement of science
the mysteries of the luminescent waters of the pacific and partly of the atlantic have been attributed to the metabolic action of small fish called dinoflagellata
it is another of mr conceptions is that the heat of planets depends not alone on the amount received from the sun but that they have a natural heat of their own which depends on the velocity of their passage through the gravitational field of the sun
the faster the speed the more natural heat is radiated away and the lower will be a bodys natural temperature
the problem of soil erosion is becoming such a serious one that a number of interested authorities have gone into the problem to see what can be done to check it
seven erosion stations are to be established in that number of areas by the department of agriculture
the loss yearly due to floods rainwash and gullying is estimated to be field and laboratory studies will be made of the terrain where erosion occurs and the most effective methods of preserving the soil will be determined
the work of the department of agriculture will be handled by the forest service and the bureau of public roads erally calories a day
if this is not forthcoming flesh is used up to supply the necessary energy
further a toxicosis is induced in the blood by the change in its chemical composition when the raw materials necessary for the production of the allnecessary hormones are missing
so the woman or man who achieves graceful slenderness through fasting may find that he has induced some changes in his bodily structure that may well prove unpleasant
the results of recent tests of the effect of sleep on the body and brain find that eight hours sleep is none too much says the new york times editorially
from the results of tests of students at colgate university it was found that four hours of sleep are sufficient to restore the bodily functions to normal
but for the resting of the mind that is not sufficient
the increase in mental power after awakening seems to have increased with every hour of additional sleep
but it was found also that the recuperative value of the sleep depended on the sleeping equipment and the other physical conditions under which the subject slept believed that these organisms which have spread over the pacific in great numbers give off light as part of their process of living
since the action is chemical analysis of the water in which they live is expected to reveal something about them
the intensity of ultraviolet rays can now be measured by a device demonstrated by dr rentsehler director of research of the westinghouse lamp co
the purpose of this is to prevent people who are taking ultraviolet treatments either from the sun or from a machine from receiving terrible burns
for previously no means of measuring the intensity of ultraviolet was possible
uranium which is sensitive only to ultraviolet rays forms the basis of the device
an electrically charged uranium pole was put into a photoelectric cell
the charge generated in the cell by the ultraviolet was transmitted to a condenser and stored until a given potential was obtained
the energy was then discharged through an argon tube which gave a bluish flash
an ink pencil on a chart marked the current of the discharge
by varying the current a scale of values was obtained which acts now as an actual register or dosage meter which physicians can use
the geological survey of the united states now celebrating its fiftieth birthday provides services more varied than are understood by the layman says don glassman in the new york times the topographical map which is an abstraction to the man on the street is often a very valuable thing to a railroad planning a new line
it is the first thing a power company or city seeks for when ready to build a dam or a new reservoir
it has acted as the agent that searched out mineral deposits and led the way to the development of new lands previously uninhabited
ascending mountain peaks and determining their height is part of the work of the intrepid men of the survey
our knowledge of mountain peaks has come principally from them
it is the survey also that provides the maps which become so valuable in time of war
for on these maps which often list every house every stream or every hill or valley the strategy of a major engagement of war may well be fought
the lack of knowledge of a sunken road at waterloo was undoing
editor because of the richness of the modern diet in food and drink the death rate of diabetes reached a new high figure declares the statistical bulletin of the metropolitan life insurance company
according to the company the death rate is kept down by the use of insulin although the drug is no cure
based on its experience with its million policy holders the company found the death rate to be for each persons
in these columns the case of dr gibb of dalhousie university keeping a cat alive for a few minutes by use of a rubber heart was mentioned
now dr goldston of the new york academy of medicine declares that we must not infer thereby that humans can have the same treatment
a writer in the new york heraldtribune however asks why not
people have had metal replacing many parts of their body in their skull larynx etc
the use of rubber hearts is not impossible declares the writer and viewing the alarming number of deaths from cardiac troubles in children from the age of ten to fourteen he believes that someone will consent finally when his heart is giving out to allow the experiment to be done on him
by a device recently developed by dr vladmir zworykin of the westinghouse electric and manufacturing company a photograph or a printed message may be transmitted over a beam of light
the picture or paper containing the printed message is placed on a cylinder which rotates and moves laterally at the same time
a beam of light is projected on the paper and the reflected light gathered by a parabolic mirror which passes it through to a photoelectric cell
this creates an electric impulse corresponding to the density of the light
these impulses are then passed through a gasglow tube which produces the carrier beam of light
this light projected across a room is caught by another parabolic reflector and passed to a photoelectric cell which again changes the impulses into electric impulses
a novel thing about this device is that the actual current is now used to reform the picture
a specially prepared paper bathed in waten is on a cylinder on the receiving end this cylinder rotating in synchronism with the transmitting
the action of the electricity on the chemicals of the paper by electrolytic action changes the color of the paper and recreates the original image
engineers of the bureau of standards have developed a device whereby one can tell whether radio beacon waves are being maintained on their determined course
an indicator will show any deviation or shift in the waves
it will be known as a course shift indicator the instrument may also find use on a plane which is directing its course by the radio beacon
when the needle of the instrument remains in the center of the scale the pilot is in the middle of his course
if he deviates from it the needle will swing to one side
the opening of commercial radiophone service to europe was initiated recently by the placing in operation of the short wave transmission center of the bell system at lawrenceville all telephone messages to europe will in the future be relayed to this station and radioed from there
three separate channels are now in use and it is expected that before the end of the year that two more one to europe and one to buenos aires will be in operation
in europe and in south america similar stations are being built
the transmitting antennae at lawrenceville are strung on 180foot steel towers placed feet apart and at right angles to the direction the voice waves travel
the greatest project ever planned into the causes of mental ills including crime general delinquency sleeping sickness insanity epilepsy and others will be started shortly by the neurological institute of new york
when they have reached the completion of an endowment fund of the institute will have fiftynine leaders in neurology and psychiatry attack sixtyfive important problems of research into the mental ills
the prenatal mental influences as well as the organic changes of the brain which take place in early life will receive a great deal of attention and the mental life of individuals will be studied a completeness never matched before
the institute is not waiting until its fund is gathered in full but will start its program immediately
in a recent test as reported by max valier of germany in discovery london a speed of miles per hour was obtained in a rocket sled
a series of rockets were exploded and at the fifth series the speed was already miles per hour as an average
and inasmuch as the last seventy yards was under brake control the higher speed was believed to have been obtained
herr valier who believes that the rocket will be the future means of propulsion is planning a rocket ship by which he hopes to make a trip from dover to calais this summer
the rocket according to him is in the same position as the airplane was in answering a recent article of joseph caillaux in the new york heraldtribune on the evils of the machine age
secretary of labor james davis defends our age though admitting its imperfections
the machine age is liberating man from physical slavery he says and the advances in science are removing poverty from the masses
although we suffer from a comparison with the golden age of pericles in greece for we have not the great men produced then still he says in that day the thinkers and artists were all aristocrats and the masses were held in dumb ignorant slavery
now we have a wide dissemination of knowledge
in fact more people can read shakespeare today than in the days of the bard himself
the common people of today live better than kings in ages past and for this we must thank the great number of our scientific achievements including the mass production of the necessities of life
to fill the need of persons aboard ship conversing by telephone with persons on land a series of experiments will be started by the american telephone and telegraph company on a service
radiophone will connect the passenger with the companys station at deal beach and from there it is planned the passenger can be connected with any telephone subscriber in the country
the first tests will be conducted between the steamship leviathan and the deal beach station
the transmitters now used for telephony will be used in the tests
the ability to transmit not only objects but their color by television was demonstrated recently at the bell laboratories of the american telephone and telegraph company
on a receiver about the size of a postage stamp were received the images successively of a red white and blue american flag the union jack a watermelon and a pot of geraniums
the transmitter was located about feet from the receiver a wire being used for transmission in this demonstration
the invention is made possible by the use of three photoelectric cells one being able to filter out red one blue and the third green
it would sir oliver lodge denies that the theory of ether filling all space has been exploded
he denies also that einstein proved that the ether does not exist
the ether must exist declares sir oliver
for without it the heat of the sun could not travel across miles to our earth nor could the heat from our fireplace reach us a few feet away
ether is what conducts all electric currents as well as radio waves
in the former case it is not the wire that is the conductor
the wire merely guides the current as rails guide a train
amazing discoveries in physics that are not yet ready for popular consumption are being made at an astonishing rate
sir oliver also declared
they are being made so fast that each year makes those of the year before seem antiquated
the prospects for humanity are bright
although we are barely scratching the surface of universal knowledge we are making progress at an accelerated rate
on properly guided science the hope for the world rests
that the terrible weapons to be developed by science in the future will by their very power serve as a moral persuasion against war is the belief of martyn writing in the new york times when men realize the terrific possibilities of the weapons they are using and have the picture of whole nations which are economically interdependent being wiped out they will hesitate to use those weapons
of all the instruments to be used in the future mr martyn finds the airplane and electricity to be the most powerful
poison gas when spread by shells is too uncertain and there is a limit to the use of high explosives for the more powerful they become the more possibility there is of premature explosion
airplanes controlled by radio will spread death and destruction to whole countrysides
then will come aerial torpedoes which will be guided by radio and detonated at exactly the right moments
television will enable enemies to seek out the most vulnerable points of each other
and finally the use of electric power transmitted over radio beams will enable enemies to electrocute armies hundreds of miles away
if science served only warfare said dr lewis inventor of lewisite it would indeed be a human curse
but the writer feels that the knowledge of this curse will be the most effective bar against war seem then that the device as it is now is limited to those colors
editor
the image to be portrayed is scanned by a flickering beam of light whose intensity varies and which is changed through the photoelectric cell into a fluctuating dectrio current
no new apparatus is needed to transmit colors as attachments to the usual television set will add the color
resulting from an extended series of experiments on the causes of the fading of the intensity of radio waves as received the bureau of standards has arrived at seven reasons for the fading
the experiments were conducted with two stations in maryland using various types of antennae for receiving
the variation of the intensity was studied with relation to the local conditions of the atmosphere temperatures time of day etc and the following results are among those that have been obtained the ray undergoes variation in intensity during its course through the upper atmosphere before it gets to the antennae
in the case of nearby stations much fading is caused by interference between ground and reflected rays
direction shifts are responsible for a certain amount of fading
much fading is also caused by rotations of the plane of polarization of rays reflected from the upper atmosphere during the sunset period particularly
if man is ever wiped off the map it will be due to the onslaught from the insect world according to the new york state college of forestry of syracuse university
the great destruction of all kinds of valuable trees has shown the power of rising insect species and new fungus diseases
means of combatting these insects are unknown and they are rapidly carrying on their work of destruction
since the animals are more adaptable on earth than man and can escape detection they can carry on a systematic work of destroying not only his woods but also his crops and so kill off our race
what is needed according to the college is determined and persistent battle against the insects
bees are not so intelligent as they are reputed to be declares the american bee journal editorially even though they may be possessed of other qualities humans find enviable
a recent test was conducted to determine their ability to return to their own hive when other hiv were placed close to it
bees from a certain hive were marked and then experimenters placed hives of a color similar ta their own in the same neighborhood
altogether bees returned to their correct hive while wandered into hives other than their own
all this happened during a quarter of an hour
in another experiment a photoelectric cell was placed at the entrance to a hive to determine the number of bees that passed in or out
the number was found to be surprisingly small
a that the modern city with its tremendous overcrowding and its storing of physical and psychical explosive power is a potential menace to the inhabitants themselves is the belief of stuart chase as expressed before the league of industrial democracy
he showed a city to be resting on an ever weakening substructure compressing noxious vapors storing human carbon dioxide and lying exposed to attacks from the sky
gases and clouds from the sky poison vapors from below and carbon dioxide between was his description of the city
transportation systems overburdened pump us back and forth between places where we would rather not work to places where we would rather not live until a saturation point and a tragic breakdown results
the only solution mr chase can see is to have the city planner in complete control
i this department we shall publish every month your opinions
after all this is your magazine and it is edited for you
if we fall down on the choice of our stories or if the editorial board slips up occasionally it is up to you to voice your opinion
it makes no difference whether your letter is complimentary critical or whether it contains a good oldfashioned brickbat
all are equally welcome
all of your letters as much as space will allow will be published here for the benefit of all
due to the large influx of mail no communications to this department are answered individually unless 25c in stamps to cover time and postage is remitted
the jury brings its verdict editor science wonder stories i have read every issue of the new magazine so far published and hence am going to tell you what thoughts i have concerning it i will put in my opinion in trial form so lend me your ears alsoi your eyes
the courtroom was crowded with science fiction fans the jury was ready the judge was seated and then there came a low murmur from the massed spectators
halfway honest
criticism was coming
behind him came his assistants brickbat critic and comment among them in formidable array
stories looked to his friends
he was a defendant very much worried
wonder whos defending old said one fan to another
his answer came with the appearance of lawyer appreciative praises
lawyer praises was not alone it seemed for with him was old reader
the court having been called to order the trial began
criticism to the delight o the audience put stories on the stand
after the usual ritual criticism said gravely have here mr stories some complaints against you and as district attorney i adjure you to tell the truth about them object shouted praises suddenly mr stories is already sworn in
objection sustained said the judge coldly
then to proceeding to take a sip of water go on
number one complaint is that you express preposterous ideas
do you voice was hard
no
as you well know the preposterous ideas of one decade are the accepted things of the next
let that go then said the prosecutor uncomfortably
next we find it said that your science is pseudoscience
well said stories with a smile have nearly twenty scientists of high repute on my board of science editors
criticism flushed pass that for now your answer is good enough he muttered hastily
going on to point no it is said that only halfcrazy ignorant people like your ideas and read them a real preposterous idea for you cried indignantly
such people would never understand instructive stories often written by scientists themselves
criticism was stumped
he turned to praises
your witness he stated
praises looked at stories
passed said he the defendants stories spoke for themselves or rather mr stories did
another witness queried the judge began criticism when he suddenly felt a tug at his sleeve
he looked at brickbat who sat at his side
why yes just one more witness
mr brickbat will take the stand
brickbat went to the stand confidently
well what is your testimony asked criticism read one issue of this magazine and its wonderful came the surprising answer
those complaints have been proved grounded in an ultimate sense on nothing and for the magazine first last and always
criticism snorted and turned to praises suppose youve no questions he grunted
no i havenot
then the state rests
the jury was not out long
what is the verdict asked the judge guilty l of what
of being the best magazine on the market lit then presently praises turns to the judge and the sentence
is a long one
i hereby sentence science wonder stories to keep going and growing forever wild applause and court is adjourned
frank kelly kansas city mo
we found mr description of the trial of science wonder stories intensely interesting as well as containing a great deal of subtle truth
anyway we are happy to receive the verdict and assure our readers that old has already begun serving his sentence
editor why is there heat and light through a vacuum editor science wonder stories in the july and august editions of this singular magazine i have been especially attracted by the educational topics entitled the problems of space flying by captain hermann noordung of berlin and your editorial entitled the wonders of space
after having read these articles i was left in a deep abyss of doubt as to the probability of such an enterprise as space flying
i am not a skeptic
i am merely making an attempt perhaps a futile attempt to coordinate logic with guesses
before allowing the profound thinker to begin thinking as to whether space or matter was in existence first donot you believe it would be better to have them solve the relationship of what space really consists
because how could they attempt to solve that ageold question before they know what space is or what it consists of
they contradict their own statements theories and hypothesis so often that it makes ones head dizzy
for instance they say that space is a vacuum
have they any concrete proof of it so that they could without a doubt prove it to be so
did they at any time really attempt to prove it
then they go on to say that light and heat are vibratory motions that on earth these proven facts are transmitted through an unknown phenomena an unknown medium filling alt space
but in space which a vacuum and is therefore devoid of any such transmitting medium because a vacuum is an absolutely empty space how then is it possible for the heat and light waves to reach the earth from the sun moon and stars or even to be transmitted for such a short distance in space as one million miles
i therefore believe that if these same thinkers would solve the mystery of space existing at the present time they should then have a concrete basis to start working on the problem as to whether space or matter was the first to exist
i am in favor and i believe it would be a godsend to the layman for you to publish more such educational articles as the problems of space flying
the other stories are merely good to instruct and forewarn the public of future possibilities
i am and was an ardent reader of your publications and editorials mr gernsback even though this is the first time i take the liberty to praise or criticize
i am a college student and am not ashamed to show your publication around
hymand kaidor bronx
when mr kaidor asks how it is possible heat and light to reach us through the vacuum of outer space he poses a question to which science has as yet found no answer
that is to say it has found no medium through which heat light and even radio waves travel when they pass through a vacuum
it was once thought that some allpervading ether was the vehicle that carried the vibrations
the ether theory however has received a severe jolt at the hands of einstein
the latest belief of eddington is that there is no total vacuum in outer space but a very very thin dissemination of some material
that this material acts as a carrier is to be doubted
we might say however that there is no necessity of an actual carrier medium for light and heat waves
the mystery of their transmission through empty space merely defies our imagination
we profess not to be able to conceive of their passing through a vacuum
the proof of the vacuum of outer space has been obtained by spectroscopic means
of course no one has ever been there to test it but our astronomical instruments can do that job just as well
we do not know that an absolute vacuum exists but we know that it is pretty close to one
we agree that one must not lose his mental balance because one scientist makes a socalled discovery
each person must weight the logic and reasonableness of it before accepting it
editor
does not favor forum editor science wonder stories the cover illustration of the august issue is the best of the three issues so far published
paul certainly is doing his duty
i am sorry to hear of the death of garret serviss
i also read of it in a chicago paper that his articles were published in
why not print some of his stories in science wonder stories i picked out the alien intelligence by jack williamson as the best story in the august number
the radium pool by ed earl repp following a close second and the feminine metamorphosis by keller third
i am in favor of the proposed new department on scientific technical questions and answers
you are taking enough room with science news of the month
neither the latter department nor the proposed one should be in a science fiction magazine
the latest science news can be obtained in any of the many science news magazines on the newsstands
what you publish is not the latest news
so much for brickbats
i received and read the first six of the science fiction series
all of them were very good about how often are you going to put out these books
i liked the paper used in the books and i think it would be a good kind to use in science wonder stories only it should be a little thinner so as not to make the magazine so bulky as it is now
i have nothing to complain against the stories as they all have been very good
jack darrow chicago are very glad to get mr views on the proposed department for the answering of questions on science
the asking for a vote on the question indicates our desire to know what our readers want
we invite our readers to not only send in their votes but to express their views freely through these columns
for it is only by your expressions of opinion that we really know what to give you
editor a thorough classification editor science wonder stories am writing primarily to let you know received the first three issues of your glorious magazine and eagerly await the fourth
however as a secondary matter give you my opinion of your stories
every story i read i put into one of three classes a very good
a story recommend to a person like to enlist in the ranks of the readers of science wonder stories
a story with charm imaginative appeal etc a story i like to reread
a story which is good as long as it lasts but which i do not care to reread
a rare type of story indeed in our magazine
a story in the place of which rather see another
an inferior type
well here goesl a warriors of space james marshall the alien intelligence jack williamson
the moon beasts william locke
the boneless horror david keller the reign of the ray lester and pratt
the marble virgin kennie the threat of the robot david keller the making of misty isle coblentz
the menace from below hari vincent
the eternal man sharp
the feminine metamorphosis keller the radium pool so far ed earl repp
the diamond maker wells
there are none for so far but the diamond maker came near being a total loss
the problems of space flying cannot so far as i can ee be contradicted or criticized in any way
science news of the month is a huge success with me
i see in general science news that garrett serviss has died
i am sure you would be doing many others besides myself a favor by reprinting in forthcoming issues of our mag his five great stories the moon maid the deluge the moon metal the conquest of mars and columbus of space or how would this do
put each of the five stories in a science fiction series book
theodore engel new york city
this is the most carefully thought out classification of stories that we have received thus far
we rather like the divisions into which mr engel has placed the stories
we are sure that our authors will be very much interested to see where theif stories are placed
in case other of our readers disagree with mr classification of any story we invite them to send us their own lists
it would be very interesting to compare them
so far warriors of space has been acclaimed an almost universal favorite despite the criticism that has been levelled against some of its science
editor mr pratt reviews warriors of space editor science wonder stories i donot know how far it is proper for one writer to criticize another but there is a scientific mistake in mr story warriors of space in the june issue that seems to be worthy of some comment
mr marshall terminates his story by having the space cars tow saturn and his moons down and fling them into the sun
now in the first place the body of dimensions passing through the solar system as close to the other planets as it would have to on its way to the sun would be extremely likely to upset the whole system just what direction is largely a matter of guesswork as it involves the problem of three bodies
but it is certain that conditions on the earth would never be the same again nor on any of the other planets
however this is not all
if a body of even asteroidal dimensions were to collide with the sun it would strike the surface with a high velocity and penetrate quite deeply through the rarefied exterior before stopping
its kinetic energy would be changed to heat energy and would form a center of heat greater than anything found outside the bluewhite stars far greater than the heat of the surrounding solar layers as can be shown quite easily by calculation
this heat is sufficient to build itself up by bringing about further releases of energy from solar sources making the center of heat around the planet still hotter and as the sun acts as a perfect gas this intensely heated pocket would explode
it is possible to show that it would blow the upper layers of the sun clean away from it with a force so great that its gravitational attraction could not hold them
the sun would thus become a nova and be surrounded by a layer of rapidly expanding gas rushing outward at speeds of the order of km per second or enough to reach the earth in a little less than the day
now this flaming gas reaching the earth a day afterward would burn the whole business to a cinder in no time at all
a body of size flung into the sun would in fact be enough to make the sun the most brilliant nova in the heavens and life could continue to exist on earth for just about hours after saturn struck the sun
my authorities are seeliger pickering and russell
fletcher pratt brooklyn
in order to completely answer mr criticism of warriors of space we sent his letter to professor samuel barton of the flower observatory university of pennsylvania
professor barton is one of the distinguished members of our board of associate editors
we print herewith without comment professort letter
editor
the annihilation of saturn and its satellites would cause but a very slight disturbance in the solar system
the magnitude of the disturbance which would be caused by pulling saturn through the system would depend upon how closely saturn approached the other planets in its passage and upon the length of time it remained their vicinity
the disturbance to the earth would be very considerable if it approached closely enough to produce the tidal effects described
in the story the mass of saturn was merged with that of the sun
the effect of adding this mass to the sun would be to decrease the mean distance of the earth from the sun by the comparatively small amount of miles and to decrease the length of the year by about five hours
saturn might easily pass through the system and have but little greater effect than this upon the earth
the disturbance possible would range between this and that caused by an actual collision
the effects of the fall into the sun are substantially as described in the second part of mr letter
however as saturn was drawn in it would greatly increase the speed of its revolution about the sun and would not strike its surface perpendicularly
i may state that the attractive force of the sun upon saturn is equal to the weight of tons
this enormous force would cause saturn to move only inches in the first second
if saturn were pulled straight into the sun by the gravitational pull in other words if it fell into the sun years would be consumed in the fall
but the pull of the sun varies inversely with the square of the distance and thus increases at a great rate with the approach of the sun
this gives some idea of the power ascribed to the space cars which pulled saturn into the sun in minus five days if i read aright for in chapter nine wc are told that over days elapsed from the departure of the space cars from the earth before donald gave the command pull and in the tenth chapter we are told that on the thirtieth day from the departure louise noticed the startling events caused by that same wonderful pull
the professor must have been a bit excited when he stated that the light from saturn takes three days to reach us
i fear that the warriors of space from the ninth satellite of saturn which apparently was left behind will sooner or later wreak their vengeance on the earth
the rings of saturn i suppose were placed by donald on the fingers of louise
samuel barton
once called science fiction brainstorms editor science wonder stories what science fiction means to me i glanced at that headline with interest and read the data beneath
then i thought just what does it mean
all i can say now is that i have a great deal of respect for the author of
continued on page science questions and answers month we asked our readers to vote on the science questions and answers department
we received a great many letters from our readers who asked us to enlarge the scope of the magazine by printing answers to scientific questions that they might ask of interest not only to them but to all readers
we put the question to a vote and attached a voting coupon which was to be filled out by the readers themselves
as we go to press we are in receipt of thousands of coupons fully of the votes tabulated show the unmistakable trend of our readers wishes and that is they vote overwhelmingly for a new department
accordingly science questions and answers starts in the october issue
in this department we aim to answer scientific questions which our readers may ask and we will publish those questions and answers which we feel are of interest to the majority
if anything puzzles you in any of the various branches of science such as astronomy biology radio chemistry medicine physics electricity or any general scientific topic write to us but please do not ask more than three questions at a time
this new department does not answer individual questions by mail and of course it will be impossible to publish all questions
the editors will try to answer as many each month as space permits
there is of course no charge for this service
address all questions to the editor
the life of the white ant by the celebrated poet and author the termites the white ants are small insects living in underground colonies without ever coming into the air
their subterranean homes are marvellously built with provisions for ventilation central heating system etc and are topped by a cupola sometimes twelve feet in height
millions of blind termites live within the nest divided into castes
whenever the workers leave the termitaria they use tunnels working their way into trees furniture and walls of houses which they devour silently and invisibly with fearful destruction
all termites are subject to an iron discipline a terrible tyranny which maeterlinck compares to bolshevism in its extreme
maeterlinck does not hesitate to declare that from many points of view the civilization of the termites grim and repellant though it be is ahead of our human civilization that these insects possess a more scientific genius than is found in men
as in the life of the bee the author has drawn from the story of the white ant a profound and moving philosophy of human life and its ultimate development and goal
dr david story the human termites is based upon this book of maeterlinck and anybody wanting to have a better knowledge about termites should by all means read it
add 10c for pottage park place new york the reader speaks continued from page that simple sounding title
if i were the master of a dozen languages i might possibly collect a dazzling array of bewildering adjectives that would exactly express my feeling toward scientific fiction
the first thing scientific fiction ever meant to me was recreation
i used to pounce on every periodical with the idea of seeing my favorite authors latest brainstorm yes i called them brainstorms
now however science with me has become a hobby a recreation and a source of educational experience
i have perused textbooks laboratory manuals and treatises on science of all imaginable sorts
and then i chanced upon my first issue of mr original gift to the world of scientific literature
today scientific fiction to me means the easiest route to a complete knowledge of the relationship of physical and material facts to myself and this planet we live on
this last statement i feel brings my ideas and the printed word into the closest conceivable affinity
i thank mr gernsback again for his second original and startling tribute to modern literature
cooke frankfort north dakota
we were very glad to get mr sincere and understanding view of the value of science fiction
the evolution he says he passed through is quite characteristic of that of most intelligent people
we think it quite natural that at first they view science fiction a9 something absurd extravagant and fantastic
we are quite willing that it be so
for science fiction comes on them as such a new and startling experience that viewing it from the standards of the cold realistic fiction they know they are unable to swallow it
but it is only after they have become acclimated to the thrilling adventures of science fiction and are able to mentally bridge the gap between these adventures and the world of the future that they can write letters such as this one of mr cooke
editor prom harl vincent having just finished reading the july issue of science wonder stories from cover to cover i feel that i must write to you to express my pleasure and appreciation of its general excellence
it can not fail to succeed after the flying start of the first two issues
i am especially pleased with the makeup of my own story as printed
the titling and subtitling of the chapters was done to perfection and improved the story considerably
the concluding installment of is great
harl vincent new york city
we print without comment this letter from mr vincent one of our finest authors edu tor
on lifting the leviathan editor science wonder stories i have received the first two issues of your new magazine and desire to congratulate you both as regards the contents and appearance of this publication
the stories which seem to me to be best are the alien intelligence the reign of the ray and the boneless horror
these three stories seem to be distinctly outstanding the last especially is of a quite unusual type
the first shows a distinctly skillful and alluring use of imagihation and is in my opinion the best of the three
i was much interested in your leading article on gravitation but have you considered the fact that whilst the weight of a body varies from planet to planet the mass or inertia is the same on earth or in empty space
in other words to raise a body weighing lbs we must exert a greater force than lbs weight the magnitude of this extra force depending upon the rate at which it is raised
if we suppose that the man on our imaginary small planet were exerting a maximum force of lbs we obtain the following rather interesting results the ship to be raised to a height of feet would require minutes which would impose rather a strain upon the physique of our strong man
further if he now released the ship it would still continue to rise another inches and would then gradually fall back to the ground reaching it in seconds
the above results can be obtained by simple arithmetic from the two well known laws of kinetics that impulse varies as momentum and space passed over the product of velocity by time
these aspects of the question as indeed the whole discussion although purely theoretical are nevertheless very interesting to work out to their logical conclusions
i approve very much of the good stout paper on which your stories are printed
bain brussels belgium
mr analysis of the problem of lifting the leviathan out in comparatively free space is indeed very interesting
from a mathematical point of view his conclusions are undoubtedly correct
that it would be quite a strain on the strong man we grant
but we believe that for the privilege of being able with his physical strength alone to lift what on earth is tons one must be quite willing to risk the strain
we must look on the feat as quite phenomenal under any conditions
however we are very glad to get mr describes science correspondence club editor science wonder stories i have been wanting to write to you ever since the inception of your magazine but i have been so occupied that i was unable to communicate with you until this time
as you will notice by the letter head i also am a member of the science correspondence club introduced to the public last issue through my fellow member maloire
i might add this to his reference
the clubs aim is to bring together those who wish to compare their pet ideas and theories with others scientifically inclined and to hold debates on the same by mail
thus a correspondence can be kept up indefinitely
the need for such a club was often expressed in the columns of your former organ of science fiction but it seems to have been put off until recently
now i feel inclined to cruelly toss a few more brickbats at the battlescarred veteran authors who have earned it by inserting glaring scientific fallacies in their stories
warriors of space the men of dione had a disintegrator ray that destroyed everything but gold
therefore as they had none of that element which woufd be needed to reflect the ray their own apparatus would be destroyed and the dionians would be as utterly annihilated as the tellurians if the ray had time to generate itself
the marble virgin i advance the same arguments as the other criticizers of the story
moreover the statue was marble all the way through while the human body consists of different organs with variations in the form of protoplasm
again i hold it inconceivable that a consciousness can be endowed as the result of physiochemical reactions
this has never been proved to the contrary and never will be
leonard may jersey city
we were particularly happy to get mr letter as we are very much interested in the activities of the science correspondence club
that there exists a place for such a club composed of people interested in the future of science and in discussing general scientific questions there remains no doubt
we are happy to extend any support possible to make the club a editor universe large enough for him editor science wonder stories in the july issue of science wonder stories under science news of the month i saw the statement that the radius of our universe is miles
this estimate although somewhat conservative substantiates theory of a finite universe
before i saw this article i had calculated the radius of the universe to be miles by a little algebra and less astronomy on the basis of theory that the 96th circle is thelimit of the universe
the 96th circle in a series of circles in geometrical progression beginning with a radius of cm and being doubled each time
although i am but a junior in high school i love to calculate and cogitate on problems and theories
not stopping at the radius of the universe i set about to calculate the volume of it

continued from page miles in the universe would be too large a figure to put down on paper i computed the volume in cubic light years
with the following information gleaned from an almanac length of a year days hours minutes and seconds
speed of light miles per second
i calculated the number of seconds in a year to be thus with the speed of light and the number of seconds in a year i found a light year to be miles
but round numbers are better suited to compute such inconceivable quantities as cubic light years
assuming that the universe is a sphere with the aforementioned radius i found that its cubic content is cubic miles or cubic light years
yes sir this little old universe is large enough for me
wishing you success in your new publication i am earl valet brooklyn
the universe is indeed large enough according to mr calculations to afford us breathing space
we must be impressed with our own insignificance to realize that even traveling with the speed of light it would take us hundreds of millions of years to reach the outermost limits of the universe
in fact there are stars in existence that we will never see because their first rays of light after they came into existence hundreds of millions of years ago are still travelling toward us through space and have not yet reached us editor why is uranus neglected
editor science wonder stories writing this little epistle to air my views on our new magazine
the very first issue sure clicked with me
the second was even better all the stories were excellent and the best were unusually good
the best story in the first issue was according to my way of thinking
jack superb warriors of space
for sheer daring it almost took my breath away
running a dose second was kennie story the marble virgin
it is hard to choose between these excellent stories as to which is best
the reign of the ray failed to go over with me for some reason or other
just didnot hold my interest
as i have remarked above the second issue was by far the best
the paper was far and away of a better class and didnot resemble a western magazine paper so much
the size of the magazine looms big in my eyes for it makes a nice looking magazine die size seems to give it distinction
man but artist paul is sure putting out the goods for our infant magazine
the story that took the cake in the second issue was jack the alien intelligence
talk about a story i also greatly admired harl the menace from below
why is it that our writers never touch upon the planet uranus
i donot remember having read a story that even mentioned the planet
is there no possibility of its being inhabited
why canot we have some stories by edwin stoat
his flight to venus was a sort of masterpiece in science fiction
a sequel to this story would go well with me
i like especially stories of the moon
the best story i have read on this subject was the death of the moon
we ought to have more stories like monorail to the moon by proxy and reprisal
these stories were models of what a short but interesting science fiction story ought to be
just a few words more and i will close
i see nothing but a rosy and successful future for science wonder stoeies for there is no getting around the fact that they are interesting and instructive and when i say this i know what i am talking about for i have read all my life
in fact that is all i do
so just keep harl vincent jack williamson kennie and jack marshall at work not to mention paul and sit still in the boat and donot worry about the future

broadway new york the reader speaks continued from page
it is very interesting to get mr analysis of the first two issues of science wonder stories
we are glad to note also that he liked the second issue better than the first
the majority of comments we received about the june issue were on the stories that mr hood picked as the best the marble virgin and warriors of space
our personal belief is that despite the criticism against its scientific faults the marble virgin hasi an excellent construction and plot
in many ways it embodied characteristics of the model science fiction story
kennie has promised us a sequel to it
mr question about uranus is certainly well taken
uranus is one of the planets about which we know little
it is next to neptune the most distant planet in the solar system and is supposed to have a climate exceedingly cold
it has further no atmosphere and the chances of its being inhabited are quite remote
however some day an enterprising sciencefictionist will study the planet and evolve a surprising story about uranus
we are contemplating for a future quarterly a story about the moon that will make history
editor
religion and science compatible editor science wonder stories i have just been reading what science fiction means to me and the reader speaks in the july issue of science wonder stories
i was surprised at the fact that all the letters in both departments came from the antipodes of our country
california and new york are unusually well represented while from the middle west there is not on single chirp
is the spirit of scientific adventure in this part of the world so dead as all that science wonder stories is living up to the promises you made in your letters to us charter subscribers
the alien intelligence is very good
there comes up that comparison with the moon pool again
i am one of the unfortunates who missed the moon pool and i would appreciate information as to where a copy of it can be obtained
the reign of the ray is too complicated in plot and contains too much matter irrelevant to the scientific part
however one mans meat is another mans poison
the possibility of an immense bubble under the earths crust inhabited or not is captivating and altogether possible much more so than the brain surgery contained in the menace from below
the problems of space flying brings out a lot of obvious points apparently overlooked by space fiction writers
however such detail properly belongs in an article not in fiction
keep on telling us just a little about the stories for next month
it whets our appetite for the feast in store for us
i think the subject of the relationship of the structure of the atom to that of the universe and the possibility of our universe being composed of atoms of matter in a superuniverse where a second of time is an aeon to us is especially interesting and plausible
it also has great possibilities as a scientific interpretation of that future abode where time shall be no more
the fundamentals of religion are becoming more and more compatible with science as research goes on
the man who says that scientific study made him an infidel is either an infidel from the start or is singularly unobservant
it is not too farfetched to believe that even the miracles recorded in the bible were the workings of natural laws with which we are not yet acquainted
i impatiently await the arrival of the first quarterly
foltz indianapolis indiana
we agree with mr foltz in that we see no incompatibility between scientific knowledge and true religion by true religion we mean that feeling of seeing a plan in the universe and drawing a lesson or a philosophical conclusion regarding our place in it and our mode of conduct
the great men of religious thought and teaching and the great men of science have always understood one another
therefore the world of einstein and the world of a great religious leader unbiased and not prejudiced by dogma and cant should be one

editor do it again editor science wonder stories i have the july issue of your new science wonder stories the one with the ship on the cover
may i comment on it
i like the general makeup of it very much though there seems to be too much ink on the illustrations
they are very dark
i have no criticism to make on the stories and their authors but the cover
it is very misleading as it does not have a bearing on any story and not much on the article as i can see
an editorial doesnot warrant an illustration even if it is by you
praise
besides the cover is too well too ordinary commonplace
oh mr gemsback donot do it again
the alien intelligence have made a much finer illustration it now
so paul heres to more fantastic and startling cover drawings
the more daring the better what we all most of us want
your illustration for the moon pool long ago was marvelous
and mr gernsback i hope that formidable array of scientists you have as associate editors wonot influence you otherwise
you probably know what youre about though but remember you have competition the paper
why why do you insist on giving us a magazine so bulky
make it thinner even if you use cheaper paper
make it thinner
the quarterlies are the worst offenders in this line
the table of contents a table of contentment but only list stories articles and the science news department in it
leave out the questionnaire reader speaks etc
other publications
if you put out so many different books and magazines like the quarterly and science fiction series wonot you run out of stories
that would be tough
no
it would be good
then you could publish a lot of reprints like cummings girl in the golden atom and austin tales
why donot you print more of wells also
he wrote plenty
anyhow donot overdo publishing science fiction on account of your readers not being able to keep up with you
i would like to see more shorter stories
by the way why have you quit using the word scientifiction when you popularized it
is that word copyrighted
if it is it shouldnot be
anybody ought to be able to use it put any articles in a fiction magazine unless they are as good as the problems of space flying
i see the ark of the covenant is heading for air wonder 
stories
this is one of the best works of scientifiction there is
lester anderson hayward california
the editor is genuinely grieved that mr anderson did not like the cover for the july issue
most readers who wrote in thought it was good
truthfully we donot mind his saying that he didnot like it that it wasnot truthful that it was too flamboyant
but to have him say it was too commonplace is surprising
for commonplaceness is what we are desperately trying to escape from
and if mr anderson is right then it shall never be again
we therefore invite the comments of our readers to this question
was the july cover too commonplace
the word scientifiction is a trade symbol
the other of mr comments were duly appreciated
they were brief sensibly stated and sincerely felt
regarding the masterpieces of science fiction we have many in store for our readers as for example the human termites in this issue
the stories to come in science wonder stories will make a new high water mark in the production of science fiction
a word to the wise save all your issues

the reader speaks continued from page baffles his friends on science knowledge editor science wonder stories my apologies for not sending in my views sooner but better late than never is my motto
i am one of your younger readers
i wan to say that the magazine is a wonder got my friends baffled on the superior knowledge of science i have over them
now a few criticisms and questions since they are less than the good parts
in the feminine metamorphosis the wonderful woman biologist changed the women in shape and countenance you think that at the same time their views would change to those of a male
it certainly seems logical
and then again please ask dr keller why detective taine never grows old
i remember in the last story he was in the events took a considerable time and at the end he was very old
yet here he is apparently none the worse for the years he has lived
i didnot like the reign of the ray it was too dry the moon beasts was great
give us more of locke
the alien intelligence was a very good story
that new author sharp is good donot let him get away
his eternal man was one of the most interesting stories read so far even though it is short
guess this is enough for some time
will write next month
with best wishes for a successful magazine sidney rishen brooklyn
mr question about the women in the feminine metamorphosis was very well put
the answer is that sex is determined by two sets of characteristics called the psychical and physical
the psychical are the basic qualities of the feminine nature such as mother love vanity capriciousness unstability desire for love and affection etc
the physical characteristics are the more obvious physical ones such as feminine organs size and shape of body coloring and type of skfn tone of voice etc now as we understand it what happened was that only the secondary characteristics were changed by the biologists
the primary basic characteristics remained the same
dr taine is one of those characters who suffer a great many adventures
therefore what happened in the feminine metamorphosis may be simply an incident sandwiched in between those mr rishen referred to
editor
from a prize winner editor science wonder stories i just this evening opened my latest copy of science wonder stories and you can imagine what an agreeable surprise it was to find that my attempt at an essay had been awarded first prize for the third month of the contest on what science fiction means to me it is not every day that an individual finds that has been unexpectedly dumped into his lap so to speak
i think that it was a very agreeable feature of your contest not to let the author of a prizewinning letter know of his good fortune until he has had a chance to find it out through a casual perusal of the pages of the magazine
the surprise is much more pleasant than if he had been notified by letter beforehand
i shall naturally be glad to get the when it arrives but the most gratifying of all is the fact that my humble effort was deemed worthy of being given the honor of first place in a contest of such a nature and when so many far more intelligent and experienced people than i sent in their splendid contributions at the same time
swiggett jr las vegas new mexico
we feel that mr swiggett need not apologize for his letter

continued from page terrible editor science wonder stories considering the facts i fail to see how i am to congratulate you upon your new magazine
to begin with as i did not see any june issue of the book i donot have any idea whether it was better or worse than the issue of july and in my opinion it would not have far to go to be any worse
i received the issue of july and was very glad to do so until i opened it whereupon i was frankly disappointed
i had not counted upon this business of story in two parts part or story in two parts part and in three places too
terrible
under certain circumstances it is it is even expected but in the case of the story the reign of the ray i cannot see the necessity of dividing the story into two parts as you have done the second part of the story is only pages long and most certainly could have been put in one installment
the story the alien intelligence is quite a good story spoiled by dividing it into two parts although it may be necessary
there are some stories which are much better if issued in serial form but that depends upon the type of the story
the moon pool was such a story and a very good one it was
as i said before i was frankly disappointed upon not receiving my june issue and upon seeing the lack of complete stories in the july issue
another thing i did not like was the problems of space flying
i will admit that i read it through and found it worthy of notice in fact it is worth much study it is the principle of the thing that interested in like this if i want to for any reason study such it would not be a hard task to get something on the subject in the library or some such place as that therefore i do not like the idea of buying a book to read for pleasure and relaxation only to be faced by some such discourse which reminds one of theory or something equally interesting
the other stories seem all right but they certainly could be better by far
science news of the month is an excellent feature
i also enjoyed the prize letter contest and congratulate you upon the excellent choice of first prizes
i always enjoy the readers letters and have discovered that many of them show actual signs of intelligence although i have my doubts about some of them
i for one donot see anything to this picture and biography idea which one of them suggested neither can i see why he dislikes coblentz because he is a very good writer
until lately there was never an issue of your former magazine that i did not read clear through and for a long time i had one of every issue ever put out and if its worth it i intend to do so with science wonder stories also
science wonder stories seems to be a pretty good book but it certainly can be improved upon and i suggest more complete stories
no short serials
forget the authors and their histories
a more stories and better ones
futuristic stories and those involving the dimensions
and a lot concerning interplanetary travel
shillito beaver falls pennsylvania
we fee withered under mr indictment
at least that is the first sensation
but then we must calmly reread his letter and analyze it
our fighting spirit is aroused now and we will defend science wonder stories
but only where it will bear defence
if mr shillito is right we must admit it
in the case of the reign of the ray or any other story mr shillito should remember that the size of the book is definitely fixed at pages
if therefore we had run the ten extra pages to finish completely the story we would have been obliged to leave out some other story
which wouldnot have been fair to our readers
we believe that mr shillito is mistaken about being able to get the problems of space flying easily
we brought this book over from germany at a great expense had it translated here and illustration cuts made before we could assemble it for publication
but we are very much interested in mr criticism and because he has something to say we invite him to write us again
editor
from a lover of astronomy editor science wonder stories your first issue has so affected me as to cause me to write and wish you the best of success in your new undertaking
it was certainly a very fine one and interesting as well
needless to say i have become a regular reader and booster of your magazine although i buy my copies on the newsstand
i notice that you have most of the good authors with us and also some new ones who seem to know their science fiction
now if you could only induce edgar rice burroughs to join up with you everything would be jake hesitate at all about reprinting some classics by jules verne or any of the old masters
they are always welcome and appreciated
above all more interplanetary stories
i do not hesitate to say that i am literally fascinated by the study of astronomy
and your magazine has done quite a lot to promote that feeling
i have studied astronomy in my leisure time for several years and have received a great deal of pleasure and knowledge from it
i would be glad to correspond with anyone who is also interested in astronomy am seventeen years old
i have nothing to say about the science news department except that it is quite interesting
i would like to see more astronomical news
i notice by way of your advertisements that you are the publishers of a number of magazines on the different sciences such as radio and aviation magazines etc well why not add to your list of publications a magazine based wholly on interplanetary stories which might be called interplanetary stories magazine
by this time you realize that most of your readers prefer the interplanetary type of story
i see no reason in not accommodating them
i believe that the science of astronomy is more interesting and to my mind even more important than the science of aviation or radio
and i donot see why the science of astronomy could not be presented by an astronomical fiction magazine
i am certain that it would stand upon its own feet
and now i would like you to consider this problem
most interplanetary authors in transporting their characters from our earth to different planets use as a means of traversing the void separating these bodies space ships
the authors have recognized most of the obstacles and dangers standing in the way of space explorers and have eventually explained them or else have left them for the reader to solve
some of these obstacles are of such a nature as to make them probable of being solved or overcome in the future
they are the nullification of gravity proper amount of velocity on starting friction from earths atmosphere travelling at speed of light etc now after a great deal of thinking and much discussion over the various obstacles of space travelling my friend and i have come across another obstacle and try as we might we could not give any satisfactory explanation to overcome it
perhaps you have heard it before or thought of it but i am vitally interested in getting it solved if possible
we know that the air about us presses down upon everything with a weight of approximately pounds per square inch
we also know that there is a corresponding pressure exerted from our body which quite neutralizes the air pressure
if this pressure was not exerted by us the air pressure would be so great that we would cave our bodies would simply fall in
the same way about if the air did not exert the pressure that it did upon us we would burst from the pressure exerted within us
now travelling in a space ship we would have lifegiving air within the ship which would press upon the occupants and even the ship with a weight of pounds per square inch
as the space surrounding the space ship could give back no corresponding pressure to neutralize it it stands to reason that the ship would bust from the inside
which is an example of what our bodies would do if we had no pressure from the air
we have conjectured upon it very much but without success
what do you think about it
and now i believe i will stop as i have already wasted much of your time if you have read it until here
again i wish you the best of success in your undertaking

formerly of schlitz hotel the reader speaks from page
we can agree with mr fox that astronomy is one of the most fascinating of sciences and one of which we still know relatively little
the possibilities of our vast universe are as limitless as the universe itself and the editor is willing to go on record as saying that somewhere in the universe are worlds in which every conceivable thing within the realm of nature has happened
regarding the pressure on the space flyer mr fox should realize the difference between it and the human body
our bodies are made of plastic flesh within and over a framework of bone
fifteen pounds per square inch is quite a large pressure for the flesh to endure for it has little resistance
but a space flyer would be constructed of metal
boilers in operation now use pressure of steam of and pounds per square inch inside whereas outside is only the pressure ot air
and only recently we learned of a boiler which will use a pressure of pounds per square inch
so the mere difference of pressure of pounds per square inch in space is a trifle to the space flyer
captain article in this issue brings this point out nicely
editor
mr pratt not antisoviet editor science wonder stories i note with considerable interest a letter from mr maurice rabinowitz in criticism of the reign of the ray in the august issue of science wonder stories
permit me to say that i think this criticism is based on a wholly inaccurate view of the story
it was not our intention to express either approval or disapproval of bolshevism or fascism as a matter of fact wo donot think much of either system
i suppose mr rabinowitz draws his idea that we wrote the story from an point of view from the fact that we had the united states and italy fighting on the same side against the soviets from the fact that we said the italians had considerable success and from the methods of warfare we ascribed to bolshevist russia
now these things were put into the story not because we are but as a result of careful and we hope scientific consideration of the possibilities of the case
to take up the point in order the war as we outlined it
nearly all european governments as well as our own have refused to recognize the soviet and this recognition has been in many cases almost insulting
on the other hand our own government and all those of europe maintain the most cordial relations with facist italy
we considered that a war would be far more likely to occur between governments which are at enmity than between those which are friendly to each other only cdaimon sense
moreover the soviet represents a system radically different from any other in europe and if it ever got into the control of such fanatics as we have mentioned for the sake of the story it is not at all improbable that russia would set out to clean up the world as revolutionary france did in the past
the italian victories in the story
italy has a large army it is by the common judgment of military authorities in a high state of efficiency if a war were to come it is only logical to suppose it would meet with success
the soviet methods of war
every war in history goes to show that when a country is surrounded by enemies its methods of warfare take on a frantic and violent character anything to win the germans resorted to the use of poison gas napoleon levied on conquered provinces for soldiers and provisions without paying for them general sherman burned out georgia and so on
when a nation is fighting for life it has no scruples at all
i trust that you will be able to bring this communication to the attention of the enthusiastic mr rabinowitz and i would like to ask hini whether there are any other points on which he is hazy
fletcher pratt new york city
we publish without comment this letter of mr pratt in answer to mr rabinowitz
we open our columns to mr rabinowitz in case he should like a rebuttal to mr pratt editor by samuel guggenheimer pages stiff cloth covers size x7
published by new york
price reviewing briefly a book which is a criticism oi the einstein theory is qnite an impossible task
what the presentreview can best do is to indicate what the book contains the method of approach and its value to possible readers
that mr guggenheimer is equipped for his task no one can doubt
his method of analysis is both clear and incisive
he rips his way through theories and abstractions seeking for their logical worth
in this book he takes the einstein method of approach and proceeds to lay bare its logical faults
he finds in fact that the chief basis for the special theory of relativity the constancy of the velocity of light irrespective of the speed relation between the source of light and the observer is an hypothesis only
he claims that einstein never proved it or if einstein did prove it it came as a corollary to the theory that depended on it
like a dog eating his own tail
the present reviewer finds that mr criticism is sound
the famous lorentz equations which are the basis of the special theory of relativity are undoubtedly based on something which is taken for granted
mr guggenheimer however becomes so enamored of his subject that he often wanders off into his own abstruse speculations leaving the reader far behind him
a great deal of concentration and more than an ordinary education is necessary to follow the writer
the book however is exceedingly wellwritten for a scientific work
it suffers however from a lack of cohesiveness
if mr guggenheimer had given in simple terms all that einstein postulated in all his theories and then proceeded to analyze each the reader might have been able to follow him with a feeling as to where it was all going to lead
but while one may agree with the independent conclusions arrived at by mr guggenheimer he is apt to give up in weariness the attempt to discover what it is all about by marcus rosenberg pages stiff cloth covers
size published by dean company new york
price this is one of the most curious books that the reviewer has had the pleasure of reading
in its ponderous style it is reminiscent of kant and the reasoning is at times as lofty as that of the famous philosopher
especially the deductive reasoning to explain such mundane things as a cold or a headache
it is a combination of mysticism transcendentalism and empirical medicine
it is with a curious sense of futility yet with a lingering hope that one turns page after page searching for the beginning of what the title promises
instead the first half of the book is composed of a learned discourse on the fourth dimension the laws of conservation of energy and matter and the quantum theory
in the second part one gathers from the index that we are approaching the heart of the subject
the author treats of colds headaches vaccination and the formation of habits
but gather a few samples of the reasoning used to explain these bodily afflictions and the possibilities of curing them
colds he says have something to do with the nerves of smell
when the soul is not aware that it is in the body respiration takes place irregularly and the nerve of smell want to transmit the irregular breathing vibrations to the soul
since the soul is not aware that it is in the body the nerves of smell have trouble in reaching the souk hence the painful sensation known as cold note not colds and sneezing results representing the irregular breathing vibrations to which the nerves of smell were subjected
an interesting theory of the nature of heat and light is presented in the idea that there is no heat in the rays ofi the sun or any other rays
the light rays striking an object release intraatomic energy of the object in the form of heat
therefore we do not receive heat we generate by catherine mackenzie pages illustrated stiff cloth covers size published by houghton mifflin company new york
price this book is an interesting account of the life of the man known to be the inventor of the telephone
written by one who spent a great many years with him it is well documented and undoubtedly possesses all the facts about life that one would wish to know
in fact it possesses many more than most readers would wish to know
miss mackenzie appears to have been smothered by the mass of material she possessed and while she gives a surfeit of exact dates and facts she nowhere gives a real illuminating insight into the man
the book has a great deal of interest however for those unable to appreciate the mental attitude that greeted announcement of the telephone or speech by telegraph as it was called
curiously enough we learn that bell did not have the equipment of an electrical expert
his ideas and feelings on the subject came from his knowledge of sound as applied to speech
he was in fact a lifelong expert on elocution and was intensely interested anything that related to speech
we find him instead of the typical inventor of that day starving in a garret a young enthusiastic man with plenty of friends and enough money to keep the wolf from the door
it is said about him that if he had known more about electricity he would never have invented the telephone
much of the book is taken un with the years consumed in patent suits directed against him and by him
there is also some interesting material on his less well known scientific experiments on the graphophone the heavierthanair flying machine and on scientific breeding of animals
the description of the way in which the actual discovery of the working telephone came has value because of the light it sheds on the importance of chance in scientific discoveries by morris fishbein pages stiff cloth covers
size 4x7
published by lippincott company philadelphia
price this book by the editor of the journal of the american medical association is part of a onehour series on various topics that the publishers are presenting
it is quite a commonsense collection of the best authorities on such subjects as exercise diet general living habits digestion sleep and vacations
dr counsel in all things is moderation
that applies to exercise eating healthful things taking cathartics and breathing
one could hardly quarrel with his conclusion since they seem to be founded as much on the experience of normal living people as on abstruse medical science
while he praises golf as a form of relaxation and exercise for business men he cites the fact that every year a number of enthusiasts drop dead on the links from heart disease
it was evidently a case of a good thing overdone
dr fishbein finds no great evidence to support the contentions of the vegetarians that their possibility of life is greater than meat eaters
those who eat moderately of meat he finds have just as much chance for long life as the vegetarian
and he adds dryly meat eaters make better company because they have a sense of humor
the author treats most food fads contemptuously
he finds that they are based principally on the desire of some commercial interest to exploit a particular food
the raisin fad was one
a warfare between the eat white bread and do not eat white bread interests now rages
but what dr fishbein does not and evidently cannot state is that these fads are based on the authority of medical men who conveniently make discoveries
but he finds the american public constipated and gullible
they will accept anything as a panacea except right living
they are too busy for that
so the doctor concludes bluntly what fools these mortals be
