but hang -PRON- all i reply give note an irritable shove with -PRON- coffee spoon donot want to go to a confound teaparty i m too old and too sensible to dress up in a tall hat and a long coat and listen to the vaporing of a flock of silly flapper 
i mordieu hear the savage de grandin chuckle delightedly 
always do -PRON- find excuse for not give pleasure to other and always do -PRON- frame those excuse to make -PRON- more important in -PRON- own eye 
enough of this friend trowbridge let -PRON- go to the kind madame party 
always there be something of interest to be see if one but know where to look for -PRON- maybe i reply grudgingly but -PRON- have well sight than i think -PRON- have if -PRON- can find anything worth see at an afternoon reception -PRON- reception be in full blast when -PRON- arrive at the norman mansion in tuscarora avenue that afternoon 
the air be heavy with the commingled odor of half a hundred different perfume and the scent of hotpoure jasmine tea while the clatter of cup on saucer laughter and buzz conversation fill the wide hall and dining room 
in the long double parlor the rug have be roll back and young man in frock coat glide over the polished parquetry in company with girl in provocatively short skirt to the belching melody of a saxophone and the drum rhythm of a piano 
pardicu de grandin murmur as -PRON- view the dancer a moment -PRON- american youth take -PRON- pleasure with seriousness friend trowbridge 
behold -PRON- face 
never a smile never a laugh 
-PRON- may be recruit on -PRON- first parade for all the joy -PRON- show ah -PRON- break off abruptly gaze with startled almost horrified eye after a couple whirl in the maze of a foxtrot at the farther end of the room 
nom dun fromage -PRON- murmur softly to -PRON- this matter will bear investigate i think eh what s that 
i ask pilot -PRON- toward -PRON- hostess nothing nothing i do assure -PRON- -PRON- answer as -PRON- greet mrs norman and pass toward the dining room 
but i notice -PRON- round blue eye stray more than once toward the parlor as -PRON- drank -PRON- tea and exchange amiable nothing with a pair of elderly lady 
pardon de grandin bow stiffly from the hip to -PRON- conversational partner and turn toward the rear drawing room there be a gentleman here i desire to meet if -PRON- do not mind that tall distinguish one with the young girl in pink 
oh i guess -PRON- mean count czerny a young man laden with an ice in one hand and a glass of punch in the other pause on -PRON- way from the dining room a rare bird all right 
i know -PRON- back in when the balkan ally be polish off the turk duck ainot -PRON- 
firstclass fightin man though 
why i see -PRON- lead a bayonet charge right into the turkish line one day and when -PRON- would shoot -PRON- pistol empty -PRON- go at the enemy with -PRON- tooth yes sir -PRON- grab a turk with both hand and bite -PRON- throat out hang if -PRON- didnot 
czerny de grandin repeat musingly 
-PRON- be a pole perhaps 
-PRON- informant laugh a bit shamefacedly say -PRON- confess 
the serb werenot ask embarrassing question about volunteer nationalitie those day and -PRON- wasn t consider healthful for any of -PRON- to do so either 
i get the impression -PRON- be a hungarian refugee from austrian vengeance but that s only hearsay 
come along introduce -PRON- if -PRON- wish 
i see de grandin clasp hand with the foreigner and stand talk with -PRON- for a time and in spite of -PRON- i could not forbear a smile at the contrast -PRON- make 
the frenchman be a bare five foot four inch in height slender as a girl and like a girl possess of almost laughably small hand and foot 
-PRON- light hair and fair skin couple with -PRON- trimly wax diminutive blond mustache and round unwinking blue eye give -PRON- a curiously misleading appearance of mildness 
-PRON- companion be at least six foot tall swarthyskinne and blackhaire with bristle black mustache and fierce slategray eye set beneath beetle black brow 
-PRON- large nose be like the predatory beak of some bird of prey and the tilt of -PRON- long pointed jaw bear out the uncompromising ferocity of the rest of -PRON- visage 
across -PRON- left cheek extend upward over the temple and into -PRON- hair be a knife or saberscar a streak of white show the trail of the steel in -PRON- scalp and shine like silver inlay in onyx against the blueblack of -PRON- smoothly pomade lock 
what -PRON- say be of course beyond reach of -PRON- ear but i see de quick impish smile flicker across -PRON- keen face more than once to be answer by a slow languorous smile on the other dark countenance 
at length the count bow formally to -PRON- friend and whirl away with a wisp of a girl while de grandin return to -PRON- 
at the door -PRON- pause a moment incline -PRON- shoulder in a salute as a couple of debutante brush past -PRON- 
something i know not what draw -PRON- attention to the tall foreigner a moment and a sudden chill ripple up -PRON- spine at what i see 
above the georgetteclad shoulder of -PRON- dancing partner the count slategray eye ere fix on de trim back and in -PRON- i read all the cold malevolent fury with which a cage tiger regard -PRON- keeper as -PRON- pass the bar 
what on earth do -PRON- say to that fellow 
i ask as the little frenchman rejoin -PRON- 
-PRON- look as if -PRON- would like to murder -PRON- 
ha -PRON- give a questioning singlesyllable laugh 
do -PRON- so 
obey the noble injunction and avoid foreign entanglement friend trowbridge -PRON- be well so i think 
but look here i begin nettle by -PRON- manner what non non -PRON- interrupt -PRON- must be advise by -PRON- -PRON- friend 
i think -PRON- would be well if -PRON- dismiss the incident from -PRON- mind 
but stay perhaps -PRON- have well meet that gentleman after all 
i will have the good madame norman introduce -PRON- 
more puzzled than ever i follow -PRON- to -PRON- hostess and wait while -PRON- request -PRON- to present -PRON- to the count 
in a lull in the dancing -PRON- comply with -PRON- request and the foreigner acknowledge the introduction with a brief handclasp and an almost churlish nod then turn -PRON- back on -PRON- continue an animate conversation with the largeeyed young woman in an abbreviated party frock 
and do -PRON- shake -PRON- hand de grandin ask as -PRON- descend the norman step to -PRON- wait car 
yes of course i reply 
ah 
tell -PRON- -PRON- friend do -PRON- notice anything ah peculiar in -PRON- grip i wrinkle -PRON- brow a moment in concentrated thought 
yes i believe i do 
so 
what be -PRON- 
hang if i can say exactly i admit but well -PRON- seem this sound absurd i know but -PRON- seem as though -PRON- hand have two baek no palm at all if that mean anything to -PRON- 
-PRON- mean much -PRON- friend -PRON- mean a very great deal -PRON- answer with such a solemn nod that i burst into a fit of laughter 
believe -PRON- -PRON- mean much more than -PRON- suspect 
i must have be some two eek later that i chance to remark to de grandin i see -PRON- friend count czerny in new york yesterday 
indeed -PRON- answer with what seem like more than necessary interest 
and how do -PRON- impress -PRON- at the time 
oh i just happen to pass -PRON- in fifth avenue i reply be up to see an acquaintance in street and be turn into the avenue when i see -PRON- drive away from the plaza 
-PRON- be with some lady doubt de grandin respond dryly -PRON- notice -PRON- particularly say that i do especially i answer -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- look old than the day -PRON- meet -PRON- at mrs yes the frenchman lean forward eagerly 
old do -PRON- say 
parbleu this be of interest i suspect as much why i begin but -PRON- turn away with an impatient shrug 
pah -PRON- exclaim petulantly 
friend trowbridge i fear jule de grandin be a fool -PRON- entertain all sort of strange notion 
i have know the little frenchman long enough to realize that -PRON- be as full of mood as a prima donna but -PRON- erratic unrelated remark be get on -PRON- nerve 
see here de grandin i begin testily all this nonsense the sudden shrill clatter of -PRON- office telephone bell cut -PRON- short 
dr trowbridge an agitated voice ask over the wire can -PRON- come right over please 
this be mrs norman speak 
yes of course i answer reach for -PRON- medicine case what be -PRON- who s ill -PRON- guy eckhart -PRON- s be take with a fainting fit and -PRON- donot seem to be able to rouse -PRON-

no no -PRON- friend that be not likely 
likely or not i rejoin sharply mrs norman say -PRON- s be seize with a fainting fit and i give the lady credit for know what -PRON- s talk about 
eh bien -PRON- drum nervously on the cushion of the automobile seat perhaps jule de grandin really be a fool 
after all -PRON- be not impossible 
-PRON- certainly isnot i agree fervently to -PRON- as i set the car in motion 
eckhart have recover consciousness when -PRON- arrive but look like a man just emerge from a linger fever 
attempt to get a statement from -PRON- meet with no response for -PRON- reply slowly almost incoherently and seem to have no idea concern the cause of -PRON- illness 
mrs norman be little more specific 
-PRON- son ferdinand find -PRON- lie on the floor of -PRON- bath with the shower go and the window wide open just before dinner -PRON- explain 
-PRON- be totally unconscious and remain so till just a few minute ago ha be -PRON- so de grandin murmur half heedlessly as -PRON- make a rapid inspection of the patient 
friend trowbridge -PRON- call -PRON- to the window what do -PRON- make of these objective symptom a soft frequent pulse a fluttering heart suffuse eye a hot dry skin and a flushed hectic face 
sound like an arterial hemorrhage i answer promptly but there s be no trace of blood on the boy floor nor any evidence of a stain on -PRON- clothing 
sure -PRON- have check the sign over 
absolutely -PRON- reply with a vigorous double nod 
then to the young man now mon enfant -PRON- shall inspect -PRON- if -PRON- please quickly -PRON- examine the boy face scalp throat wrist and calf find no evidence of even a pinprick let alone a wound capable of cause syncope 
mon dieu this be strange -PRON- mutter of a surety -PRON- have the queerness of the devil perhaps the bleeding be internal but ah regardez vous friend trowbridge 
-PRON- have turn down the collar of the youngster pajama jacket more in idle routine than in hope of discover anything tangible but the livid spot to which -PRON- point seem the key to -PRON- mystery outer door 
against the smooth white flesh of the young man leave breast there show a red angry patch such as may have result from a vacuum cup be hold some time against the skin and in the center of the discoloration be a double row of tiny puncture scarcely large than needleprick arrange in horizontal divergent arc like a pair of parenthesis lay sidewise 
-PRON- see -PRON- ask simply as though the queer bloodinfuse spot explain everything 
but -PRON- couldnot have bleed much through that i protest 
why the man seem almost drain dry and these wound wouldnot have yield more than a cubic centimeter of blood at most 
-PRON- nod gravely 
blood be not entirely colloidal -PRON- friend -PRON- respond 
-PRON- will penetrate the tissue to some extent especially if sufficient force be apply 
but -PRON- would have require a powerful suction i reply when -PRON- rejoinder cut -PRON- short ha -PRON- have say -PRON- -PRON- friend 
suction that be the word 
but what could have suck a man blood like this 
i be in a nearstupor of mystification 
what indeed -PRON- reply gravely 
that be for -PRON- to find out 
meantime -PRON- be here as physician 
a quartergrain morphine injection be indicate here i think 
-PRON- will adminster the dose i have no license in america hen i return from -PRON- round of afternoon call next day i find de grandin seat on -PRON- front step in close conference with indian john 
indian john be a town character of doubtful lineage who perform odd job of snow shoveling furnace tending and grass cut accord to season and intersperse -PRON- manual labor with brief incursion into the mercantile field when -PRON- peddle fresh vegetable from door to door 
-PRON- also peddle neighborhood gossip and retail local lore to all who would listen -PRON- claim to be a hundred year old give -PRON- the standing of an indisputable authority in all matter antedate live memory 
par dieu but -PRON- have tell -PRON- much mon vieux de grandin declare as i come up the porch step 
-PRON- hand the old rascal a handful of silver and rise to accompany mo into the house 
trowbridge -PRON- accuse as -PRON- finish dinner that night -PRON- have not tell -PRON- that this town grow up on the site of an early swedish settlement 
never know -PRON- want to know i defend with a grin 
-PRON- know the ancient swedish church perhaps -PRON- persist 
yes that s old christ church i answer down in the east end of town donot suppose -PRON- have a hundred communicant today 
-PRON- population have make some big change both in complexion and creed since the day when the dutch and swede fight for possession of new jersey 
-PRON- will drive -PRON- to that church right away at once immediately -PRON- demand eagerly guess so i agree the matter now indian john be tell -PRON- a lot of fairytale perhaps -PRON- reply regard -PRON- with one of -PRON- steady unwinking stare 
not all fairytale be pleasant -PRON- know 
do -PRON- recall those of chaperon rouge how do -PRON- say -PRON- red ride hood and bluebeard huh 
i scoff both as true as any of story bet 
undoubtlessly -PRON- agree with a quick nod 
the story of bluebeard for instance be unfortunately a very true tale indeed 
but come let -PRON- hasten i would see that church tonight if i may hrist church the old swedish plaee of worship be a combine demonstration of how firmly adzhewn pine and walnut can resist the ravage of time and how nearly three hundred year of weather can demolish any structure erect by man 
-PRON- roughpainte wall and short firmbased spire shine ghostly and pallid in the early spring moonlight and the cluster of broken and weatherworn tombstone which stagger up from -PRON- unkempt burying ground be like soil white chick seek shelter from a soiled white hen 
dismount from -PRON- ear at the wicket gate of the churchyard -PRON- make -PRON- way over the level grave i in a maze of wonderment de grandin with an eagerness almost childish 
occasionally -PRON- flash the beam from -PRON- electric torch on some monument of an early settler bent to decipher the worn inscription then turn away with a sigh of disappointment pause to light a cigar but drop -PRON- halfburned match in astonishment as -PRON- companion give vent to a cry of excited pleasure 
triomphe -PRON- exclaim delightedly 
come and behold friend trowbridge 
thus far -PRON- lying friend the indian man have tell the truth 
regardcz -PRON- be stand beside an old weathergnawed tombstone once marble perhaps but appear more like brown sandstone under the ray of lii flashlight 
across -PRON- upper end be deeply cut the one word while below the name appear a verse of halfobliterated doggerel lot noiuie difturb -PRON- deathleffe fleepe abote ye tombe wilde garlick keepe for if fhee wake much woe will boaft 1rayfe faither sonne holie goaft 
do -PRON- bring -PRON- out here to study the orthographical eccentricity of the early settler i demand in disgust 
ah bah -PRON- return 
let -PRON- consult the ecclesiastique 
-PRON- perhaps will ask no fool s question 
no -PRON- will do that i answer tartly as -PRON- knock at the rectory door 
pardon monsieur de grandin apologize as the whitehaired old minister appear in answer to -PRON- summon -PRON- do not wish to disturb -PRON- thus but there be a matter of great import on which -PRON- would consult -PRON- 
i would that -PRON- tell -PRON- what -PRON- can if anything concern a certain grave in -PRON- churchyard 
a grave mark sarah if -PRON- please 
why the elderly cleric be plainly take aback donot think there be anything i can tell -PRON- about -PRON- sir 
there be some mention in the early parish record i believe of a woman believe to have be a murderess be bury in that grave but -PRON- seem the poor creature be more sin against than sin 
several child in the neighborhood die mysteriously some epidemic the ignorant physician fail to understand no doubt and sarah whatever the poor woman surname may have be be accuse of kill -PRON- by witchcraft 
at any rate one of the beieft mother take vengeance into -PRON- own hand and strangle poor sarah with a noose of wellrope 
the witchcraft belief must have be quite prevalent too for there be some nonsense verse on the tombstone concern -PRON- deathless sleep and an allusion to -PRON- wake from -PRON- also some mention of wild garlic be plant about -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh somewhat ruefully wish -PRON- hadn t say that -PRON- add for do -PRON- know there be garlic shoot grow about that grave to this very day 
old christian -PRON- sexton declare that -PRON- canot get rid of -PRON- no matter how much -PRON- grub -PRON- up 
-PRON- spread to the surround lawn too -PRON- add sadly 
cor dieu de grandin gasp 
this be of the importance sir the old man smile gently at the little impetuosity an odd thing -PRON- comment there be another gentleman ask about that same tomb a few week ago a pardon the expression a foreigner 
so de grandin s little waxed mustache twitch like the whisker of a nervous tomcat foreigner do -PRON- say 
a tall rawboned fleshless live skeleton of a man with a scar on -PRON- face and a white streak in -PRON- hair wouldnot be quite so severe in -PRON- description the other answer with a smile 
-PRON- certainly be a thin gentleman and i believe -PRON- have a scar on -PRON- face too though i can t be certain of that -PRON- be so very wrinkled 
no -PRON- hair be entirely white there be no white streak in -PRON- sir 
in fact i should have say -PRON- be very advanced in age judge from -PRON- hair and face and the manner in which -PRON- walk 
-PRON- seem very weak and feeble 
-PRON- be really qiiite pitiable 
sucre nom dun fromage vert de grandin almost snarl 
pitiable do -PRON- say monsieur pardieu -PRON- be damnable nothing less 
-PRON- bow to the clergyman and turn to -PRON- 
come friend trowbridge come away -PRON- cry 
-PRON- must go to madame at once right away immediately hat behind all this mystery 
i demand as -PRON- leave the parsonage door 
-PRON- elevate -PRON- slender shoulder in an eloquent shrug only wish i know -PRON- reply 
someone be work the devil business of that i be sure but what the game be or what the next move will be only the good god can tell -PRON- friend 
i turn the car through tunlaw street to effect a shortcut and as -PRON- drive past an italian green grocer de grandin seize -PRON- arm 
stop a moment friend trowbridge -PRON- ask would make a purchase at this shop 
-PRON- desire some fresh garlic -PRON- inform the proprietor as -PRON- enter the little store a considerable amount if -PRON- have -PRON-

a trifle certainly that pass interest of a rather commonplace young man but except for that interest and what -PRON- lead to -PRON- would understand nothing of the vast drama that be play around and above -PRON- 
not that -PRON- ignorance or knowledge could have affect the outcome of that drama beside the tremendous force that rise and fight and crash mankind be but a mass of tiny frightened pigmy run about beneath battle giant 
yet one remember that -PRON- be one of those same pigmy -PRON- be a single embittered insane man who loose all of that ancient terror upon -PRON- and cause an ageold cosmic feud to flare out in dreadful war universe struggle with uuiverse in titanic combat immense unthinkable the story as -PRON- know -PRON- begin on that sultry afternoon in august when young ern hunter come into the village of leadanfoot and dismount wearily from hi batter bicycle

the busy shout bellow world seem inconceivably remote in that tranquil spot 
the sun swing higher and high while -PRON- push -PRON- way forward 
and in the world that seem so very far in leadanfoot and london and new york and peke other man be push -PRON- way forward in -PRON- particular groove in life scheme for disk of metal and slip of paper for the admiration of -PRON- fellow for rich or fame or knowledge 
a vast mass of tiny conspirator each intent on -PRON- own plot each sublimely confident of the importance of -PRON- especial business and -PRON- outcome 
and hide in those quiet hill into which hunter advance be that which be to upset all of those minute conspiracy like little house of caid a door through which be to come a menacing terror unknown to man so that presently through this world and world above and beyond would run death and confusion and an ancient dread sun be near -PRON- great height when hunter come to the farther side of lowder hill and the rude path that twist up that side 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- rather doubtfully for the hill seem very steep and the day be almost half go 
then with a shrug -PRON- be about to step forward to the path when the sound of a step behind -PRON- make -PRON- wheel in surprize 
a strange figure be walk toward -PRON- a small middleaged man whose clothe be dirty and tear by briar 
-PRON- be hatless and on -PRON- pink round spectacle face be an expression of dazed wonder 
-PRON- come forward until -PRON- be within a few yard of the astonished hunter then stop and regard -PRON- mildly 
not powell -PRON- whisper softly confidentially 
not -PRON- cease speak suddenly look around with a certain surprize then sink to the ground in a dead faint 
in a moment hunter be by the man side apply -PRON- vagne idea of first aid 
-PRON- get -PRON- pocket flask between the man tooth and a little brandy down -PRON- throat which almost instantly pull -PRON- back to consciousness 
the man lie there -PRON- eye sweep over face then ask quite unexpectedly what time be -PRON- 
on find that -PRON- be almost noon -PRON- straighten to a sit position all right now -PRON- assure the student motion the latter to a seat on the ground beside -PRON- 
-PRON- glance waver about the scene then come back to hunter whom -PRON- regard intently before address -PRON- 
who -PRON- be i donot know -PRON- begin and as hunter start to explain -PRON- add and -PRON- doesnot matter have some education havenot -PRON- 
ah medical student 
that make -PRON- easier much easy 
hunter begin to think that the man be still dizzy delirious 
i better help -PRON- back to leadanfoot -PRON- ask 
there would not be time the other answer strangely be go to leadanfoot -PRON- for but there -PRON- do not know 
there be time to get back though 
-PRON- and but first -PRON- should hear -PRON- catch the doubt halffearful expression on the young man face 
no not a madman -PRON- assure -PRON- almost gently 
but i need help badly 
need -PRON- help 
but help for what ask hunter think if -PRON- would just go back with -PRON- to the village no answer the other decisively 
there be a pause in which the old man stare across the green silence of the valley with unseeing eye 
suddenly -PRON- turn to the watching puzzle student will put -PRON- this way -PRON- begin 
suppose someone be plan to kill every live person in the village yonder to wipe -PRON- out utterly would -PRON- try to prevent -PRON- at wonder reply -PRON- continue of course -PRON- would 
now go farther still 
suppose someone something be try to kill every human be on earth to annihilate the world as -PRON- know -PRON- 
would -PRON- try to stop that too 
the young man stare at -PRON- blankly 
would -PRON- persisted the other 
why yes naturally answer the student and the old man sigh 
-PRON- be to prevent that that i need -PRON- help -PRON- say quietly 
before hunter could comment on that startling statement the man rush on be go to tell -PRON- enough of the matter to help -PRON- understand what threaten 
-PRON- will not think -PRON- a madman when -PRON- hear 
-PRON- have little time here an hour perhaps before -PRON- must start back 
but -PRON- be enough for -PRON- to tell -PRON- will wish to know who i be 
marlowe be -PRON- name and until a year ago i hold a position on the staff of the trent museum in london 
-PRON- be there that i meet powell some three year ago dr henry powell -PRON- be an elderly physics professor lately retire from cambridge 
that be all -PRON- ever tell -PRON- of -PRON- past for even after -PRON- become better acquaint -PRON- be closemouthe about -PRON- former career 
by chance i find the reason for that 
a friend tell -PRON- that powell have leave cambridge under a cloud 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- have be work for many month in collaboration with a fellow professor woode by name on an elementchange experiment 
-PRON- know transmute uranium into radium or radium into lead 
modern alchemy -PRON- be attempt after a year of work together the two have split over some disagreement each carrying on the experiment alone 
woode be the first of the two to publish -PRON- result and immediately powell claim that -PRON- former partner in work have steal -PRON- own result 
there be rather a scandal over the matter but an investigate committee rule that charge be unprove so -PRON- be retire from the university 
i never talk with powell on the matter and never learn the right of -PRON- but i could see that the thing have embitter -PRON- greatly so that -PRON- be will not to snarl viciously at all scientific people and in fact nearly all people of any kind 
-PRON- grate on -PRON- considerably sometimes for -PRON- be like an animated bottle of acid thinlippe sardonic sneering 
but one thing draw -PRON- together a common interest in archeology 
in fact that branch of knowledge be -PRON- work at the museum and powell have take -PRON- up as a sort of hobby to occupy -PRON- restless mind i suppose 
-PRON- get acquaint through -PRON- visit to the museum and have many a talk thereafter 
-PRON- be intensely interested in the vitrify fort of scotland as -PRON- be call 
pile of stone ruin on some of the scottish hill and in a few valley with some of the stone melt into glass hear of -PRON- 
well -PRON- be radical theory that those glassy streak ere not make by lightning as be commonly suppose but by some powerful weapon or ray strike from above 
-PRON- will see what a revolution in conventional archeological thought would be the result if -PRON- could prove that 
-PRON- get to be a fanatic on the subject and spend most of -PRON- time roam about scotland and hunting and dig in such ruin have be off on such a trip for several week when -PRON- send -PRON- an urgent wire from a scotch village name dykirk 
-PRON- have make a great discovery -PRON- say but need -PRON- help and offer -PRON- a handsome salary for -PRON- aid 
-PRON- own interest be arouse by -PRON- messageso i procure the necessary leave from the museum and go at once be meet by powell when i step off the train 
-PRON- turn out that -PRON- discovery be on the summit of a hill some mile from dykirk name keraclian hill 
-PRON- have have a little cottage or cabin build on the hill and have live in -PRON- for some week 
-PRON- take -PRON- most of the day to get to -PRON- little home so -PRON- stow -PRON- luggage and wait until the next morning to inspect -PRON- discovery 
and -PRON- be really astounding 
the summit of the hill be flat and there with a few crumble stono block scatter about but in the center of that level expanse be a shallow pit newly dig that be circular in shape and perhaps twenty foot across 
at -PRON- bottom a foot or so from the surface of the ground lie a flat round stone the surface of which be almost completely cover by a mass of strange character carven into -PRON- deeply 
-PRON- be to decipher this inscription that powell need -PRON- help for i be by way of be an expert in hieroglyphic cuneiform writing and such 
-PRON- say that -PRON- have find this inscription beneath a protect layer of cement of some kind and be afire to learn -PRON- meaning as -PRON- well may be 
so i settle in the little cabin and begin work that very day 
to -PRON- surprize i find the inscription quite easy to decipher for all that the character be totally strange and unknown 
whoever have carve -PRON- have place in -PRON- here and there small picture symbol give a key for -PRON- translation purposely 
within a month i have translate and arrange -PRON- translation of -PRON- and find that the inscription tell a stupendous incredible story 
accord to -PRON- these ruin of forfs that lie scatter through scotland have be build age before by a race of strange folk who have invade the earth then 
and these stranger have come not from another planet as one may suppose but from a single atom in the earth 
this will sound incredible to -PRON- as at first -PRON- do to -PRON- but consider 
-PRON- know that each atom of -PRON- earth consist of a number of electron revolve about a nucleus and what be that but a miniature solar system 
just as -PRON- sun and -PRON- circle planet may be an atom in a vastly large system and so on infinitely perhaps 
the idea be not new -PRON- be advanced year ago 
and in this particular atom of the earth on -PRON- electron -PRON- tiny planet dwelt a race proportionately tiny the atomic people i will call -PRON- 
-PRON- have crowd over every one of -PRON- electronplanet and be now gradually stifle from -PRON- everincrease number 
-PRON- have science a strange sort of science and now at the time of -PRON- great need one of -PRON- scientist announce a startling discovery 
-PRON- have find a way by which the size of any object could be increase or decrease indefinitely at will 
and the secret of this be stunning in -PRON- very simplicity 
-PRON- know that the universal allpervading ether be the base of everything 
vibration of that ether in a certain octave cause light in a different octave radio wave in still another chemical ray 
but what -PRON- do not know as yet what the scientist of the atomic people have learn be that all matter -PRON- be but another vibration of that ether in a different low octave 
that stone that tree -PRON- and all but different vibration in the ether 
and the atomic scientist have find that as a stone be simply an etheric vibration by raise the frequency of vibration the stone would be make large by lower that frequency -PRON- would be make small 
-PRON- method of change that frequency be tell by the inscription 
-PRON- would ascertain the frequency of vibration of an object then concentrate on -PRON- other artificial electric vibration much like radio wave which would change the vibratory frequency of the object just as the rate of swing of a pendulum can be raise or lower by a tiny force apply to -PRON- at the correct moment 
thus these atomic people could make any object make even -PRON- large enough to dwarf -PRON- world or small enough to disappear entirely 
-PRON- be a chance to relieve -PRON- crowd number and -PRON- seize -PRON- at once 
use -PRON- discovery to grow in size -PRON- burst up from -PRON- own atom into this world into -PRON- earth and find that the atom that be -PRON- universe be an atom of a simple grain of sand on earth 
thai sandgrain though hold -PRON- world so -PRON- build a great structure around -PRON- in what be now scotland so that -PRON- would always be there as a refuge for -PRON- to flee to in ease of need 
that attend to up from the atom out of the sandgrain stream -PRON- people gigantic masse of -PRON- 
the earth then be savage and forbidding but nothing daunt -PRON- spread over -PRON- surface begin to raise -PRON- structure of stone to shape this world to -PRON- will 
-PRON- must have seem to -PRON- that -PRON- be secure forever in this great universe 
but now come disaster 
certain adventurous spirit among -PRON- be not satisfied to stop in this universe 
-PRON- see the sun and -PRON- attendant planet and realize that this -PRON- own solar system be after all only an atom in a still great universe 
so a number of -PRON- use the same method of change size grow again until -PRON- have enter the world above this the universe in which ours be but an atom 
now in that great universe in that superworld as i shall call -PRON- there be civilization a civilization of being who have advance far beyond the crude semibarbarism of the people of the atom 
so when the atomic invader enter -PRON- world the superpeople know -PRON- have come from beneath from an atom for -PRON- -PRON- have long possess that power of change size which the atomic people have just discover 
although these superpeople promptly beat back the invader in that first attack time after time in the year that follow the warlike people of the atom persist in attempt to enter the superworld which be so much fair than either -PRON- own world or this one long while -PRON- attack continue until finally the patience of the superpeople be exhaust and -PRON- gather together all -PRON- force to crush these atomic invader foiever 
-PRON- pour down from -PRON- great universe to this earth and then be a battle such as be never know before the people of the superworld and the people of the atom lock in a deathstruggle smiting with strange weapon a colossal war rage over the shudder earth that reel beneath -PRON- 
the atomic invader could not stand against the mighty weapon of the superpeople and soon all of -PRON- not slay be flee in dread to -PRON- own world that sandgrain that hold -PRON- universe 
-PRON- speed back to that grain and down into -PRON- dwindle in size and vanish until of all -PRON- number only -PRON- dead remain on earth 
and now the superpeople set about to seal -PRON- forever within that atom within that sandgrain so that never again should -PRON- break out and carry war and death through the superworld 
to accomplish this -PRON- set that grain of sand within a circle of perpetual electric force a field of strange force within which -PRON- be impossible to grow or dwindle in size as the atomic people have do by change the frequency of etheric vibration 
thus the people of the atom be lock foiever within -PRON- own tiny universe 
this accomplish -PRON- cover the sandgrain and the force -PRON- place around -PRON- set over -PRON- a great stone on which be write the history of what have happen and which warn whoever may find the stone in the future never to tamper with or change what have be do lest -PRON- loose again the atomic invader upon the earth and the superworld alike 
have do this the superpeople leave the earth to -PRON- own device and pass up into -PRON- own great universe 
come then on earth the painj ful upward surge of change ascend specie the long road from anthropoid to troglodyte to modern man 
the structure of the atomic people crumble soon until only a few remnant be leave 
over all the world -PRON- be as if -PRON- invasion have never be nor do man dream that such people have hold the earth age before -PRON- 
and up in a scottish hill under a great stone that be cover by the drift dirt of age lie a grain of sand that hold war and death and terror in a single atom of which the atomic people be prisone for all time be the colossal epic the inscription narrate 
and -PRON- be so convincing that neither powell nor i doubt -PRON- 
but now a dispute arise between -PRON- 
i believe that -PRON- should heed the warning of the inscription and not delve farther into the thing lest -PRON- loose dread upon the world 
but powell be afire with curiosity and ould not listen 
so with help -PRON- remove the great circular stone and set -PRON- to one side 
and beneath -PRON- as -PRON- have foretell -PRON- find the sandgrain that hold the atomic world 
under the circular stone be a cube of the same smooth rock some six foot square 
on the upper surface of this cube be set a small plate of smooth metal at the center of which lie the sandgrain set in the metal 
around this metal plate embed within the surface of the cube be a circle of seven little block that glow steadily with a feeble purple light 
in daylight the little block seem merely purple in color and -PRON- be only in darkness that -PRON- luminosity become apparent 
without doubt that circle of glow block be the producer of the force mention in the inscription the force that make impossible within -PRON- field that hold the atomic people prisoner in the sandgrain 
from that day onward powell take -PRON- less and less into -PRON- confidence 
-PRON- have fit up a small laboratory near the cabin and begin work there on some problem connect with what -PRON- have find 
once or twice -PRON- consult -PRON- eoncernirig the meaning of certain technical part of the inscription but aside from thgt -PRON- tell -PRON- nothing of what -PRON- be do and i decide that i be waste time to stay 
-PRON- be on the very day that i mean to tell powell so and leave that -PRON- come run toward -PRON- excitedly with the news that -PRON- experiment have succeed 
and when i find the nature of that experiment i as astound 
-PRON- have be attempt to follow up the sparse detail give in the inscription and rediscover the method of change size 
and -PRON- have do -PRON- 
-PRON- show -PRON- the apparatus -PRON- have work out a compact black ease which strap around -PRON- chest and which would cause everything within -PRON- field of action to grow or decrease in size 
and stand there on the hilltop -PRON- grow in size until -PRON- tower up a giant of a hundred foot then dwindle until -PRON- be an inch in height a tiny manikin 
-PRON- be exultant and i think that at last -PRON- would leave the hilltop and cover the sandgrain once more 
i point out to -PRON- what good -PRON- may accomplish in the world with that great power but -PRON- only snarl at -PRON- and for the first time reveal -PRON- intention 
-PRON- be plan to dwindle in size until -PRON- could enter that atomic world to go down into the sandgrain to the atomic universe 
short of force i use all -PRON- effort to prevent -PRON- for i be aghast at such a plan 
but -PRON- go on unheede make -PRON- preparation for the trip 
-PRON- dig out and remove the little circle of block around the sandgrain then gradually begin to dwindle in size until -PRON- be a tiny figure a few inch high stand on the metal circle near the grain of sand 
small and small -PRON- become until -PRON- vanish entirely from -PRON- sight and i know that -PRON- have enter the sandgrain 
for three day i atche beside the stone cube wait for -PRON- return 
-PRON- be toward evening of the third day that -PRON- finally come back a tiny upright form on the metal plate that grow swiftly to the man i know 
-PRON- have come back 
-PRON- have come back but change 
-PRON- seem to be fill with an immense excitement to be spur on by some hidden purpose 
-PRON- give small answer to -PRON- flood of question 
-PRON- have find the atomic world have be guide down into that particular atom of the grain by certain sign a phrase which -PRON- do not explain 
as to the people of the atom -PRON- say only that there be many of -PRON- and that -PRON- be different 
more -PRON- would not tell -PRON- and -PRON- fear -PRON- misgiving increase night of disaster rush upon -PRON- a week afjer -PRON- return 
i be asleep in the cabin while powell work as i think in the laboratory 
some time after midnight i wake and sense that powell be not in the cabin 
i dress hurriedly and find that -PRON- be not in the laboratory either 
instantly i know where -PRON- be and hurry up to the hilltop and to the pit on that hilltop that hold the stone cube and the sandgrain 
-PRON- be stand on the edge of that pit watch intensely but at the sound of -PRON- approach -PRON- wheel instantly hold a little stone cone in -PRON- hand the end of which glow suddenly with dull green light 
at the same moment i fall in a heap to the ground and lie there quite motionless seemingly paralyzed unable to move a muscle 
and powell laugh 
-PRON- mock and taunt -PRON- and for the first time disclose the depth of -PRON- plan 
-PRON- be go to loose once more the atomic invader upon -PRON- world 
-PRON- have go down into -PRON- world and conspire with those in power there promise to free -PRON- from the world where -PRON- be prisoner to release -PRON- upon the earth and the superworld 
first -PRON- boast the atomic invader be to strike at the world beyond this at the superworld to stab out unexpectedly at -PRON- ancient enemy in that great universe crush -PRON- by an unlookedfor attack 
then free from any possible interference the invade horde would sweep over earth and -PRON- laugh wildly as -PRON- picture to -PRON- the destruction of the race of man and -PRON- work dwell especially on the fear and terror of -PRON- enemy 
for the first time i see that the man be completely insane an embittered maniac who secrete hate for all mankind as the result of -PRON- wrong real or fancied 
even while -PRON- speak a slight humming sound arise from the pit 
the humming wax swiftly to a loud droning then up from the pit float a black disk some three foot across and swiftly grow 
hover a few foot above the ground -PRON- continue to grow and the droning become a loud boom a tremendous rumbling thunder 
even as i stare at -PRON- lie there i fathom the cause of that roll thunder know that -PRON- be the sudden expansion of the disk that beat out those thick wave of sound 
the disk grow until -PRON- be perhaps thirty foot across then cease expand 
-PRON- slide gently down toward -PRON- until -PRON- be nearly touch the ground and i see that -PRON- be crowd with dark shape that push toward the rail to stare down at -PRON- 
then down from the edge come a folding metal ladder and clamber down this ladder come three creature shape grotesque and terrible three of the atomic people have think of -PRON- as be somewhat human perhaps with different feature or coloring but still essentially human 
but these thing -PRON- be reptilian saurian 
in height -PRON- be a little under the human standard and -PRON- figure be even roughly human in shape with the head carry erect a squat powerful body two thick bow low limb and two short arm end in cruel curve talon 
but with that rough travesty on the human shape all resemblance cease 
to begin with the thing be completely cover with thick hard scale like those of a crocodile 
-PRON- head be peak instead of round with gape fanged mouth and small black glitter eye browless and lashless like the eye of a snake 
-PRON- be noseless and earless and -PRON- only sign of clothing be a queer sort of metallic armor that seem more design to carry -PRON- weapon than as clothing 
lie there motionless regard -PRON- with sickened horror i see the three advance to powell who greet -PRON- with a queer gesture 
one bring forth a tablet like a small slate on which -PRON- write then pass -PRON- to powell who study -PRON- then write in turn and hand -PRON- back 
evidently such writing be only mean of communication with the thing 
for a few minute -PRON- confer in that fashion with powell then return to the disk which immediately ascend from -PRON- hovering position on the hilltop 
as -PRON- rise -PRON- grow spread out swiftly in everexpande size grow until -PRON- have shut off the light of all the star for a few second then seemingly break up into small masse cloudily disappear 
-PRON- have become so large that -PRON- be invisible have pass from this universe into that great one 
for a moment i wonder if -PRON- momentary eclipse of the star would cause any stargazer to guess at what be happen then realize that to any chance watcher of the sky -PRON- would seem only like a drift cloud if notice at all 
again rise the humming from the pit many time louder grow to an earsplitte thunder as another force of the atomic people float up from the pit a great mass of tiny black circle miniature of the first disk that drift up and rise at once into the air not stop to confer with powell as have the first 
and as that mass of disk rise above the hilltop the familiar droning be again wax louder as another mass of -PRON- come up 
how many of the disk stream up from the atom while i lie there i can not guess 
-PRON- number seem infinite but -PRON- memory be fragmentary disjoint 
i must have be unconscious for a few minute at least for i remember that amid the rumble thunder of the rise disk as i watch powell who be gaze triumphantly at -PRON- come a dizzying blackness seem to descend on -PRON- brain and when consciousness return the last mass of disk be rise from the pit vanish like the other in the sky above 
tntil now powell have hold -PRON- prisoner with the glow cone which -PRON- have place on the ground before confer with the atomic people so that -PRON- hold -PRON- prisoner without -PRON- attention 
now -PRON- pick -PRON- up and permit -PRON- to reenter the cabin where -PRON- force -PRON- to lie down in the bunk then place the cone again on the table in the room still point toward -PRON- still hold -PRON- a prisoner powerless to move -PRON- do not kill -PRON- outright i can not say 
i think -PRON- be only because -PRON- desire someone even a prostrate enemy to whom -PRON- may boast of what -PRON- be do that -PRON- desire someone to know the power and the menace that -PRON- really be 
-PRON- must have be so for the next day -PRON- boast for hour to -PRON- of what -PRON- be do 
-PRON- speak of the great force of invader i have see and say that even by that time -PRON- number and mighty weapon would have crush into submission the people of the superworld 
-PRON- speak too of the paralyzing cone that hold -PRON- prisoner a weapon which -PRON- have bring back from the atomic world and reveal that -PRON- have another one on -PRON- person also 
-PRON- be -PRON- say a ray that neutralize the electric message in the nervous system thus wipe out the command of the brain in that system so that while reflex action like the breathing of the lung and beating of the heart be unaffected the conscious command of the brain to the muscle be nullify paralyze those muscle 
all of that day and all through the next night i lie in the bunk without move a muscle save only an hour in which -PRON- permit -PRON- to eat i hear -PRON- leave the cabin early the next morning the second after the coming of the invader this very morning 
lie there i listen with dull despair to the wind slam the door of the cabin 
the cone on the table be in the line of -PRON- vision and suddenly i gasp with hope for at a particularly hard slam that cone have roll a little way toward the table edge 
i wait breathless 
then just as -PRON- hope be begin to die the door slam to with all the wind force behind -PRON- and the cone roll from the table to the floor break and explode there in a flash of intense green light -PRON- first move be to search the cabin for a gun but there be none 
the cabin stand at the edge of the bare and treeless hilltop and from -PRON- window i could see head bob about in the pit of the sandgrain as -PRON- prepare for the coming of the second force of invader 
i know that -PRON- must be imprison or kill at once but know too that -PRON- carry with -PRON- another of the paralyzing cone so that i dare not rush -PRON- on the open hilltop 
neither could i remain in the cabin so -PRON- only chance be to make -PRON- way to the near village and get help or at least a gun 
so i slip out a rear window and get safely away without be see by -PRON- 
all of this morning -PRON- take -PRON- to get down the hill and when i meet -PRON- here i know i should not have time to get to a village as i have plan but must go back and do what i could -PRON- 
and now i have tell -PRON- all 
up on that hill powell be await the second invasion of those monster from the atom an invasion that will annihilate -PRON- world 
if -PRON- can overpower -PRON- and replace the glow block around the sandgrain -PRON- shall have prevent disaster 
if not but do -PRON- believe the story 
will -PRON- help -PRON- 
hunter answer slowly -PRON- brain whirl from the thing -PRON- have hear so incredible -PRON- begin biit the booming sound -PRON- mention -PRON- hear that in leadanfoot 
-PRON- seem so queer though suddenly -PRON- thrust a hand toward marlowe believe -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- want to help 
the other grip -PRON- hand silently then glance up at the sun 
-PRON- have perhaps four hour -PRON- say rise 
hunter too jump to -PRON- foot and for a moment -PRON- look together up the dark side of kerachan hill 
presently the two man be forge steadily up that hillside 
-PRON- speak little and -PRON- face be set draw 
the sun be fall ever more swiftly toward the west and always -PRON- eye measure the distance between that descend sun and the horizon 
by the time -PRON- surmount the first rough height and begin -PRON- progress up the thinlywoode upper half of the hill the gray veil of twilight be already obscure the surround country 
over peak and valley over forest and grassy field lie a strange silence ominous foreboding 
as -PRON- toil up toward the summit through the thickening dusk -PRON- seem to hunter that the whole world be silent breathless tensely wait omplete darkness have fall when marlowe turn and make a caution gesture 
-PRON- be very near the summit now -PRON- tell hunter in a whisper 
for sake go quietly 
together -PRON- creep upward through thick underbrush and over jagged rock until -PRON- crouch at the edge of the smooth grassy space that be the hill summit 
this summit be not exactly level but slope down from -PRON- in a slight grade and at -PRON- center hunter see the black yawning hole marlowe have mention the pit that hold the sandgrain 
marlowe be tug at -PRON- sleeve 
powell down at the other edge -PRON- whisper excitedly 
glance down to that farther edge of the summit hunter see there a thin spare figure dimly outline against the star the figure of a man who be gaze silently at the twinkling light of a distant village 
and over to -PRON- right at the very edge of the bare summit be the rough dark mass that -PRON- know must be the small cabin 
again marlowe twitch -PRON- sleeve 
-PRON- must rush -PRON- from both side -PRON- tell hunter 
-PRON- crawl around the right side of the summit and i will take the left and when -PRON- get near enough go for -PRON- give -PRON- time to get that cone out 
with a whisper good luck -PRON- wring hand and begin to creep stealthily around the left edge of the hilltop 
-PRON- heart pound violently hunter creep forward on the right side toward the man at the summit edge who still stand motionless watch the distant light 
hunter wonder where marlowe be in the darkness 
by now -PRON- be crawl past the open door of the cabin keep close within the shadow of the little building 
from that point -PRON- could glimpse in the starlight the profile of the man -PRON- stalk 
a strong mad face -PRON- be with burn eye beneath a mass of gleam irongray hair a face that be turn toward the south and -PRON- distant light as though fascinate by -PRON- 
suddenly powell laugh and at the unexpected sound hunter stop short on hand and knee 
a bitter mocking laughter -PRON- be that sicken the listening student 
as -PRON- cease the man at the hill edge raise a clench fist and shake -PRON- at the distant light 
and -PRON- voice ring out over the silent hilltop like the note of a warning bell man take heed 
even while powell voice that cry of hate and menace hunter move forward again 
and at -PRON- first movement -PRON- knee press down on a small stick that break with the sound of a pistolshot 
instantly powell turn -PRON- hand flash down to -PRON- pocket and emerge with a small object in -PRON- grasp 
as hunter gather -PRON- for a swift desperate spring that object glow out a tiny circle of luminous green and the young student sink back to the ground deprive of all power of motion by the paralyzing cone 
powell advanced toward -PRON- hold the cone outstretche 
so -PRON- escape marlowe -PRON- say and hunter realize that in the darkness the man have mistake -PRON- for -PRON- former prisoner 
powell be speak on think that stop -PRON- interference now for good 
not that i have any personal animus against -PRON- i assure -PRON- but i canot allow -PRON- to disrupt the plan i have make 
as -PRON- say this mockingly -PRON- carefully place the cone on a small mound of earth so that -PRON- ray still hold hunter paralyze 
then -PRON- straighten and be reach for the pistol at -PRON- belt when a dark figure spring from behind dash -PRON- to earth 
marlowe the thought beat through hunter s brain as -PRON- lie unable to twitch a muscle watch the combat of those two figure that reel about strike kick twisting 
but what be that what 
that thin humming that suddenly make -PRON- hear that grow to a droning to a rumble reverberating thunder 
out of the pit a dark shape be drift up a black disk that grow grow grow 
boom 
boom 
boom 
-PRON- grow until -PRON- have attain a diameter of thirty foot then hover above the pit near the struggle man 
as -PRON- glimpse -PRON- marlowe cry out despairingly and mad laughter fling up 
and now be a sudden stir at the edge of the hovering disk a flurry of movement there 
hunt darkly glimpse shape that crowd about the disk edge that peer at the struggle man 
do -PRON- mistake the two as a menace to -PRON- do -PRON- fail to recognise powell 
for even as the two man reel in battle toward the disk a blind shaft of blue light stab out from the disk edge and strike the struggle pair 
under that ray and in -PRON- light hunter see the face of the two man change horribly stiffen draw crack and over -PRON- sweep a breath of utter cold an icy little wind that seem to freeze -PRON- blood 
an instant -PRON- see powell and marlowe thus staggering reeling fall then -PRON- have collapse to a shapeless heap on the ground and the blue ray strike out past -PRON- have touch the glow cone on the little mound which instantly explode with a flash of light release hunter from -PRON- prisone power 
the blue ray be sweep in a eirele about the hilltop now and with sudden frantie fear -PRON- crawl through the open door of the dark cabin crouch in a comer of -PRON- fearfully 
suddenly the ray sweep up to the cabin and beneath -PRON- touch the glass of the window crack instantly 
an icy puff of air again sweep over hunter in -PRON- corner as the ray sweep through the open door and hang steady for a moment 
-PRON- blue light illumine a little metal stove opposite the door a stove that cover instantly with a lime of frost and ice at the ray touch 
a moment the ray hang thus steadily doubtfully then abruptly vanish as though snap out 
hunter sigh chokingly 
the humming sound begin again outside and -PRON- fear master by curiosity -PRON- creep to the crack window 
a mass of tiny black circle be rise from the pit float up and grow at the same time while the first disk hang to one side watch 
the black circle rise high expand almost instantly to the size of the first be join by that first disk 
for a minute hunter watch the disk circle above swirl about in an eddying mass 
then three detach from those above and sink down to the hilltop hovering close above -PRON- and sweep -PRON- ever and again with the deadly blue ray that eame and go across the cabin while -PRON- watch 
the other disk more than a score in number group in a compact formation then race swiftly south 
the vanguard of the atomic conqueror loose at last upon the world of man tt be doubtful if -PRON- shall ever know the exact purpose of that first raid on the atomic invader 
that question may be solve if -PRON- know how much information -PRON- have receive from powell regard -PRON- earth 
as -PRON- be -PRON- look on that first come as an effort not so much to destroy as to disorganize to terrorize 
doubtless -PRON- be -PRON- plan to break up all chance of organized opposition in england by a series of swift and deadly blow then take over the island at -PRON- leisure and make -PRON- the base of -PRON- future operation 
whatever -PRON- intention -PRON- pass over all northern england without stop and the world first become aware of -PRON- presence when -PRON- strike with terrific force at manchester and liverpool successively 
there be no clear coherent account of -PRON- come to manchester 
the survivor see that hour of dread through a haze of terror and -PRON- be long before all account be piece together to make a reasonably complete story of the happening there 
one see through those horrorstricken tale a terror descend without warn out of the darkness on the unsuspecting city beneath 
no doubt the street be crowd and theater and showwindow ablaze all the life and stir of early evening 
then a swift gathering of dark shape above the deadly blue ray hash down on the street sear in icy path of death across the city 
-PRON- must have be utterly incomprehensible destruction to those below 
even now -PRON- scarcely understand the nature of that blue ray the cold ray as -PRON- be now call 
-PRON- know that all thing in -PRON- path act as if under the influence of extreme unheardof cold absolute ero 
-PRON- be exactly as if the invader have concentrate utter cold and burl -PRON- forth in a single stabbing ray 
strictly speak of course there be no such thing as positive old only absence of heat 
the heory generally accept now be that in some unexplained manner the ray bad the power of instantly suck away the heat of anything -PRON- touch 
certain -PRON- be that the ray be a terrible weapon 
beneath -PRON- flesh and blood freeze immediately into black hard lump metal crack tree and plant shrivel instantly 
-PRON- be curious to note that the action of the ray be highly localize that -PRON- could slay one man hile another man ten foot away would feel only a sudden breath of intense cold 
as -PRON- sweep steadily along the street of manchester that night overtake the flee crowd and leave -PRON- in shapeless heap -PRON- must have seem like the very day of doom to those below 
-PRON- speak of -PRON- as endure for hour that time that the invader hang above the city while in reality the disk remain over manchester somewhat less than twenty minute 
how many avere slay in that time -PRON- be impossible to guess 
the city at least be throw into a wild intense panic and no doubt that be the purpose of the invader 
that accomplish -PRON- gather together and speed away to the west to liverpool 
the story of the massacre at liverpool be almost identical with that at manchester 
there too the disk strike down with icy death at the city but one curious feature differentiate the liverpool account 
-PRON- seem that as the cold ray sweep around the city -PRON- cross ever and again the city harbor and the sea outside 
and for many day afterward immense iceberg of unprecedented size range the english coast bear of that striking of the ocean by the blue ray 
at manchester and liverpool and even as far south as birmingham the invader come down without warn strike unexpectedly spread death and dread then race away 
but some time before -PRON- reach london word of the attack on the northern city have be receive and man wait ready for battlfe so that -PRON- be over london that the atomic people and the force of man clash for the first time 
-PRON- be the assumption of the war office in london that manchester and liverpool have be attack by the airplane of some continental power without the formality of a declaration of war 
certainly -PRON- do not dream of the real nature of the menace that be speed toward -PRON- 
presently from all the airstation around the city plane after plane be spiral up while in a great ring around london the giant searchlight stab the night sweep the sky in search of the invader 
even while the plane ascend and hang in a thin line high above the eity thunder be growl low and ominous and lightning flicker across the sky 
-PRON- be with this gathering storm that the disk race down toward the city never glimpse the line of plane above 
for a space of minute -PRON- hang motionless survey the shine splendid metropolis 
the street below temporarily desert beneath the come storm be like brilliant river of light connect the lake of luminescence that be the square 
one imagine the invader in the disk stare down at the city in amazement if -PRON- reptilian nature possess the power 
as -PRON- hang there the beam of one of the questing searchlight catch -PRON- and hold -PRON- and the stab ray of the other light shift to -PRON- at once bathe the disk in a flood of white light 
then from high above the airplane drive down upon -PRON- and the battle have begin 
one can see that battle clear perhaps through the eye of a single individual a certain young brownell who be the pilot of a singleseat combat plane 
at the first order -PRON- have take the air almost joyously with the exciting thought that at last -PRON- training be to be test in actual battle 
-PRON- thrill to the thought as with the other plane -PRON- swoop down upon the disk 
down -PRON- go and down dive toward a single disk that hang at some distance from the mass of -PRON- fellow 
-PRON- hand grasp the control of the plane machinegun and even above the roar of the motor -PRON- hear the of the gun spray bullet on the disk 
-PRON- sweep down onto that disk and over -PRON- in a great curve pass above -PRON- at a height of a few yard 
as -PRON- flash over -PRON- the lightning flare out blindingly above and as -PRON- catch momentary sight of the thing on the disk -PRON- hand tremble on the control 
-PRON- have glimpse a mass of upturned head scale and peak with fanged and gape mouth 
for the first time -PRON- see the creature of dread -PRON- be fight 
as -PRON- drive up above the battle and bank and circle for another swoop -PRON- hand be still tremble 
from below come the popping of bomb a few of which score hit on the disk most of which plunge down toward the city below miss 
the roar of -PRON- detonation seem feeble beside the crash of the thunder which be now rumble forth almost continuously 
away to the left of the battle two plane collide and drop swiftly to earth trail long streamer of red flame blaze comet plunge earthward through the upper darkness 
and now -PRON- first shock of surprize over the invader strike back and the blue ray flash up search out and find the plane whose wing shrivel and collapse beneath -PRON- touch 
two of the disk have be force down by lucky hit with bomb but the other be almost unscathed and now the plane be fall ever more rapidly beneath the cold ray 
suddenly from high above a single plane rush down toward the mass disk in a dizzying nosedive 
the blue ray stab up from a dozen disk to meet -PRON- but -PRON- plunge on smash down into one of the disk and plane and disk whirl together down to earth the latter spill out a mass of grotesque figure that race -PRON- in -PRON- fall 
brownell shout hoarsely as -PRON- see 
from all around plane be dive down now smash squarely into the disk and fall with -PRON- a deliberate heroic suicide on the part of -PRON- pilot 
an immense exaltation run through brownell that vast forceful rapture of heroism that can sweep man up to titanic height 
-PRON- circle again then dip the plane nose sharply and rush down upon a single disk like a fall plummet at the last m6ment -PRON- cling to the guncontrol 
rush of wind past -PRON- flash of light a roaring in -PRON- ear the disk be nearer rush swiftly up to -PRON- nearer near crash then plane and disk be tumble down to earth together speedingdown to the brilliant street below crash down near the dock where something in the wrecked disk explode with stunning force 
above the battle be all but finish 
only a few of the plane remain and the blue ray be search these out one by one 
presently the invader hold the air alone nine disk remain of the twenty or more that have begin the attack 
the city below be at -PRON- mercy but -PRON- do not heed -PRON- 
circle and form -PRON- mass again together then move away to the north seemingly daunt by the fierce and unexpected resistance -PRON- have meet 
-PRON- have conquer but at a price that disincline -PRON- for further battle at that time 
the people in the city below wait tensely but no more aerial wreck whirl down upon -PRON- 
and the everquesting searchlight reveal no sign of plane or disk over the city 
through all london reign a deathlike silence that first moment of astounded silence before the hoarse roar of fear and rage that would roll through the city 
only the deep rumble of thunder break the stillness 
across the sky the lightning flare again once twice 
then down upon the city sweep the lashing flooding rain 
i be to young story that one must turn again for an account of the invader movement after that first raid 
crouch by the window -PRON- see -PRON- return from the battle nine scarred disk return where more than a score have go out 
for the first time -PRON- strike -PRON- that possibly the force of man may have check the first rush of the invader 
-PRON- wonder intensely as to that 
during all of that period of hour while the disk have be fight and kill and terrorize england -PRON- have not dare to escape from the cabin for the three guardian disk still hang very low above the hilltop and the blue ray constantly sweep about that summit mark a path of death 
the guardian be takingno chance of anyone tamper with the sandgrain of do harm to -PRON- own world that lie within that grain 
and now when the defeat nine return -PRON- see that -PRON- chance of escape be even less 
for except for one disk that drop down into the pit dwindle and vanish these return disk take up a position with the watchful three hovering low over the hilltop 
now and then one would sweep up into the sky cixcle for a time then return to -PRON- position over the summit of hunter wonder intensely what the mission of the disk that return into the sandgrain have be 
a call for aid for reinforcement 
the wait attitude of the other seem to indicate that 
dawn have come and with -PRON- gray light -PRON- move silently about the little cabin find food in plenty and bolt a hasty uncooked meal then return to -PRON- position of observation by the window 
all over the world that day be wonder 
the news of the battle over london of the death that smote the northern city have flash out over all the earth bring surprize and doubt and fear to city far away 
a wave of terror roll over the british isle and already the channel be crowd with the shipping that bear away the first great crowd of the impending exodus 
the theory of attack by a foreign power have collapse and as man examine the crush mangle body find in the wreckage of the disk at london -PRON- realize that earth be invade by creature wholly diffeient from man but superior in power 
-PRON- be but natural that -PRON- should conceive these invader as arrive from another planet and that be the theory hold by all 
in every mind be the thought that the invader have retire only temporarily that -PRON- would return to spread terror and death again 
the disk have be discover hover watchfully over kerachan hill and from all the country about that hill the inhabitant pour forth choke the road in -PRON- frantic haste to escape from the vicinity 
by evening of that day less than twentyfour hour after the first coming of the disk -PRON- be doubtful if a single living person with the exception of hunter remain within ten mile of the hill 
-PRON- strike one as curious that the invader during all that day make no effort to destroy or kill in that vicinity 
-PRON- simply hang above the hill hover and circle restlessly wait as -PRON- seem to hunter 
wait -PRON- think for the return of the messenger who have go back down into the atomic world 
once only -PRON- strike late in the day 
a force of field artillery have be order down from glasgow with order to shell the hill that be evidently the base of the invader 
man and gun and horse rattle south along the rough road under the hot afternoon sun 
high above -PRON- a black speck suddenly appear in the blue the shape of a watch disk that sweep down to investigate 
a few ineffectual rifleshot be fire as the disk sink down toward -PRON- then there be a bolting of man into the neighboring field and hedge a plunging of panicmaddene horse as the dark shape loom above 
then the frosty blue cold ray spring down from the disk leap swiftly along the road in a trail of icy death pursuing and exterminate the run man in the field 
a moment the disk hover and turn then sweep swiftly back up into the blue 
no man in that battery return to glasgow to report -PRON- fate and when three plane be order south to investigate none return 
thereafter no more such futile attempt be make 
that night there be utter darkness in every city in england for strict order be give and enforce that no spark of light should betray a citys presence to the invader 
but though in all england europe america anxious people wait through the night for news of another attack the disk of the invader still hover above kerachan hill wait wait 
in southern england masse of aircraft collect the combine airpower of england and france await180 e the invader return 
and through the english road meet and pass the seabound masse of refugee roll the tank the gun the long brown masse of marchingsoldier 
mankind be gather -PRON- for the straggle but through all those masse run an unspoken think an unvoiced fear 
what avail be rifle and bomb against the smiting ray 
or airplane and dirgible against the swift and mighty disk 
on a hilltop mile away from keraehan man lie hide with powerful telescope and radiotransmitter ready to flash word of the invader movement to all the earth 
and all the earth wait tensely for that word ondere hope fear 
the bright morning of that day pass the second since the first night raid of the invader 
and all through that morning no word come from the hidden watcher 
two hour of the afternoon have pass when a message finally come short concise 
-PRON- say only disk be gather in immense force above kerachan hill and be evidently prepare to move 
that message short as -PRON- be be sufficient to cause the last stable form of life in england to break up melt away 
those crowd of people who have remain hope against hope now fight -PRON- way madly toward the seacoast to escape to life 
over those flee horde run a shout a threat a warning 
-PRON- be come 
-PRON- call -PRON- to one another auto race through country village shout -PRON- the mob on the road voice -PRON- fearfully soldier rest by the wayside repeat -PRON- thoughtfully look toward the north 
over england over europe over the whole world -PRON- run swiftly terribly -PRON- be come 
-PRON- arc come a now the last great hour of destiny be swiftly close down with that massing of the invader above the scottish hill 
crouch beside the window of the cabin hunter watch -PRON- pour up from the pit from -PRON- atomic world masse of tiny disk that grow with inconceivable speed to full size that move away and make room for the other to rise 
up up up gigantic masse of the disk countless horde of the monster -PRON- hold a vast force of invader before which all human resistance would be vain -PRON- know 
after that night of the invader first attack on earth that night of -PRON- imprisoning in the cabin -PRON- have watch through a day and another night and now well into this day except for a few hour of sleep that -PRON- have snatch 
watch wait fearful of the everpresent guardian disk above like -PRON- wait wait 
and now this flood of the disk this upspringing of all -PRON- mighty force 
as -PRON- gaze at -PRON- now float up from the pit in dark endless masse -PRON- seem to -PRON- that the malignant spirit of powell laugh again beside -PRON- 
boom 
boom 
boom 
the rumble thunder of the expand disk seem to -PRON- like the sound of a mighty bell toll the end of the reign of man 
boom boom boom -PRON- glance up see the hundred of disk above spread out in a long double line in an irresistible formation await the other that be still rise from the pit 
but as hunter watch -PRON- circle and form above the sky seem to darken suddenly the sunlight to be cut off to vanish 
and along the line of invader above run a quick start a sudden nervous shock 
dark and darker grow the sky continue on page vhe for this piece of work -PRON- be no longer hangman and jailer say queen elizabeth and there be indignation in -PRON- voice rom -PRON- early memory as a small child i have hate cat 
-PRON- fill -PRON- with an indescribable feeling of dread and horror that amotmts almost to an illness in -PRON- presence 
snake i can bear and of all other animal i be fond but eat to -PRON- be creature most loathsome 
mrs flynn -PRON- landlady have a gray cat with a yellow spot on -PRON- head as though the devil have brand -PRON- servant with brimstone before send -PRON- into the world 
such have always be -PRON- fancy of mrs flynn s cat 
but then i be queer 
-PRON- friend certain of -PRON- apologize for -PRON- as queer 
i have some fame as a writer of story and -PRON- forgive -PRON- -PRON- queerness on that score 
-PRON- name be govern ariste a queer name 
i have queer fancy and i number among -PRON- friend those friend who do not apologize for -PRON- queer people 
such a friend be amir das who do not laugh at -PRON- hatred of cat nor think -PRON- queer because of -PRON- 
for everything in the world -PRON- friend there be a reason this amir das who be a hindoo philosopher have often tell -PRON- 
tonight -PRON- discuss the matter again over -PRON- tea 
amir da -PRON- should be mention be a graduate of oxford where -PRON- acquire an english fondness for afternoon tea 
when -PRON- appear at -PRON- room before oclock of an afternoon and this be the time -PRON- most often choose for -PRON- visit -PRON- be mrs oflynn -PRON- who step in and brew the cheering beverage for -PRON- after the manner that only one bring up in the ould counthry can 
as i have say the hindoo continue for everything in this world or any other world there be a reason 
that be the law of all nature 
for every cause there be an effect 
for every effect there have be a cause place -PRON- hand in that fire which flame on -PRON- hearth 
-PRON- burn -PRON- and i take -PRON- hand away 
never will i put -PRON- hand in fire again 
-PRON- have hurt -PRON- and i fear -PRON- 
cause have produce effect 
do -PRON- desire knowledge 
-PRON- must ever seek to know the cause of the effect -PRON- see 
now this fear this horror -PRON- have for cat when -PRON- be a baby a small child perhaps a cat frighten -PRON- 
-PRON- mother say not but that i cry at sight of one even before i could talk i tell -PRON- 
and -PRON- have always love cat 
-PRON- have five of the animal as pet at the time of -PRON- birth but even as a baby i show such sign of fright at -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- every one away 
-PRON- never have a cat afterward and -PRON- dislike of the creature continue as i grow old 
then -PRON- friend -PRON- feeling for these animal be the unconscious remembrance of another life 
sometime somewhere misfortune come to -PRON- in the guise of a cat 
-PRON- people of the east know these thing to be true 
but -PRON- of the west with -PRON- numerous school and -PRON- much education laugh at the thought that the soul may live through many life come into different body and act different drama but learn each time a little bit more of that which -PRON- have will to learn and work all these experience into one perfect plot in the end 
-PRON- laugh although daily -PRON- see about -PRON- proof of the truth of these thing which -PRON- people have teach and know for age 
a man be introduce to a maiden and with the meeting of -PRON- eye -PRON- know that -PRON- be the one among all other for whom -PRON- have be seek 
and -PRON- too meet -PRON- ardent glance for the soul look out through the eye know that -PRON- be the man of -PRON- heart 
recognition leap like a flash of electric flame between -PRON- 
-PRON- of the west term -PRON- love at first sight but -PRON- of the east say love not at first sight but love for each other many time in many life have be the joy of that man and that maid 
and insofar as -PRON- have love truly in the past -PRON- seek for and find the beloved again 
do not -PRON- scripture say love be strong than the grave 
then have i not meet the one i love in the past i tell -PRON- 
many life must i have love -PRON- alone for i have always be content to be a bachelor and no woman have ever appear to -PRON- as desirable above all other woman 
but -PRON- be speak of cat not love -PRON- friend 
-PRON- speak of reincarnation the chapter of life reply the hindoo 
and -PRON- hatred of cat ariste be doubtless part of a chapter now past a chapter perhaps -PRON- be happy for not remember 
after some further talk of the same nature but more deeply philosophical amir das leave -PRON- to ponder -PRON- statement in the cozy firelight of the oldfashione fireplace 
this fireplace together with mrs ability have keep -PRON- for many month a contented lodger in the warmhearte house in spite of the detestable cat that -PRON- insist on keep 
the fiendish voice of this cat i now hear wail from a distant part of the house 
i presume that probably -PRON- have be lock into some room as -PRON- accompany mrs oflynn a prowling shadow on one of -PRON- busy housewifely round 
i watch the red fire on the hearth and thought of what -PRON- hindoo friend have say 
i think of love and of eat and hold -PRON- mind still while i look at the dancing flame i try to bring out of -PRON- memory some reason for -PRON- hatred of eat 
i must have doze for i start up from -PRON- seat confused and somewhat dazed 
as one who recall the dim memory of a dream i remember that i be govern ariste a writer of story who live in the memory of dream dim as one wake and so do the memory of govern ariste slip into the inaccessible place of -PRON- consciousness 
but what matter 
peter byfield poor young student in london town have long be give to dream 
i laugh at -PRON- somewhat grimly to find that i have be entertain but one more fantastic fancy 
ay peter didst thou not dream so mueh more wouldst thou accomplish i scoff to -PRON- 
have live for many year alone i have acquire the habit of lonesome people who talk with -PRON- in lieu of well or bad company 
the fire on the hearth be almost dead and i stoop to place upon -PRON- another fagot 
then i look at the small pile of unbumed fagot by the hearthside wonder how long -PRON- would last to keep some of the chill of london rain and fog out of -PRON- attic room 
more fagot mean money of which i have but little store 
the hearth be of roughly cut stone and the attic room be humbly furnish with eot and chair and in one corner a table on which be strange crucible and retort and above -PRON- a shelf whereon be book and manuscript 
but however humble -PRON- room -PRON- contain all the mystery of life for -PRON- save only one 
that one i have meet some day past in the queen hunting park where unlawfully i seek for herb and rock that would help -PRON- in -PRON- study of alchemy 
i have come upon this arch mystery of all in an open space between the tree dismount beside -PRON- horse 
in -PRON- hand -PRON- nurse a falcon with a broken wing 
-PRON- be a tiny thing with redgold curl and in one cheek be a dimple that a man may not look upon overlong without a mad desire to kiss -PRON- who shoxdd have flee because i break the law by be in this place at all stand transfix look with heart and eye at the vision before -PRON- 
then the maiden turn raise -PRON- gaze to -PRON- and i see that -PRON- eye be of a blue like that of the sea on a calm summer afternoon 
but more have -PRON- than color 
-PRON- give the man that look into -PRON- a feeling of rest and harbor such as a voyager may have when after a long and eary journey to many port -PRON- come at last home 
as i look into -PRON- eye and -PRON- into -PRON- i know not only that this be the most beautiful woman i have ever see but that -PRON- be -PRON- true love and that i could never care for any other forgot that although ambitious and the son of a noble father be but a poor student who may scarcely dare to love a high lady such as -PRON- appearance proclaim -PRON- to be 
true -PRON- study be of alchemy and should i find the philosopher s stone in which man of that day believe and foi which -PRON- spend longyear of study and search i would have all power at -PRON- command 
-PRON- father have be a noble of henry couit but have displease the king and be force to fine england 
an adventurer -PRON- have journey in many far country where -PRON- have study strange science with stranger teacher among -PRON- the moorish teacher of araby in one of these foreign land i know know not where nor of what mother i have be bom 
and -PRON- have bring back to england with -PRON- in -PRON- old age along with the small boy that be a marvelous collection of book and manuscript 
some of these -PRON- have teach -PRON- to read 
for other -PRON- have give -PRON- a clue to the inner meaning -PRON- contain 
and for all -PRON- have inspire in -PRON- the thirst to understand a thirst that have continue with -PRON- unquenched after -PRON- death several year previously 
something i know of the philosopher stone by which base metal such as lead may be transmute to gold and by which old man have -PRON- old age renew as youth 
and for this philosopher stone i become one of the searcher hope with -PRON- experiment and the knowledge contain in -PRON- precious book that i may some day find the miracleworke talisman 
thus have -PRON- room with -PRON- crucible retort book and potion among which i daily experiment contain all the mystery of life for -PRON- until the day i meet in the royal park the lady edith este attendant to -PRON- majesty queen elizabeth 
then have peter by field take back to -PRON- attic with the injure falcon whose wing i have promise to try to cure the great and sweet mystery of all a mystery that pulse in -PRON- heart like a song and that bring between -PRON- eye and the book i would fain have study vision of golden curl a magic dimple and eye like blue pooli of heaven 
the last mystery bid fair to put to rout and take the place of all the other mystery whose solution i have so long seek 
in -PRON- study of alchemy i do not boast but say truly i have learn more of physic than many physician of -PRON- time 
-PRON- thus happen that on the day i awake from -PRON- strange dream of a life in which -PRON- name be govern ariste i find the injure falcon apparently recover 
with all the skill that i possess i have wind strip of cloth to bind the wing to the bird body until the broken bone could grow together again 
i have keep the restless falcon quiet by have -PRON- hood all that time 
now i remove the hood and the bird fly about -PRON- room with wing but slightly stiff 
i have make good -PRON- promise to the lady este that i could cure -PRON- pet 
exultant that i have serve -PRON- beloved in even so small a thing i catch the bird hood -PRON- again and chain -PRON- to -PRON- wrist 
then i go forth to seek -PRON- mistress 
-PRON- have tell -PRON- that i could ask for a certain servant at the palace who in turn would call -PRON- 
this i do and shortly find -PRON- again in that radiant presence 
doff -PRON- cap i bow low in the fashion of a courtier 
-PRON- tongue false friend have leave -PRON- 
as at that other meeting in the park i could say but a few stiff word the while i tell -PRON- of how -PRON- have be -PRON- great pleasure to cure so fine a bird 
-PRON- have a purse in -PRON- hand but -PRON- courtly manner must have make -PRON- know that i be no hireling to be pay with a gift of money 
instead -PRON- give -PRON- a more precious gift the memory of -PRON- smile as -PRON- thank -PRON- with gracious word 
and have reflect well on the difference in station between a great court lady and a poor student hasten to excuse -PRON- lest i forget and throw -PRON- at -PRON- foot declare the passion i feel 
neither at the time -PRON- have find -PRON- in the park nor now do -PRON- make reference to the fact that -PRON- have be unlawful for -PRON- to wander in the royal hunting preserve 
but any fear i may have have that -PRON- would make know -PRON- discovery of -PRON- presence there have be forget from the first glimpse of -PRON- 
even prison or punishment be well worth endure for the that have become -PRON- 
so i muse as i turn -PRON- step from the palace toward the poor tenement that hold -PRON- attic room 
in such a frame of mind -PRON- be that i come upon young tom smythe the jailer son and the cat that -PRON- torture as sport for -PRON- companion 
-PRON- be a gray cat which later i discover have a sulfurcolore patch upon -PRON- head 
but at the time i see only the manner in which young tom have tie the animal stretch out on -PRON- back with -PRON- four foot draw by cord to four stake so that the boy may draw and quarter -PRON- even as -PRON- father tom the hangman have that day execute a poor wretch sentence to be draw and quarter for treason to the crown 
around young tom have gather a crowd of admire youngster 
tom with a knife who know where small boy obtain the instrument for -PRON- devilment have raise -PRON- arm for the first stroke that would slit the cat body lengthwise 
meanwhile the animal yowl in an agony that but add to the glee of the spectator 
surely the memory of govern ariste be far from the thought of peter byfield for peter byfield on that day do not hate eat 
i love -PRON- as i do all other animal and the sight of the torment creature before -PRON- fill -PRON- with a great pity and a great rage at the young fiend who have undertake this cruelty 
with two stride i have part the surprize child and seize the knife from the wouldbe executioner 
four stroke i make with -PRON- at the bind rope and the gray cat with a yellow spot upon -PRON- head bound from the earth as only a frightened cat can and hiske up the roof of the near house to live eight more life fate favor 
even then all may have be well have not the rage of -PRON- heart demand vengeance upon the person of the young rascal 
the boy be a bully the leader of all the lad of the neighborhood but now i humble -PRON- before the eye of -PRON- frightened playmate 
right lustily i lay onto -PRON- hold -PRON- across -PRON- knee with one hand and apply stout stroke with the other until -PRON- wail as loud as the cat have do 
nor do i heed nor care that a black hatred be bear in the blubbering bullys mind when finally i release -PRON- 
with short word i tell -PRON- what measure i would take should i again find -PRON- illtreate a cat or any other animal 
then weary and -PRON- thought once more turn to the vision of the lady edith este i seek -PRON- lodging determine to work with renew effort in -PRON- search for the philosopher stone that mean wealth and fame and perchance the winning of -PRON- love 
late that night i work measure and mix new potion that may lead -PRON- to the elixir of life 
as i bend to -PRON- task i be startle by a wail cry from the roof of an adjoin house upon which -PRON- attic window look out 
i open the window and a cat spring into the room 
-PRON- be a gray cat with a yellow spot upon -PRON- head a most vile and draggledappeare eat and -PRON- cry to -PRON- with plaintive insistence which bespeak -PRON- opinion that a life save even a cat life as worth little unless that life may have food and shelter 
i give the beast some of the gruel and milk that form -PRON- simple supper 
-PRON- eat and curl up on the hearth purring and content 
such be the manner in which peter byfield come to make a companion and pet of the gray cat the day and age when peter byfield rescue the gray eat man hold many superstition 
-PRON- be not well even in that england which be then come to birth as a great nation and which allow more freedom of thought and action to -PRON- inhabitant than any other country for a man to be too markedly different from -PRON- neighbor 
those who study alchemy may well be careful that -PRON- be not accuse in the popular mind as pursue other and unsanctified study 
young tom smythe whom peter byfield hold over -PRON- knee and beat on the day the youth try to draw and quarter the gray cat chance to fall ill of a colic the week after that episode 
young tom have tell -PRON- father who be the chief hangman of london town of the treatment accord -PRON- by the alchemist 
the eld tom although a brutal evil fellow who could and do on occasion beat -PRON- son most cruelly yet in this case resent the fact that a stranger have take upon -PRON- this parental task 
-PRON- resent furthermore that the stranger have do this for so simple a cause as anger at the innocent boyish sport of execute a stray cat 
tom the elder when -PRON- hear the story curse that stranger and swear that -PRON- would have revenge upon -PRON- 
when young tom fall ill after -PRON- have feast uninvited of green apple steal from a private garden an ugly thought raise -PRON- in the brain of -PRON- father 
young tom -PRON- may be say have tell no one of the green apple 
only a few day before -PRON- have be the hangman pleasant duty to officiate at the last event in the life of a poor old woman accuse by -PRON- neighbor of witchcraft and of cause a sickness among some child in -PRON- neighboihood 
the wretched creature have be try torture and confess under the torture have be condemn to die as a witch 
tom senior have carry out the torture which have make the victim admit -PRON- guilt and -PRON- have fall to -PRON- nothing loth to tie the frantic woman to the stake and pile and light the fagot that destroy -PRON- body and presumably carry -PRON- soul back to -PRON- master in -PRON- flaming pit 
now a cunning train of thought build -PRON- up in mind 
a man of more or less mystery a student of strange thing whom all -PRON- neighbor know to spend long hour in brew unknown compound for what devilish purpose no one know have recently show anger against the hangman child 
more -PRON- have beat that child and threaten -PRON- and the lad have fall ill shortly afterward 
this surely as the working of sorcery and the deed of one who have sell -PRON- to the devil 
to verify -PRON- suspicion the eld tom who live not far from the lodging of peter byfield make inquiry among the neighbor of the alchemist nor as -PRON- adverse to start strange rumor about the student 
then -PRON- be that those who know the alchemist begin to spread queer tale of the man 
-PRON- recall that this peter byfield spend much time alone in -PRON- attic room to which -PRON- seldom if ever invite guest 
-PRON- be rumor that the room contain strange thing crucible retort and drug all the paraphernalia for make a witch s brew 
-PRON- remember that the alchemist have never be overneighborly although -PRON- have be know to do such deed of charity as to give bread to the hungry lie have even bestow money on those in need 
doubtless a man who be the servant of satan could easily make bread by black magic or even produce money by -PRON- sorcery 
-PRON- be know that -PRON- have magically cure a falcon with a broken wing which -PRON- have be see bring home one day almost dead and have later take away with -PRON- apparently sound 
those whom peter byfield have help in -PRON- need now begin to pray god that -PRON- have not take aid from a servant of the devil or have do so innocently that this would not be account a sin to -PRON- 
-PRON- begin to watch this man of mystery 
and then -PRON- be that -PRON- discover damn and erowne proof of -PRON- suspicion 
peter byfield -PRON- be learn have as companion a cat a gray cat with a yellow spot upon -PRON- head verily the cat that the alchemist have rescue from the hand of young tom smythe 
this solve the matter completely and make the evidence conclusive 
why else would a man take pain to save a eat from death be that cat not -PRON- familiar -PRON- demon companion 
tom the elder seek the judge a friend of -PRON- to whom -PRON- tell -PRON- suspicion and the hearsay evidence -PRON- have gather 
of all these thing meanwhile be peter byfield happily ignorant 
but the young alchemist undertake more diligently than ever the study that -PRON- seek to master spur on by the vision in -PRON- lonesome young heart the vision of the beautiful lady edith este 
a nd so -PRON- chance on a day not more than two week after the day on which i rescue the cat that peter byfield unaware of the evil plot against -PRON- by the hangman have -PRON- experiment rudely interrupt by the entrance into -PRON- attic room of four armed man of the law 
without ceremony i find -PRON- arrest and carry to jail accuse of one of the most serious charge of the day witchcraft 
the gray cat repose before -PRON- hearth in all the purr content of a wellfed animal be take as proof against -PRON- 
tom the elder who be among the man that arrest -PRON- have cunningly provide a sack for the cat and -PRON- have be the triumph of young tom now somewhat recover from -PRON- sickness to capture the animal and throw -PRON- into the bag 
i find -PRON- in a dark dungeon and in a most perilous position for of all the crime at that time recognize by law witchcraft be account especially heinous and have as -PRON- punishment the most terrible form of death 
likewise -PRON- be the most difficult charge of all from which a man could vindicate -PRON- a man under suspicion of be a sorcerer may be and be torture in the most brutal manner to obtain a confession 
if -PRON- do not confess -PRON- lay -PRON- liable to conviction for that verv reason as be protect by -PRON- master the devil 
the law deal hardly with person accuse of witchcraft all of which i know 
even the image of the maid with the blue eye the golden curl and kissinvite dimple fade from -PRON- thought though still hold deep in -PRON- heart as the realization of -PRON- plight come upon -PRON- 
-PRON- fear be wellfounde 
when i refuse to acknowledge guilt of the crime of which i be accuse the ignorant cruel judge urge on by the brutal hangman order -PRON- to be torture until i should confess such guilt 
first -PRON- prick -PRON- with needle to find if i have on -PRON- anywhere the invulnerable spot 
this be the spot suppose to be without feeling where have be seal by -PRON- master the devil 
when this torture fail -PRON- flesh ever quiver at the needle thrust -PRON- put -PRON- on the rack 
however peter byfield use the strength of -PRON- will and refuse to confess -PRON- guilty of that of which i be innocent 
i deny that the sickness of young tom have be the result of any evil work on -PRON- part 
i admit that i be a student of alchemy seek the philosopher stone 
but i maintain that i seek this stone not for -PRON- alone but for the good i may do with -PRON- to mankind 
as proof of -PRON- honest intention i point out the charitable deed i have do to those in need 
-PRON- rescue of the gray cat i explain have be because of -PRON- love for dumb creature 
but a judge and accuser who could authorize and witness such torture of a human being as the torture to which i be put could not understand one whose plea be that -PRON- have save an animal from suffer 
-PRON- give -PRON- respite from the rack and seek other mean of make -PRON- confess 
and then -PRON- be that the genius of tom the hangman invent a torture more diabolical than satan -PRON- -PRON- would seem could have devise attention have be call to the sack which hold the gray cat by continued and frenzied caterwauling on the part of that animal which the jailer brutal kick do not still 
put -PRON- hand within the sack -PRON- seek to bring forth -PRON- companion in guilt and misery 
the cat have sharp claw and tom have be well scratch before -PRON- finally give up the attempt and retie the creature in the bag 
then there have flash into -PRON- mind the fiendish scheme for an excruciating torture on -PRON- the cat master peter byfield and the gray cat should be tie into a sack as fellow 
so may this sorcerer own familiar spirit of evil be use to bring about the man ruin 
tom tell -PRON- plan to the judge who immediately see -PRON- possibility and order -PRON- execution 
thus i find -PRON- strip and tie from the neck down in a huge sack and with -PRON- as companion the gray cat craze and frantic now ready to claw -PRON- erstwhile master as though indeed -PRON- be a demon 
this sack be then tie by rope to post so that -PRON- hang hammockfashion while tom the hangman swing -PRON- turn -PRON- first face down and then on -PRON- back as -PRON- prod the cat with a rod to keep -PRON- ever movingin -PRON- clawing frenzy 
horror of horror beyond the power of word to tell 
the agony of that torture 
the scream pain as the sharp claws tear -PRON- body already so brutally torture and rack 
the human body can stand much but the human nerve have a limit of endurance 
and as peter byfield have a sensitiveness of nerve ahead of -PRON- day 
otherwise i would not have have the sympathy that have make -PRON- stoop to free a torment cat in the street 
the tearing of that cat claw on -PRON- bare body be now the most frightful torture that human say rather satanical ingenuity could have devise 
by will almost more than human i fight with -PRON- that i should not confess to a crime i have not commit 
then do i beg of -PRON- torturer that -PRON- put -PRON- to death for death even death by the fire and stake appear to -PRON- as a haven of rest and peace 
and at last finding that i would not confess -PRON- free -PRON- from the sack 
the judge be loth to condemn without a confession but since -PRON- appear that this could not be taine lie deliberate weightily and finally give -PRON- as -PRON- opinion that there be sufficient criminal evidence for conviction 
the very fact that i have not confess the judge aver be due to the hardening of -PRON- heart and will through strength give -PRON- in -PRON- hour of trial by -PRON- unholy master 
so upon -PRON- -PRON- pronounce sentence that i should on the follow day at high noon lie burn at the stake as a warning to other witch wizard and sorcerer 
with -PRON- condemn to share -PRON- fate be the gray eat 
the judge have note the yellow spot on the creature head and with the logie of the day have make -PRON- another link in the chain of evidence that lead to -PRON- undoing 
this yellow spot be doubtless a smokespot of brimstone say the judge which have leave -PRON- mark upon the cat when the creature come from the bottomless pit 
fit indeed that the flame should return -PRON- thither 
i hear -PRON- death sentence as a boon grant in mercy by heaven 
then i be take back to -PRON- rude dungeon to suffer a night of pain from -PRON- broken and bleed body and from -PRON- heart which say that never again should i stand in the bright glory of a may morning and see -PRON- as i have first see -PRON- the fair dear lady of -PRON- heart 
i be a gray tomorrow that follow that gray day of torture 
as noon approach i be lead to the place of execution a public square avhile a ribald crowd follow and hoot -PRON- adjure -PRON- to call upon -PRON- master the devil to save -PRON- from death 
tom the hangman as to have -PRON- final triumph for -PRON- -PRON- be who chain -PRON- to the iron stake 
at -PRON- foot -PRON- tether by another chain the brimstonespotte cat now somewhat subdue by torment 
high about -PRON- -PRON- pile fagot and then everything be ready approach with -PRON- light torch while on -PRON- surly face be the smile of a fiend 
grimly i shut -PRON- eye and pray to the god of love in whom i have believe until that yesterday of torture that -PRON- may give -PRON- strength to die as befit the son of a noble father 
surely the hangman have light the fagot by now or be -PRON- hold baek to prolong -PRON- agony 
i wait to feel the breath of the flame 
almost i think -PRON- body would not shrink from -PRON- warm embrace but would welcome -PRON- fiery kiss of death as set free a soul prisone in a body that have be a dungeon of terror 
and then perchance -PRON- be a delusion bear of -PRON- weakness and pain i hear a voice speak stay -PRON- executioner 
-PRON- be a voice with a clear sweet tone such a voiee as an angel may have but in -PRON- be command that would not be deny 
stay -PRON- command 
what be this -PRON- do and hy be this poor man so condemn the gruff voiee of the hangman answer be a wizard -PRON- ladyship 
-PRON- cast a spell upon -PRON- child who would have perish of a strange sickness have -PRON- not find this man and put -PRON- here where shortly the flame will take -PRON- back to -PRON- master satan and -PRON- vile cat with -PRON- 
be there a cat ask the voiee 
let -PRON- see this animal 
tis beneath the fagot -PRON- ladyship would see -PRON- i say 
there be a rustle as tom move the fagot and perceive that this must be more than delusion i open -PRON- eye to see what person have dare interfere with the course of the law and whom -PRON- be the hangman obey 
i gaze into the face of an angel indeed 
little -PRON- be with redgold curl and a dimple in one cheek that a man may not look upon without a mad desire to kiss -PRON- 
and -PRON- eye in the blue of -PRON- like the blue of the sea on a calm summer afternoon there be rest and harbor for a man soul 
but more than that there be such a flame of pity and indignation that i know what i have almost doubt that a god of love still reign in a dark age and that there be one human being in the world besides -PRON- who would understand the kindness i have do a cat 
to the lady of the curl and eye of blue tom the langman hold out the cat the while tell the story of peter byfield wizard and -PRON- familiar who possess this animal 
the lady listen look at the condemn man but the horror that show in -PRON- face at the recital be at the hangman story of peter suffering rather than horror of the sorcerer -PRON- 
then a strange thing happen 
the girl stretch forth -PRON- hand as though -PRON- would pet the cat and when the jailer would have remonstrate command -PRON- haughtily and take the halfdead animal in -PRON- hand 
as if by magic the torment beast cease -PRON- struggle and raise -PRON- head seek with evident fondness for the stroke caress of -PRON- finger 
another voice a deep mellow voice albeit that of a woman speak 
be careful -PRON- lady edith -PRON- chide or this hangman will accuse -PRON- also of witchcraft when -PRON- so easily charm servant 
do -PRON- look -PRON- majesty reply the girl 
-PRON- be the cat that -PRON- rescue in the royal park a halfyear ago see here be the brown spot upon -PRON- head 
remember -PRON- not how the dog have the animal at bay and how -PRON- turn and face -PRON- so pluckily 
-PRON- and the earl of leicester and i come upon -PRON- and the earl make quip of the fact that this cat wear upon -PRON- head hair of the color of -PRON- hair that denote in -PRON- possessor unconquerable spirit as spanish galleon so lately sink off -PRON- coast bear witness for unconquerable queen do remember the happening reply the second voice 
-PRON- take the cat and make of -PRON- -PRON- pet but -PRON- have be lose some day now as -PRON- say 
with effort i turn -PRON- eye for a minute from the fair face that hold -PRON- so adoringly enthral 
then i see that the other speaker be a woman of most royal presence 
no need to note the color of the hair which virgin queen have make the fashion of court lady no need to hear the tiny address -PRON- as -PRON- majesty 
i know that i stand before elizabeth queen of england and that by miracle a chance have open that may give -PRON- -PRON- life 
mercy in the name of god mercy -PRON- majesty 
i cry 
if this be -PRON- cat then do not let -PRON- kill -PRON- for have save -PRON- life 
-PRON- accuse -PRON- as a dealer in witchcraft but as god be -PRON- witness i have do no wrong 
i but save this cat from the hand of the son of this vile hangman 
the boy would have kill -PRON- most cruelly have i not take the beast from -PRON- 
of the lad illness i know nothing and api guiltless 
be the boy yet ill ask the queen turn to the hangman 
-PRON- be most ill -PRON- majesty say the man somewhat sullenly though now -PRON- seem recover 
but who can say how long -PRON- may stay thus sound if -PRON- be under the spell of a wizard 
this man be not a wizard 
nor would -PRON- hurt any lad -PRON- majesty 
on that i would pledge -PRON- soul say the lady edith now step forward guilty confess -PRON- crime and -PRON- have not so do 
nay -PRON- would not say the hangman 
the devil give -PRON- strength to stand even the torture of be in the sack with the cat 
then -PRON- tell -PRON- with evil glee of the fiendish torment -PRON- have devise 
the small ladyinwaiting who have since first -PRON- gaze meet her comfort -PRON- with -PRON- blue eye of pity shudder at the recital even more than -PRON- have before 
-PRON- turn so white i think -PRON- would swoon 
ah 
-PRON- majesty -PRON- again plead as the jailer finish -PRON- recital man could not hurt a lad 
-PRON- -PRON- be who heal -PRON- pet falcon of -PRON- broken wing 
do -PRON- not recall how i tell -PRON- of -PRON- 
give -PRON- -PRON- story -PRON- man command the queen 
i remember the falcon and chide the lady edith that -PRON- do not bring -PRON- to -PRON- presence for a fitting reward of -PRON- skill 
so commanded i tell -PRON- all -PRON- story how i have study alchemy and physic that would teach -PRON- to heal a sick bird how i have rescue the cat how the animal have come to -PRON- for shelter and how tom the hangman son have fall ill of colic during green apple season -PRON- father have wrongly accuse -PRON- of witchcraft and evil practise against the lad 
then i tell -PRON- of the torture i have endure but that i have not confess even when -PRON- put -PRON- in the sack with the cat 
the lady edith este shudder again and again during the narrative of -PRON- torture but the queen listen quietly 
however there be indignation in -PRON- voice as -PRON- ask at the end of -PRON- story what judge condemn -PRON- 
and how come -PRON- to practise on -PRON- a torture not in accordance with -PRON- law 
-PRON- shall go haidly with this judge and with -PRON- too man -PRON- add address the hangman 
for this piece of work -PRON- be no longer hangman and jailer but must earn -PRON- living by other mean than such zealous practise of cruelty on gentleman 
-PRON- be indeed a gentleman son -PRON- query -PRON- 
i reply that i be and tell -PRON- -PRON- father history make much of the fact that come back to england in the beginning of -PRON- reign -PRON- have ever be a loyal adherent of the crown 
as i talk the lady edith este continue to pet the gray cat now quite calmed 
then -PRON- turn beseech eye upon the queen beseech eye that win from -PRON- sovereign a smile 
so sweet be -PRON- little lady that -PRON- may even woo favor from member of -PRON- own sex 
now -PRON- seem that the queen have listen to -PRON- pleading and make judgment thereby 
serious and grievous wrong have be do to peter byfield say the queen be convinced that -PRON- be an innocent man and therefore i pardon -PRON- fully and freely 
unloose the man -PRON- command the hangman 
faint and weak i have almost fall when tom sullen albeit abash release -PRON- 
a soldier from the queen retinue support -PRON- while -PRON- majesty command that i be take to the palace for treatment by -PRON- court physician 
-PRON- shall make -PRON- physician to -PRON- animal -PRON- announce 
and perchance if -PRON- find -PRON- story true and -PRON- worthy -PRON- shall restore -PRON- to -PRON- father rank and title 
what think -PRON- of that -PRON- lady edith 
will that be reward sufficient for this wonderful doctor of -PRON- of whom -PRON- have talk so much since the day -PRON- mend -PRON- falcon iving 
brace -PRON- against -PRON- faintness i turn to make thank to the lady edith who have save -PRON- life 
and i see in the blush on -PRON- cheek which have follow the queen word a hope that perchance there should be even great reward for -PRON- than the queen have mention 
i reach forward to raise the small ladys hand to -PRON- lip 
-PRON- lie upon the cat that -PRON- have be pet 
i touch the animal as i do so and at that touch there rise in -PRON- such an abhorrence such a dread and loathing and hatred for this creature through which i have suffer so much that i stagger back in -PRON- weakness 
i remember fall fall and then oure and don t start so mr ariste i m but come in to clear away the tea thing 
so speak the voice of -PRON- landlady mrs flynn wake -PRON- from a strange dream that govern ariste have have a dream wherein i play a role under the name and being of peter byfield a dream of such vividness that -PRON- do not depart as most dream do but remain with -PRON- clear distinct in every detail 
be that -PRON- cat that be howl so mrs flynn i ask 
-PRON- be and -PRON- may kape on -PRON- howling for all of -PRON- reply -PRON- landlady 
-PRON- try to eat up -PRON- lovely new singer canary and lock the ungrateful baste up for a lesson to -PRON- not to jump on the cage of tindollar bird 
i know -PRON- donot like the animal mr ariste nor any eat 
but -PRON- really a good crayture and kill many a mouse 
mouse be well enough but when -PRON- bring about the death of a man i reflect but aloud i merely announce -PRON- intention of stroll forth for a walk 
i feel that i need the calm effect of the cold night air 
many story i have write 
writing be -PRON- trade 
but never before have i live -PRON- plot as i have tonight 
be -PRON- merely a fantastic idea for a story that have come to -PRON- i wonder 
or have govern ariste once live in the body of peter byficld 
have peter byfield be a real person 
-PRON- have be a real enough experience those several day in the life of the young alchemist that i have live through during the halfhour between the going of amir das and the coming of mrs oflynn while govern ariste sleep in -PRON- chair before the open fire and mrs flynn s gray cat yowl -PRON- penance for the attempt massacre of a tindollar canary 
what a tale -PRON- would make 
but i must turn -PRON- over in -PRON- mind and clear -PRON- thought 
i walk down the hall and step outside close the door on a last despairing ail from the imprisoned cat 
the thought eame to -PRON- that i may be lose -PRON- mind 
people sometimes do 
perhaps i be have hallucination or -PRON- may be that -PRON- friend amir das have hypnotize -PRON- and send -PRON- this dream to make -PRON- believe -PRON- strange theory of reincarnation 
such be -PRON- thought as i walk i know not where 
suddenly -PRON- revery be break by a woman shrill scream 
i pause and look up a side street whence the cry seem to come 
there be the sound of run step and a girl fling -PRON- upon -PRON- almost into -PRON- arm 
help -PRON- help -PRON- -PRON- cry 
behind -PRON- come two man of rough appearance 
i be not tall and i suppose i do not look formidable 
the man do not stop but continue continue on page martin leahy the story so far ilton rhode and -PRON- friend bill carter go to mount rainier to find out what cause the dreadful murder that be suppose to have be commit by a frightful demon in custody of an angel so -PRON- be describe by those who see -PRON- 
rhode suddenly disappear when -PRON- and carter be among the tamahnowis rock and carter be startle by a fearful scream that seem to issue from the very heart of the rock scream cease as suddenly as -PRON- have come 
i draw -PRON- revolver snap on the electric light and stooping low look into that spot where a few moment w before milton rhode have so suddenly and mysteriously disappear 
nothing but the unbroken rock before -PRON- 
and yet rhode have vanish 
i turn the light full upon the low roof and then i exclaim aloud the entrance be there i drop to -PRON- hand and knee and move under the pack not a little impede -PRON- movement 
an instant and i be stand upright peer into a high narrow tunnel which some convulsion of nature in some lose age of the earth have rent right through the live rock 
nothing be to be see save the broken wall floor and roof deep eery shadow crawl and glide as the light move 
the view however be a very restricted one for the gallery which slope gently upward give a sudden turn at a distance of only thirty foot or so 
what await -PRON- somewhere beyond that turn 
for a few moment i listen intently 
not the faint sound nothing but the loud beating of -PRON- heart 
what have happen to rhode 
milton 
i call softly 
oh milton 
no answer come 
i grasp a projection of rock draw -PRON- up into the tunnel and advanced as rapidly and silently as possible the light and the alpenstock in -PRON- left hand the revolver in the right 
but -PRON- be not very silently what with the creeper 
at time -PRON- grate harshly -PRON- be as if spirit thing be mock -PRON- with suppress demoniacal laughter 
yet i could not pause to remove those grate shoe of toothe steel 
every second may be precious now 
i draw near the turn the revolver thrust forward in readiness for instant action 
i reach -PRON- and there just beyond a dark figure be stand frame in a blaze of light 
-PRON- be milton rhode 
-PRON- turn -PRON- head and i see a smile move athwart -PRON- feature 
well -PRON- have find -PRON- bill say be 
i be now draw near to -PRON- 
that scream i say 
who give that terrible scream 
terrible 
-PRON- didnot sound terrible to -PRON- say milton rhode 
fact be bill like to hear -PRON- again 
what on earth be -PRON- talk about 
tis so 
who be -PRON- 
or what be -PRON- 
why the angel -PRON- tell -PRON- 
where be -PRON- now 
go bill -PRON- s go 
when -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- fetch up give that scream then turn and vanish around that next turn 
what be -PRON- like milton 
i wish i could tell -PRON- but how can a man describe venus 
i know one thing bill if all the daughter of drome be as fair as this one that i see i know where all the movie queen of the future be come from 
i look at -PRON- and i laugh 
wait till -PRON- see -PRON- bill 
complexion like alabaster white as rainier s pure snow 
and hair 
oh that hair bill like ten billion dollar worth of spin gold 
and the demon 
i query didnot see any demon bill 
there be silence for a little space 
then i say the whole thing be true after all 
-PRON- mean what grandfather scranton set down in -PRON- journal and the rest of -PRON- 
i nod never doubt that 
at time i tell -PRON- didnot doubt -PRON- 
then again -PRON- all seem so wild and weird that i didnot know what on earth to think 
i think -PRON- say with a wan smile that -PRON- know what to think now now when -PRON- be stand in this very way to drome whatever drome may be 
yes 
and yet the thing be so strange 
think of -PRON- 
a world of which man have never dream save in the wild romance 
an underground world 
subterranean way subterranean city man and woman there cavernicolous aphrodite say milton rhode 
and all down there in eternal darkness 
i exclaim 
why the thing be incredible 
no wonder that i sometimes find -PRON- wonder if i be not in a dream say milton rhode all that -PRON- see or seem be but a dream within a dream 
but come bill -PRON- add let this a priori stuff bowl -PRON- over 
in the first place -PRON- isnot ark down there when -PRON- get down far enough 
in heaven name how do -PRON- know that why for one thing if this subterranean world be one of unbroken darkness the angel and the demon would be blind like those fish in the mammoth cave 
but -PRON- be no more blind than -PRON- or ergo if for no other reason -PRON- shall find light down there 
of course -PRON- have artificial light or donot mean that 
if there have not be some other illumination this strange race of whose very existence science have never even dream would have cease to exist long ago if indeed -PRON- ever could have begin 
but no gleam of sunlight can ever find -PRON- way to that world 
-PRON- never can of course 
but there be other source of light nebula and comet in the heaven for example and aurora phosphorus and firefly here on earth 
the phenomenon of phosphorescence be by no means so rare as may be imagine 
why as nichcl show though any man who use -PRON- eye can see -PRON- -PRON- there be light inherent even in cloud 
a hh this and more rhode explain to -PRON- succinctly but clearly 
oh well find light bill say -PRON- 
all the same this subterranean world for which -PRON- be bind present some unpleasant possibility in addition that be to those concomitant to -PRON- be a habitat of demon and heaven only know what besides 
and then there be the air i say 
as -PRON- descend -PRON- will become denser and denser until at last wc shall be able to use these icepick on -PRON- 
rhode who be remove -PRON- creeper laugh 
-PRON- will have to make a vertical descent of three and onehalf mile below the level of the sea a vertical descent of near five mile from this spot where -PRON- stand bill before -PRON- reach a pressure of even two atmosphere 
the density then increase rapidly doesn t -PRON- oh yes 
three and a half mile more and -PRON- be under a pressure of fbur atmosphere or about sixty pound to the square inch 
throe and a half mile farther down or ten and onehalf mile in all below the level of the sea and -PRON- have a pressure upon -PRON- of eight atmosphere 
fourteen mile and -PRON- will be sixteen atmosphere 
at thirtyfour mile the air will have the density of water at fortyeight mile -PRON- will be as dense as mercury and at fifty mile -PRON- shall have -PRON- as dense as gold 
that will do i tell -PRON- 
-PRON- can never get down that far 
i have no idea how far -PRON- can go down bill 
-PRON- know that -PRON- could never stand such pressure as those know that 
but as a matter of fact i donot know what the pressure be at those depth 
nor do any other man know 
what i say a moment ago be of course accord to the law but there be something wrong with the law found upon that of mariotte as any physicist will tell -PRON- wrong with -PRON- 
at any rate the law break down as one go upward and i have no doubt that -PRON- will be find to do so as one descend below the level of the sea 
if the density of the atmosphere decrease in a geometrical as the distance from sealevel increase in an arithmetical ratio then at a distance of only one hundred mile up -PRON- should have virtually a perfectvacuum 
the rarity there would be absolutely inconceivable 
for the atmospheric density at that height would be only one billionth of what -PRON- be at the earth s surface 
and what be the real density there no man know or can know reply rhode until -PRON- go up there to see but meteor render incandescent by the resistance -PRON- encounter show that a state of thing exist at that high altitude very different from the one that would be find there if -PRON- formulae be correct and -PRON- theory be valid 
and so i have no doubt -PRON- shall find -PRON- down in drome 
formulae be very well in -PRON- place -PRON- go on but -PRON- should never forget bill that -PRON- be often bud on mere assumption and that a theory be only a theory until experiment or experience have show -PRON- that -PRON- be a fact 
and that remind -PRON- do -PRON- know what percival lowell say about formulae 
i say i didnot 
formulae say the great astronomer be the anesthetic of thought 
i commend that very highly milton add to -PRON- fiction editor and -PRON- writer of short story 
but but -PRON- no but bill say milton 
and hat do -PRON- scientist know about the interior of this old earth -PRON- inhabit anyway forsooth but very little billy -PRON- lad 
why -PRON- donot even know what a volcano be 
one canot make a journey into the interior of the earth on a scratchpad and a leadpencil or if -PRON- do -PRON- may be pardon if -PRON- do not give implicit credence to all that -PRON- choose to tell -PRON- when -PRON- come back 
for instance one of these armchair columbus -PRON- make the journey in a machine call by dx and come out in china say that -PRON- find the interior in a state of igneous fluidity 
and another why -PRON- tell -PRON- that the hole earth be as rigid as steel that -PRON- be solid to the very core 
-PRON- seem say to be a case of great contest follow and much learn dust involve the combatant each claim truth and truth disclaim both 
the truth in this case be not yet know reply rhode though i trust that -PRON- and i bill be fate to learn -PRON- 
-PRON- smile a queer wan smile 
whether -PRON- be fate also to reveal -PRON- to the world -PRON- world well quien sabe say milton rhode 
then i remark -PRON- finger busy remove -PRON- icecreeper what -PRON- read about the state of thing in the interior of the earth the temperature the pressure the density then all that be pure theory of course 
how could -PRON- be anything else 
all theory save that be the mean density of the earth 
and that mean density give -PRON- something to think about for -PRON- be just a little more than twice that of the surface material 
with all this enormous pressure that -PRON- hear so much about and the resultant increase of density with depth the weight of the earth certainly ought to be more than only five and onehalf time that of a globe of equal size compose of nothing but water 
kind of queer all right be -PRON- comment 
-PRON- be queer all right as the old lady say when -PRON- kiss the cow 
however as old dante have -PRON- son -PRON- time ask thrifty use 
as the last word leave -PRON- lip i straighten up the toothed shoe in -PRON- hand and as i do so i start and cry hear that rhode make no answer 
for some moment -PRON- stand there in breathless expectation but that low mysterious sound do not come again 
what be that 
i say wish i know 
-PRON- be faint and well rather strange 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- i tell -PRON- to be hollow like the sound of some great door suddenly close 
-PRON- companion look at -PRON- rather quickly 
think so bill -PRON- say think twa the sound of something fall 
there be a pause during which pause -PRON- stand listen and wait but the gallery remain as silent as though -PRON- have never know the tread of any living thing 
well bill say milton rhode suddenly -PRON- shall never learn what drome mean if -PRON- stay in this spot 
as for the creeper i be go to leave mine here 
milton then write a short note which record little more than -PRON- name the date of -PRON- great discovery and that -PRON- be go farther 
this carefully fold -PRON- place beside the creeper and put a rockfragment upon -PRON- 
i wonder as i watch -PRON- whose would be the eye that would discover -PRON- 
some inhabitant of this underground world of course and to such a one the record would be so much greek 
twa utterly unlikely that anyone from that world which -PRON- be leave would ever see that record 
i wonder if -PRON- should ever see this spot again 
and now bill say milton down -PRON- go 
and the next moment -PRON- be go have begin -PRON- descent into this most mysterious and dreadful place 
scranton come with -PRON- weird story of old -PRON- i be i confess not a little puzzle by -PRON- and reference to the extraordinary scientific possibility that -PRON- present 
at first i could not imagine what on earth -PRON- mean 
but i see all those possibility very clearly now and a thousand more i imagine 
i know a wild joy exultation and yet at the same time the wonder and the mystery of -PRON- all make -PRON- humble and sober of spirit 
i admit too that a fear a fear for which i can find no adequate name have lay -PRON- palsied and cold finger upon -PRON- 
in a few moment -PRON- reach that spot where the angel have vanish 
there -PRON- pause in curiosity look about but nothing be to be see 
the gallery which from this point swing sharply to the right and go down at a rather steep angle be as silent as some interstellar void 
bill smile milton rhode -PRON- be idle who may be better employ 
and -PRON- start on or rather down 
a hundred foot however -PRON- be now under the glacier and -PRON- halt turn -PRON- light full upon the lefthand wall point and say there -PRON- be 
bill the writing on the wall 
i press to -PRON- side and stand stare 
the rock there be as smooth almost as a blackboard and upon -PRON- trace in white chalk be three inscription with what -PRON- take to be name append to -PRON- 
that on the right be clearly a very recent one have be place there doubtless at the most but a few day since by that cavemieolous venus that milton rhode have see for so fleet a moment 
-PRON- be opinion that the character be alphabetical one though at first i be at a loss to understand how -PRON- could be anything to -PRON- but an utter mystery 
the letter be form by straight line only 
the simple character be like a plain capital with the vertical line somewhat elongate 
and -PRON- be make to perform the office of another letter by the simple expedient of stand -PRON- upon -PRON- head 
the number of crossline increase up to six three at the top and three at the bottom and in one or two character there be two vertical line place close together 
evidently observed milton rhode this alphabet be construct on strictly scientific principle 
for a space -PRON- stand there look wonder what be record in that write so strange and yet after all so very and beautifully simple 
then milton proceed to place another record there and as -PRON- write -PRON- hum when i see a person name scratch upon a glass i know -PRON- own a diamond and -PRON- father own an ass 
the inscription finish -PRON- resume -PRON- descent 
the way soon become steep and very difficult 
that aphrodite of your i observe as -PRON- make -PRON- way down a particularly rugge place must have the agility of a mountaingoat 
-PRON- rhetoric bill be horrible 
wait till -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- will never be guilty of thinking of a goat when -PRON- have -PRON- thought 
by the way what kind of a light do the lady have 
light know 
i be so interested in the angel -PRON- that i never once think of the light -PRON- carry 
i don t know that -PRON- need a light anyway 
what on earth be -PRON- talk about why i fancy bill that -PRON- very presence would make even gloomy realm bright and beautiful as the garden of the hesperide 
oh gosh be -PRON- comment 
wait till -PRON- see -PRON- bill probably see -PRON- demon first 
hello exclaim milton 
what now 
look at that say -PRON- point think -PRON- have the explanation of that mysterious sound which -PRON- think be like that of a great door suddenly close in -PRON- descent -PRON- dislodge a rockfragment and that sound -PRON- hear must have be produce by the mass as -PRON- go plunge down 
tis very likely but great heaven -PRON- exclaim 
what be -PRON- now wonder bill if -PRON- lose -PRON- footing here and go plunge down too 
i have not think of that 
and the possibility that that lovely and mysterious being lie somewhere down there crush and bleed perhaps lifeless make -PRON- feel very sad 
-PRON- send the ray of -PRON- powerful light down into the silent depth of the tunnel but nothing be visible there save the dark rock and those fearful shadow fearful what with the secret that may be hide there 
the answer wonot come to -PRON- bill say milton 
no i return as -PRON- start down -PRON- must go get -PRON- 
the gallery at this place have an average width of i suppose ten foot and the height would average perhaps fifteen 
the reader must not picture the wall the roof and the floor as smooth however 
the rock be much break in some spot very jagged 
the gallery pitch at an angle of nearly fortyfive degree which will give some idea of the difficulty encounter in the descent 
at length -PRON- reach what may be call the bottom here the tunnel give another turn and the pitch become a gentle slope 
and there -PRON- find -PRON- the rockfragment weighing perhaps two hundred pound that the angel have dislodge in -PRON- descent which doubtless have be a hurry a wild one 
thank heaven i exclaim -PRON- didnot come down with -PRON- 
amen say milton 
then a sudden thought strike -PRON- a thought so unworthy that i do not voice -PRON- aloud 
but to -PRON- i say -PRON- be passible that -PRON- may find -PRON- before -PRON- get out of this wishing that -PRON- have 
if a human be one of the very good of human being even be to voice -PRON- uttermost -PRON- inmost thought what a shameful terrible monster -PRON- would call -PRON- or -PRON- and the demon 
where be -PRON- demon 
i could give no adequate description of those hour that succeed 
steadily -PRON- continue the descent now gentle now steep rugged and difficiilt 
sometimes the way become very narrow indeed at one point -PRON- have to squeeze -PRON- way through so closely clid the wall approach each other then again -PRON- would open out and -PRON- would find -PRON- in a veritable chamber 
and in one of these a lofty place the vault roof a hundred foot or more above -PRON- head -PRON- make a strange discovery a skeleton quasihuman and with wing 
be -PRON- i cry enter inferno -PRON- 
a faint smile touch the face of rhode -PRON- -PRON- ask know what this be 
-PRON- must be the bone of a demon 
precisely 
grandfather scranton -PRON- will remember wound that monster up there by the tamahnowis rock 
undoubtedly the bullet reach a vital spot and these be the creature s bone 
but i object these be human bone a human skeleton with wing 
accord to scranton there be nothing at all human about the appearance of that thing which -PRON- call a demon 
i admit say rhode that this skeleton at the first glance have an appearance remarkably human if that be one can forget the wing 
the skull i believe more than anything else contribute to that effect and yet at a second glance even that lose -PRON- human semblance 
for look at those terrible tooth 
whoever see a human being with tooth like thase 
and look at the large scapula and the small hip and the dwarfish though strong nether limb 
batlikc bill strikingly so 
and those foot -PRON- be talon bill 
and see that medial ridge on the sternum for the attachment of the great pectoral muscle batman then 
i query should say a batape 
or an apebat 
whichever -PRON- prefer smile milton 
well i add at any rate -PRON- have a fair idea now of what a demon be like 
little wonder forsooth that old sklokoyum have declare the thing be a demon from the white man inferno 
and this creature so dreadful well the angel have -PRON- for a companion 
when rhode see -PRON- -PRON- be of course without that terrible attendant undoubtedly the next time though how long would -PRON- be -PRON- would not be alone 
oh well i console -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- revolver 
a ccording to the aneroid this great chamber be about four thousand foot above the level of the sea in other word -PRON- have already make a vertical descent of some four thousand foot 
-PRON- be now about as high above the sea as the snout of the nisqually 
but what be -PRON- direction from the tamahnowis rock 
so sinuous have be this strange subterranean gallery -PRON- orientation have be knock into a cocked hat 
-PRON- be belief however that -PRON- have be move in a northerly direction that -PRON- be still under the peak -PRON- probably under the great emmon glacier 
i confess that i would not have care to place a wager on the subject 
goodness only know where -PRON- be but of one thing there could be no doubt -PRON- be there why i ask -PRON- bring a eomnass think return milton slip loose -PRON- pack and lower -PRON- to the floor that as -PRON- be -PRON- have a case of another straw and the earner back bust take a rest -PRON- twenty minute after and a snack 
and another thing -PRON- wouldnot know whether to trust the compass or not 
why so 
local attraction bill 
many instance of this could be give 
one will suffice 
lieutenant underwood of the wilke explore expedition find a deviation of thirteen and a quarter point on the summit of the cobu rock in the feejee one hundred and fortvnine degree 
the island of nairai be directlv north and yet accord to the compass -PRON- bear one quarter south whilst place at the foot of the rock that very same compass say nairai bore north so -PRON- see that that faithful friend to man and especially to the mariner have in -PRON- friendship some quality that be remarkably human 
still rhode add wish that -PRON- have bring one along 
also -PRON- should have bring a manometer for the aneroid will be worthless after -PRON- have descend below sealevel 
oh well the boiling point of water will give -PRON- the atmospheric pressure under a pressure of two atmosphere water boil at fahrenheit under a pressure of three atmosphere at four atmosphere five six seven eight and so on 
on the summit of rainier -PRON- boil at about wish that -PRON- be head for the summit say eight atmosphere 
when -PRON- reach that pressure if -PRON- ever do well be ten and a half mile below the level of the sea wonot -PRON- 
rhode nod 
accord to the law 
but as i remark there be something wrong with the law 
tis -PRON- belief that -PRON- shall be able to descend much deep than ten and onehalf mile that be that the atmospheric pressure will permit -PRON- to do so 
that qualification i tell -PRON- be very apropos for there be no tell what the inhabitant of this underground world will permit -PRON- to do or will do to -PRON- batape or apebat human or both 
that of course be very true bill 
and say -PRON- wonot need a manometer or -PRON- wonot need to ascertain the boiling point of water to know that the pressure be increase 
-PRON- eardrum will make -PRON- painfully aware of that fact 
when that come swall billy swall and the pain will be no more 
swallow 
swallow milton nod 
great barmecide swallow what swallow the pain bill 
for look -PRON- 
deglutition open the eustachian tube 
some of the dense air enter the drum and counteract the pressure on the outside of the membrane 
-PRON- keep on swallowing 
the air in the drum become as dense as that outside there be no pressure on the membrane now or rather the pressure be in perfect equilibrium and presto and abracadabra the pain be go 
who would have think -PRON- gink say rhode go into compress air have well think -PRON- 
-PRON- may have -PRON- eardrum burst in if -PRON- doesn t 
but why do the eustachian tube open only when -PRON- swallow to shut from the ear the sound produce in the throat and the mouth 
if the tube be always open -PRON- head would be so many bedlam 
wonderful nature 
i exclaim 
oh -PRON- do fairly well admit milton rhode 
and i suppose i say that the pain in the ear experience by those who ascend high mountain be to be explain in the same way only vice versa 
-PRON- too ought to swallow 
of course 
at lofty height the dense air in the drum press the membrane outward 
swallowing permit the dense air to escape 
one swallow until the pressure on the inside equal that of the rarefy outside air and hocuspocus and presto the pain have evaporate hope i say that all -PRON- difficulty will be as easily resolve 
hey cry milton the matter now 
stop swallow that water get food sufficient for a week but -PRON- havenot get water to last a week or anything like -PRON- 
keep up that guzzling and -PRON- canteen will be empty before sunset 
sunset 
sweet pluto 
sunrise sunset or high noon -PRON- all the same here in erebus say that -PRON- very different diyly remaike milton rhode if -PRON- find the finger of thirst at -PRON- throat 
surely there be water in this place somewhere 
most certainly there be 
but -PRON- donot know how far -PRON- be from that somewhere 
and until -PRON- get to -PRON- -PRON- policy bill must be one of watchful conservation 
a silence ensue 
i sink into profound and gloomy meditation 
four thousand foot down 
a mile deeper and where should -PRON- be 
the prospect certainly be from any point of view dark and mysterious enough to satisfy the wild dream of a poe or a dor6 
to imagine a inferno however be one thing and to find -PRON- in -PRON- be quite another 
tis true -PRON- be not in -PRON- yet but -PRON- be on -PRON- way 
i hasten to say though that i have no thought of turn back 
no such thought even the slight be entertain for one single moment 
i do not blink that be all 
i believe -PRON- enterprize be a very dangerous one i believe -PRON- be very probable that -PRON- should never return to the light of the sun 
such thought be not pleasant be indeed horrible 
and yet in the very horror of -PRON- i find a strange fascination 
yes -PRON- may leave -PRON- bone in this underground world in this very gallery even 
even so -PRON- should have -PRON- own exceeding great reward 
for our would be the guerdon of die in a stranger a more wonderful quest than any science or discovery ever have know 
a strange reward and perhaps -PRON- wonder what such a reward can mean to a dying or a dead man 
all i have to say be that if -PRON- do -PRON- know naught of that flame spirit which move the scientist and the discoverer that such as -PRON- should never indeed can never seek the dread secret of nature or journey to -PRON- hidden place rest there for exactly one hour 
the temperature by the way be fahrenheit 
when -PRON- resume the descent i be use the phosphorus lamp instead of the electric one 
-PRON- be not likely that even -PRON- electric light would fail -PRON- still there be no guess what may happen and -PRON- may be well i think to adopt a policy of lightconservation also 
as for the phosphorus lamp these would furnish light for six month 
in this -PRON- be simply wonderful but there be one serious drawback the light emit be a feeble one 
the manufacture of this lamp at one time use i believe in paris and probably elsewhere in the magazine contain explosive be simplicity -PRON- 
into a glass phial be put a small piece of phosphorus 
the phial be fill twothird full of olive oil heat to the boiling point 
the thing be hermetically cork and there -PRON- be 
when -PRON- wish to use -PRON- wonderful little pharo -PRON- simply allow air to enter 
the space above the oil become luminous then 
-PRON- replace the cork and the phial remain seal until there be occasion to restore the waning light which -PRON- do of course by allow more air to enter 
as have be say such a phial will furnish light for a halfyear 
these phial of our be set each in a metal frame and protect by a guard in such fashion that -PRON- would take a heavy blow to break the glass 
when not in use the be keep in strong metal cylinder 
of course the electric light could be turn on at any instant 
there be place where the gallery pitch in a way to make the head swim many spot in which -PRON- have to exercise every caution a false step may have spell irrevocable disaster 
i wonder how the angel have pass down those difficult place and many picture of that mysterious creature as i wonder come and go 
well -PRON- have pass down and that without mishap 
where be -PRON- now 
indeed where be -PRON- -PRON- 
steadily -PRON- toil -PRON- downward way 
for a long distance the gallery run with but slight deviation either to the right or to the left though the descent be much break i mean now be steep and now gentle now at some angle intermediate 
rhode think that -PRON- be now move in an easterly direction -PRON- may have be north east south or west for all i know 
not a trickle of water have -PRON- see not even a single drop which i confess cause some unpleasant thought to flicker through -PRON- mind 
at clock -PRON- be two thousand foot above sealevel at half past about half a thousand 
and -PRON- then decide to call -PRON- a day 
nor be i at all sorry to do so even though -PRON- may be near some strange even great discovery for i be very tired and sore from the top of -PRON- head to the end of -PRON- toe 
i be in fair trim and so be rhode but -PRON- would take -PRON- some time to get use to such work as this 
a very gentle current of air so slight that -PRON- require experiment to detect -PRON- be pass down the gallery 
the temperature here be fahrenheit 
-PRON- have step before a cavity in the wall and in that little chamber -PRON- pass the night one hold watch whilst the other sleep 
-PRON- dream be dreadful but otherwise the night be as peaceful as any that ever pass over eden 
neither rhode nor during that strange eery vigil there in the heart of the live rock hear even the faint most fleeting sound 
as the watcher sit there wait and listen whilst the minute slowly pass -PRON- find -PRON- at any rate i know that i do almost wish that some pulsation would come so heavy and awful be the stillness of the place 
but a sound -PRON- be to hear 
-PRON- have be journey for about an hour and a half and have just pass below sealevel 
in that place rhode have leave the aneroid 
of a sudden milton who be lead the way halt with a low sharp interjection for silence 
when -PRON- look strike -PRON- -PRON- be stand in an attitude of the most rivet attention 
there -PRON- exclaim 
do -PRON- hear that bill 
the air have pulse to the faint sound now all be still again 
what be -PRON- 
i ask -PRON- voice a whisper know bill 
there 
again that gentle pulsation touch the ear and again -PRON- be go 
and a strange thing be that for the life of -PRON- i could not have tell whether -PRON- come from below or from behind ms there -PRON- be again say rhode 
i flash on -PRON- electric light to the full power whisper 
i exclaim 
and great heaven milton 
what now bill -PRON- ask quickly something behind ns 
-PRON- start 
-PRON- turn -PRON- light up the tunnel and for some moment -PRON- stand peer intently 
not a move thing be to be see there however only the move shadow 
again say milton rhode 
but -PRON- isnot a whisper bill 
and -PRON- didnot come from up there 
the thing i tell -PRON- could be hide in shadow not up there -PRON- be ahead 
wherever -PRON- be what on earth can -PRON- be what do -PRON- mean 
that -PRON- shall learn resume -PRON- descent every sense -PRON- may be sure on the qui vive 
the tunnel here incline rather steeply a little space however and the dip be a gentle one 
the sound soon become ono steady unbroken whisper then a dull melancholy murmur 
abruptly rhode stop turn to -PRON- and -PRON- laugh 
know now what -PRON- be bill 
this be not a moment i think for laughter or anything like -PRON- 
sound like the growling of beast i say peer intently down the passage wonder if the angel there be two kind of angel -PRON- know have turn loose a whole pack or flock of those demon 
to -PRON- surprize and astonishment rhode burst into outright laughter 
well say i rather testily 
why all the cachinnation 
forgive -PRON- bill 
but -PRON- isnot a pack of demon or a flock 
how on earth do -PRON- know what -PRON- be water 
water 
yes 
water from missouri better see that -PRON- revolver be handy 
who ever hear water make a shivery sound like that 
-PRON- see though i think that -PRON- will hear first 
ere long there could be no doubt about -PRON- milton be right -PRON- be the sound of fall water 
must be at quite a distance i say sound carry a long way in tube and that be what this tvrnnel be 
steadily -PRON- make -PRON- way along and down and just as steadily the sound increase in volume 
the gallery make several sharp turn and then of a sudden the sound rise from a loud growl to a roar and an exclamation burst from -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible to convey to the reader the eery effect of that sudden strange transition 
one moment -PRON- be in the gallery the next -PRON- have issue from -PRON- and stand in a most tremendous cavern or rather on a ledge or shelf high up on one of the wall of that cavern 
the opposite side be but dimly visible 
the roof sweep across a hundred foot or more above -PRON- head 
and the bottom 
i gaze at the edge of the rock shelf on which stand out and down into that yawn abyss and i feel a shudder run through -PRON- and on through -PRON- heart 
the roar of the fall water come from -PRON- right 
-PRON- turn the ray of -PRON- light in that direction but nothing be visible there save the dark limestone rock and cimmerian blackness 
-PRON- then move to the edge and turn -PRON- light down into those awful depth to depth perhaps never before touch by ray of light since time begin 
far down the beam go plunge and farther still but -PRON- could not see the bottom 
bottom there be however for the water be tumble and growl down there 
i be glad to draw back from the edge and i lean against the rock wall and gaze upon the dark scene in wonder amazement and awe 
rhode join -PRON- 
well what do -PRON- think of -PRON- bill 
milton this be awful 
-PRON- be 
i have never see a sight more strange and terrible 
and the angel 
i query 
what about -PRON- bill 
how on earth do -PRON- make -PRON- way through this awful place 
why along this ledge on which -PRON- be stand 
there be no other way 
i glance along that shelf and i feel very sad get a well head i tell -PRON- than i have 
why didnot -PRON- bring along an airplane 
i wonder if the way lie down or up toward the fall 
-PRON- bend over and examine the rock 
down i observe 
down milton nod 
whilst i stand there ponder this and wonder what be down there in the blackness of that frightful chasm rhode move off to the right and examine the ledge there 
and up too -PRON- announce 
somebody or something or both have go up toward the fall 
great heaven if -PRON- get catch between -PRON- the program be become interesting rhode admit 
for a time -PRON- stand in silence then milton say suggest that -PRON- go up and take a looksee 
i nod 
so far as i could perceive one way be just as good i mean just as bad as the other 
that shelf be as a whole not an easy thing to negotiate and some spot make -PRON- head swim and make -PRON- wish mightily that i be somewhere else 
undoubtedly some thousand of year in the dim and mysterious past the stream once flow at this level at any rate that be the only theory that in -PRON- opinion will explain that ledge and something -PRON- be soon to discover 
not that i ever spend much time in worry about theory and hypothese the fact -PRON- give -PRON- enough to think about enough and to spare 
at time the shelf would be twenty or thirty foot in width or even more and then the go be easy enough but at other time the space would contract to a couple of yard and then -PRON- be another story 
once or twice milton rhode -PRON- an experienced and fearless climber be glad i believe that the way be no narrow 
as for what those moment mean to -PRON- well i never pose as a mountaineer or a steeplejack 
for fifteen minute or so i believe -PRON- toil along that terrible place and then of a sudden come to the end 
nothing before -PRON- but the bare precipitous rocky wall and the black profundity of the chasm and up above a ghostly thing crawling crawling down ever down and fill the place with thunder the fall -PRON- 
where do the water come from 
and a question more interesting where do -PRON- go 
-PRON- must go back say milton rhode 
the road to drome do not lie here 
scarcely have -PRON- turn when i start and then i cry out sharply 
look 
i say point with -PRON- alpenstock down the cavern 
look at that far down the cave a light be gleam where a moment before no light have be 
and on the instant another shone beside -PRON- 
a second or two however and -PRON- have vanish 
move be rhode explanation 
no 
i tell -PRON- 
and look 
again 
there -PRON- be gleam at -PRON- for all the world like the dim and baleful eye of some wait monster ew some moment those yellow eye gleam at -PRON- then vanish 
the lid of that wait monster so to speak have elose over -PRON- 
i have watch -PRON- very closely and i be sure that there have be no movement of the eye -PRON- 
milton however be just as sure that -PRON- have move 
to the right or to the left 
i query 
neither 
down say rhode 
then -PRON- must have be straight down 
-PRON- be behind a rock mass or something 
-PRON- wait watch closely but those yellow eye do not gleam again through that stygian gloom 
must have be at quite a distance i remark at last 
-PRON- seem so bill and that mean that this cavern be very straight for a mile or more or that -PRON- be one of enormous size 
-PRON- may be both 
-PRON- may be 
and -PRON- may be that those light be not so far away as -PRON- appear to be 
one may easily be deceive in such matter 
-PRON- donot know what -PRON- mean i say but -PRON- know this be spot 
oh be see all right bill 
-PRON- every movement will be watch 
some minute pass during which -PRON- stand peer down the cavern and wait but no light gleam forth again 
then -PRON- start back better keep a sharp lookout i say suddenly 
remember a demon doesnot have to come along the ledge have not forget that bill but -PRON- be armed 
as i believe be make sufficiently obvious the crossing of those place where the ledge narrow to the width of but a couple of yard have be no pleasant matter but during the return the thing assume an aspect truly sinister 
that -PRON- be be watch both of -PRON- regard as certain 
that -PRON- may at any moment find a demon or a dozen demon drive at -PRON- well that be a possibility which never leave -PRON- thought for one single second 
and in those narrow place where the ledge contract to a mere ribbon of rock -PRON- be all one want to do to hug the wall and make sure of -PRON- footing 
a frightful place truly in which to meet even with a revolver the attack of even one of those wing monster and -PRON- may find -PRON- attack by a dozen 
-PRON- can easily be imagine then the relief which i feel when -PRON- have pass the last narrow spot though forsooth -PRON- may be go toward something far more terrible than any -PRON- have leave behind -PRON- 
but the angel have go down and where a woman could go there i tell -PRON- in masculine pride could -PRON- also 
that be i subjoin suppose -PRON- do not meet apebat or something more terrible 
at length -PRON- stand once more at the mouth of the gallery 
and scarcely have -PRON- stop there when an unpleasant thing flash into -PRON- thought which as -PRON- be resemble anything but the rainbow 
great heaven 
i cry peer into the tunnel which at the distance of only thirty foot or so give a sudden turn to the right 
something could be in there very close to -PRON- and yet unseen what be -PRON- bill 
could those light that -PRON- see have be here 
be -PRON- wait in there to dog -PRON- step or to do something bad 
rhode peer into the gallery with a curious halfvacuous expression on -PRON- face make no reply 
well i query what do -PRON- think of -PRON- 
-PRON- could not tell where those light be how far away anything donot think that -PRON- be here milton rhode return think -PRON- be much farther down and on the other side on the other side 
how on earth could anyone cross that chasm -PRON- donot know what -PRON- be like down there 
and of course i donot know that the light be on the other side 
but i believe that -PRON- be 
a silence ensue which at length i break what be the next thing on the program make -PRON- way down the ledge 
that be the only way -PRON- can go 
but first -PRON- will try a little finesse 
-PRON- take a position in the mouth of the tunnel one that permit -PRON- to look down the cavern 
-PRON- sign to -PRON- to follow suit and when i stand at -PRON- side -PRON- say off go the light off -PRON- go and the terrible blackness be upon -PRON- 
so terrible be -PRON- and so strange and fearful that place in which -PRON- stand i actually find -PRON- wonder if -PRON- would not all prove a dream 
why i ask at last do -PRON- do this 
to see if the light will show again 
-PRON- may think that -PRON- have lose heart and start back 
i see -PRON- all now instead of -PRON- advance to those mysterious being somewhere down the cavern -PRON- would bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
but -PRON- do not come 
-PRON- do not show even the faint light 
-PRON- wait there for many minute but nothing whatever be see 
hum say rhode at last snapping on -PRON- light wary folk bill these hypogean 
and so i reply have to go to -PRON- 
that s what -PRON- shall have to do 
walk maybe right into a trap 
-PRON- be possible rhode admit 
but -PRON- be possible too that the trap may not prove so terrible possible indeed that there be no trap at all 
i tell -PRON- i certainly would like to see that angel again 
then let go see -PRON- what well do 
and so -PRON- start 
a strange indefinable dread have -PRON- grip upon -PRON- and yet i be anxious to go to put the thing to an issue 
in all probability -PRON- should not have far to travel 
nor in fact do -PRON- 
the way be much like the one that -PRON- have traverse in the opposite direction 
one or two spot be even more dangerous than any -PRON- have find up there 
and over these dangerous terrible place where a false step or a slip of the foot on the smooth rock would have mean a most horrible death along this airy dizzy stygian way the angel have pass 
well -PRON- be a brave angel at any rate 
-PRON- be descend all the while sometimes at an angle that i be glad be no steep 
this do not mean however that -PRON- distance from the bottom of that terrible chasm on -PRON- right be decrease 
the sound that come up from the black depth of -PRON- tell plainly that the descent of tlie stream be as pronounce as that of the ledge -PRON- be follow and perhaps more so 
and here something that i donot understand be -PRON- remark as -PRON- stop in a particularly break spot to say nothing of -PRON- be below sealevel here this stream have be pour down for untold century for how many thousand of year no man can even guess and yet the place isnot full 
where do all the water go think be answer of all the river that for how many million of year no man can tell have be run into the sea and yet the sea be not overflow 
i don t see the application of that to this underground world donot see how all the water there must be more stream than this can possibly return as vapor to the region above admit rhode say that the problem be a formidable one and that with -PRON- present paucity of datum -PRON- can not hope to solve -PRON- 
still i think -PRON- suggestion sound 
but where be the opening to permit the escape of so enonnous for enormous -PRON- must be an amount of water vapor 
there may be countless vent fissure bill way of egress that man will never know 
whatever the explanation there can be no doubt that the ater be go down and that this subterranean world be not full 
but where do -PRON- go 
down to some sunless sea perhaps though if that hypothesis of -PRON- be a sound one bathe in light light never see in that world -PRON- have leave on land or sea 
rhode be a silent for a moment lean on -PRON- alpenstock 
then -PRON- be strange truly the descent of the water 
and yet -PRON- would not i believe have be to -PRON- so very strange a thing have -PRON- know that the sea -PRON- flow into the earth 
the sea -PRON- rhode nod 
surely milton why the thing be jule vemesque 
on the contrary the fact have long be know 
at argostoli in the island of cephalonia the sea flow right into the limestone rock 
shade of lemuel gulliver but this old ball that man call the earth be certainly a strange old sphere how strange say milton rhode no scientist have ever dream though -PRON- scientist have think of thing far strange than the case be certainly not numerous where marine current be know to pour continuously into cavity beneath the surface of th earth but there be at least one wellauthenticate instance of this sort that of the mill stream at argostoli in the island of cephalonia 
-PRON- have be lorn observe that the sea water flow into several rift and cavity in the limestone rock of the coast but the phenomenon have excite litte attention until very recently 
in three of the entrance be close and a regular channel sixteen foot long and thre with a fall of three foot be cut into the mouth of a large cavity 
the sea water flow into this canal and could be follow eighteen or twenty foot beyond -PRON- inner terminus when -PRON- disappear in hole and cleft in the rock 
george marsh man and nature any ever conceive by -PRON- wildest romancer who after all bill be a pretty tame homo have an idea i say glance down the cavern that -PRON- be go to find the homo here in this place anything but tame 
milton laugh and without any other answer turn and resume the descent 
for one thing i be profoundly thankful the wall run along without any pronounced cavity or projection in -PRON- so that -PRON- have little to appiehend from a sudden attack on this -PRON- giddy way except or course by a demon 
have the wall be a broken one any instant may have find -PRON- face to face with a band of hypogean as rhode call the denizen of this subterranean place 
but how long would the wall remain like that 
and after all do -PRON- really greatly matter 
meet sooner or later be inevitable 
tis true i could not conceive of a bad place than this suppose the meeting to be in any measure an unfriendly one 
and from what have happen up there at the tamahnowis rock i could not suppose that -PRON- would be anything else 
this however be to prove simply another instance of how inadequate the imagination when confront with the reality be sometimes find to be for even now -PRON- ere draw near a place more terrible even than this and that be the place where -PRON- meet -PRON- require but little imagination though to make -PRON- aware and painfully so of the extreme probability regard by -PRON- as a certitude that eye be watch -PRON- every movement 
but where be those eye and what be the watcher 
to what fearful thingor could -PRON- be wonderful be -PRON- draw near at every single moment now 
some minute pass perhaps fifteen perhaps more i can not say how long -PRON- be 
of a sudden however rhode who be still lead the way stop 
no sound have escape -PRON- and -PRON- stand there like a statue peer intently straight ahead 
look there -PRON- say in a low voice point with -PRON- alpenstock and tell -PRON- what -PRON- see 
i be already look and already i have see -PRON- 
but what on earth be that thing which i see 
i remain silent gazing with strain eyesand wonder if i really see what i think that i do 
what ask rhode do -PRON- make of -PRON- 
the thing be so faint 
tis impossible and yet if -PRON- be not so i would say that -PRON- be an arch part of a bridge 
just what i think 
the thing be so strange though that i didnot know whether to believe -PRON- eye or not 
and so dim i observe that -PRON- may be nothing of the kind 
a bridge 
now who on earth would build a bridge across this frightful chasm 
and why 
quien sake bill say milton rhode 
the next moment -PRON- be move toward -PRON- 
look ejaculate rhode suddenly 
-PRON- go clear aeross 
yes i say stop and gaze at that strange dim mass -PRON- go clear across 
and that s the place over there on the other side that s where -PRON- be wait for -PRON- shouldnot be a bit surprize say milton a strange bridge that truly 
-PRON- look like a ruin a ruin that have not fall 
-PRON- be a ruin indeed 
so ruinous be -PRON- that i wonder how the mass could possibly remain intact 
a short advance however and the mystery be solve 
the hand of man have not build that great arch across this dreadful chasm nature have fashion -PRON- there in that region of everlaste darkness 
-PRON- have rhode say a remarkable semblance to the celebrate natural bridge in virginia 
a short space and -PRON- stand upon -PRON- gaze across 
-PRON- width here be about sixty foot 
the surface be comparatively speak a smooth one and -PRON- have a rather pronounced slope upward a circumstance by no mean conducive to security of footing 
and a feature that i notice with some unpleasant misgiving be the diminution of width at the farther end 
just how wide -PRON- be there wc could not tell what with the uncertain light that struggle to the spot but -PRON- see enough to know that that way which -PRON- should have to cross be a very narrow one indeed and on either side the black chasm yawn to receive -PRON- 
and just beyond dim and ghostly as though see in a dream stupendous column rise up and be involve in the darkness of the lofty cavern 
what on earth arc those 
i query 
-PRON- remind one of a grecian temple 
limestone pillar no doubt return milton 
and -PRON- there i exclaim -PRON- voice however low and guard that -PRON- be wait for -PRON- that be where those light be 
i suppose so wait until -PRON- get in that curse narrow place and then and then 
well i tell -PRON- -PRON- have better say -PRON- prayer before -PRON- start across 
rhode laugh 
i think though that there be a touch of the sardonic in -PRON- laugh 
little wonder forsooth if twa so for the thing be fraught ith terrible possibility 
what i ask be -PRON- to do 
cross over if -PRON- be permit to do so 
if -PRON- should be permit to do so i gaze into the black profundity of the chasm and feel very sad 
holy gorgon i say -PRON- get into a fine pickle though tell -PRON- what well do bill -PRON- remain here like horatius at the bridge while i explore along the ledge donot like -PRON- i tell -PRON- 
unite -PRON- stand well -PRON- know the rest of -PRON- 
-PRON- be silent for some moment 
then think that -PRON- can risk -PRON- 
bill 
very well i acquiesce shrug -PRON- shoulder 
but i tell -PRON- that i don t like -PRON- at all 
the next moment however -PRON- have turn and as move down the ledge 
i step back to the wall upon which two inscription be trace and wait the result with such composure as i could summon 
at last rhode move behind a projection in the wall 
a moment and the glow of -PRON- light have vanish ne be go and i be alone in that terrible place 
the blackness seem to increase the shadow to thicken about -PRON- and grow denser 
but one sound break the awful silence which sound seem to have a quality tangible crush the growl of the water in the abysmal depth of the chasm 
and even that sound as i stand there listen watch wait seem to change -PRON- seem to sink to a murmur then a whisper as though evil spirit be hush -PRON- to lull -PRON- suspicion and even -PRON- very sense 
what be that 
i start and something shoot through -PRON- very heart chilling and sharp as the needle point of an icicle 
surely i have see -PRON- 
yes there -PRON- be again dim but unmistakable there by one of the great column a single point of light an eye stare at -PRON- with a greenish fire 
yes there -PRON- be 
then of a sudden -PRON- be go 
for a time i stand peer and wait the blood throb in -PRON- ear but -PRON- be not see again 
i turn and look down the ledge and i give an exclamation that be one of relief and joy for there be rhode just come into view around that projection in the wall 
what i ask as -PRON- draw near do -PRON- find down there 
-PRON- canot go down 
the shelf be break nothing but sheer wall between 
so -PRON- across the bridge for -PRON- 
-PRON- may never reach the other side 
and then i tell -PRON- what i have see 
and i ask grandfather scranton say that the eye of the demon burn with a greenish fire 
rhode nod 
of course though -PRON- say light have to reach -PRON- or the eye canot shine 
in absolute darkness -PRON- would not do so 
that eye shine though ghostly for the light that reach that spot be dim 
and so the angel at least and heaven only know what besides be wait there with -PRON- demon 
yes bill there can be no doubt that the eye which -PRON- see belong to a demon 
the prospect be certainly a sinister one i admit 
a silence ensue 
of a sudden rhode raise -PRON- voice and halloo hello there 
the answer come almost on the instant hello there hello there hello there hello hello tis only echo lovely echo smile milton rhode 
again -PRON- raise -PRON- voice and again the word be throw back at -PRON- 
hear that bill -PRON- cry whilst the echo be still sound hear -PRON- that be no echo no i say -PRON- be no echo 
-PRON- wait listen intently but that sound which have come with the echo be not hear again 
rhode draw -PRON- revolver and examine the weapon most carefully 
-PRON- look at -PRON- curiously and then -PRON- say have no desire bill to disguise the fact that this crossing may prove a most a most bill -PRON- may prove -PRON- neednot tell -PRON- say know very well what -PRON- may mean 
but -PRON- canot turn back bill 
no -PRON- canot turn back 
-PRON- reach out -PRON- hand and grasp mine 
and then without another word -PRON- start 
i have know some critical teirible horrible scene in -PRON- life but never anything like the suspense and mystery of those moment that now succeed 
what be -PRON- to see 
what be -PRON- to meet 
and horror of horror -PRON- would be in that place where the bridge narrow to a mere ribbon the frightful depth yawn on each side almost at -PRON- veiy foot 
well at last -PRON- reach -PRON- 
-PRON- head begin to swim so terrible be the place and i have to stop and get a grip upon -PRON- nerve 
rhode too paused and for some moment -PRON- stand there so near to safety and yet the mockery of -PRON- closer than ever to mystery and danger and perhaps horror unnamable 
now for -PRON- bill say rhode 
keep -PRON- revolver ready for instant action 
and -PRON- start across 
the place be so narrow that -PRON- could not think of walk side bv side 
rhode be lead 
and then -PRON- come when -PRON- have take eight or ten step when -PRON- have reach the most dangerous spot on that ribbon of rock 
of a sudden a dark figure strain at -PRON- leash move from behind one of the limestone pillar and two eye shine horribly in the light burn with a greenish fire and the strong ray be flash back in the horrid gleam of tooth 
and beside that demoniac shape a tall figure appear a figure clothe in white the eye wide and blaze the face white as snow and frame in gleam gold which fall in masse about the shoulder a figure majestic indescribably lovely and dreadful 
-PRON- be the angel and -PRON- demon strange weird scene like some terrible vision from the page of dor6 often rise before -PRON- the tall white figure of the angel the dark squatting winged monster before -PRON- and -PRON- two man from the sunlit world stand there upon that narrow way the black profundity of the chasm yawn on either side of -PRON- 
the angel have indeed well choose the moment 
if that hideous apebat strain at -PRON- leash be loose at -PRON- -PRON- position despite -PRON- revolver would be a truly horrible one 
scarce twentyfive foot lie between the monster and -PRON- 
in case of attack -PRON- would have to drop the monster in -PRON- spring and only a lucky shot could do that or the result would be a most disastrous one 
for -PRON- could not meet an attack there to step aside or to meet the demon in a struggle would mean a plunge over the edge 
-PRON- be indeed a critical appalling scene one in which i have no desire to see even -PRON- bad enemy place 
-PRON- fate i think be in the hand of that whiterobe whiteface be whom -PRON- know as the angel 
the dembn however as will be see in a moment be to take the matter in -PRON- own hand if i may use that expression in speaking of that monster for hand the thing have none 
i can easily see how the demon in the obscurity of the fog have seem to old scranton a thing that have no shape 
but here the strong ray of -PRON- light turn full upon the demon the sight be an altogether different one 
and a strange sight surely no man have ever see up there in that world which -PRON- have leave that world so near to -PRON- still and yet -PRON- seem so very far away now 
-PRON- be as though some circe have change -PRON- into figure in some dread story of ancient day 
and this be what man call the twentieth century the golden age of science and discovery 
well science doesnot yet know everything a fact that i be sorry to say some scientist -PRON- be very prone to forget 
heaven say rhode keep -PRON- look fix on those figure before -PRON- -PRON- a wonderful creature 
and -PRON- say an awful thing and i d wait a while before say that -PRON- be wonderful 
-PRON- may prove to be something very different 
the next instant i give a cry 
the demon have make a sudden strain forward 
come a sharp word from the angel and that cerberus sink back again 
but though -PRON- sink back that greenish fire in -PRON- eye seem to burn more fiercely malevolently than before think i suggest -PRON- would be a good plan to move back a little back to a safe a wide spot 
move back 
never say milton rhode 
-PRON- be here to move forward not to go back 
i think this utterly quixotic but of course if -PRON- didnot want to go back i couldnot make -PRON- 
and if -PRON- wouldnot step back neither would look i say 
-PRON- be go to speak 
the angel raise -PRON- left hand and motion to -PRON- rather vehemently at the same time utter some word or word 
no mistake that bill say milton 
no -PRON- be as plain as any word could be go back am at a loss say rhode how to answer 
again the angel raise -PRON- hand but -PRON- do not motion this time for the demon with a bloodcurdling sound deep in -PRON- throat strain forward again and so suddenly and strongly that the angel be draw forward a step or two 
a sharp word however from the angel and the monster settle back as a dog do after strain at -PRON- leash 
once more the angel fix -PRON- eye upon -PRON- or rather upon milton rhode 
once more -PRON- raise -PRON- hand to sign to -PRON- to go back 
but the sign be never give 
at that instant as the angel stand there with upraised hand -PRON- happen 
that sound come again only more horrible than before and the demon spring at -PRON- 
catch thus off -PRON- guard the angel be jerk whirl forward 
there be a wild piercing cry which rise to a scream but the winged monster pay not the slight heed 
-PRON- be as though the thing have go mad 
the angel go down in an instant however -PRON- be up again 
-PRON- scream at the demon but -PRON- lunge toward -PRON- flap -PRON- great hideous wing and drag -PRON- after -PRON- out onto the bridge 
-PRON- position now be one of peril scarcely less than -PRON- own 
all this have pass of course with the quickness of thought 
-PRON- could not fire for fear of hit the angel right behind the demon -PRON- could not move back and -PRON- could not stand there and let this nightmare monster come upon -PRON- 
in a second or two if nothing be do -PRON- could do so 
but what could -PRON- do 
the thought of save -PRON- by kill the woman and the chance be a hundred to one that -PRON- should kill -PRON- if -PRON- fire at the demon be a horrible one 
but to stand there and be send over the edge be horrible too 
and the angel in all probability would be kill anyway that -PRON- have not already be jerk from the rock be nothing less than a miracle 
why didnot -PRON- loose -PRON- hold on the leash these be some of the thing that flash through -PRON- mind yes even then 
i never before know what a rapid thing thought can be 
oh those thing that shoot through -PRON- brain in those brief horrible second 
-PRON- whole life from childhood to that very moment flash before -PRON- liko the film of a cinematograph though with the speed of light 
i wonder what death be like what -PRON- would be like somewhere in the depth of that black gulf 
and i wonder why the angel do not loose -PRON- hold on that leash 
i didnot know that -PRON- have wrap the chain around -PRON- hand and that the chain have in some way get catch 
the poor angel could not free -PRON- little wonder forsooth that -PRON- be scream so fearfully 
-PRON- must risk -PRON- 
i cry 
hold 
the next instant milton rhode have step aside yes step right to the very edge of the rock 
the demon whirl at -PRON- and as -PRON- whirl one of -PRON- great wing strike -PRON- full across the face 
i give -PRON- up for lose but how i keep -PRON- plaoe on that ribbon of rock 
another instant and the monster would be at milton s throat 
but no from this dizzy position which -PRON- have so suddenly take the angel be no longer behind the demon and on the instant rhode fire 
oh that scream which the monster give 
-PRON- strike the rock and that rhode manage to keep -PRON- footing on the edge of that fearful place be one of the most amazing thing that i have ever see 
but keep -PRON- -PRON- do and -PRON- fire again and again 
the demon flap backward jerk the angel to -PRON- knee and near the edge and then suddenly flat on -PRON- face 
the next instant the monster disappear 
-PRON- wing be beat against the rock with a spasmodic hideous sound 
i give a cry of relief and joy but the next moment one of dismay and horror break from -PRON- 
the monster be drag the angel over the edge f ilton rhode throw -PRON- prone on the rock and -PRON- right arm around the angel waist 
quick bill quick -PRON- arm the whole weight of the monster 
-PRON- seream have cease but from -PRON- throat break a moan long tremulous heartrending a sound to shake and rend -PRON- already quiver nerve to enhance most dreadfully the indescribable horror of the scene and the moment 
i could do nothing where i be have to step over the prostrate form which in -PRON- heated imagination be be drag over the edge 
the wing of the demon be still beat against the rock the blow not so strong but more spasmodic the sound a leathery sicken tattoo 
-PRON- will probably be remember that the angel have hold the demon with -PRON- right hand 
i be now on the angel right and stretch out on the rock i reach down over the edge in an effort to free -PRON- from that drag monster the black depth over which -PRON- hang turn -PRON- dizzy and faint 
i now see how the angel have be catch and that -PRON- have be drag so far over the edge that i could not longarme though i be reach the leash 
so i grasp -PRON- arm and with a word of encouragement begin to pull 
slowly -PRON- draw the monster up 
another moment and the chain would be within the reach of -PRON- other hand 
yes there 
steady so 
i have reach down -PRON- other hand -PRON- finger be in the very act of close on the chain when horror i feel -PRON- slip along the smooth rock slip over into that appalling gulf 
to save -PRON- i have to let go the angel arm and as the chain jerk to the monster weight an awful cry break from the angel and from milton rhode and i see -PRON- body drag farther over 
cut -PRON- bill cut -PRON- a chain 
rhode groaned 
-PRON- must try again 
great heaven -PRON- canot let -PRON- be drag over 
this horrible spot make the head swim 
steady bill steady say rhode 
here hold -PRON- while get a grip with -PRON- other arm 
then i will get a hold on -PRON- with -PRON- right all be drag over 
nonsense say rhode 
and besides get a hold with -PRON- foot now in a crack or something 
a few moment and i be again reach down rhode grip upon -PRON- this time 
again i lay hold on the angel arm and again -PRON- and i draw the monster up 
this time though i get -PRON- other hand on the chain 
and yet even then the chain hang slack above -PRON- hand the angel be some time in free -PRON- own from the finger of which blood be drip 
but at last -PRON- have loosen the chain hnd then i let go -PRON- hold upon -PRON- and down the demon go still flap -PRON- wing though feebly now and disappear into those black and fearful depth 
i have no recollection of any sound come up 
undoubtedly a sound come 
little wonder forsooth that i do not hear -PRON- 
a moment and i be back from the edge and milton and i be draw the angel to the safety of that narrow way 
-PRON- sink back in rhode arm -PRON- eye close -PRON- head almost hide in the gleam golden hair on -PRON- shoulder faint say little wonder if -PRON- have bill 
but -PRON- have not 
scarcely have -PRON- speak when -PRON- open -PRON- eye 
at once -PRON- sit tip and i see a faint color suffuse those snowy feature 
well say i to -PRON- whatever else -PRON- may be -PRON- angel be human 
-PRON- remain there for a little while recover from the effect of the horrible scene through which -PRON- have pass then arise and start for that place of safety there amongst the wonderful stupendous limestone pillar 
i be now move in advance and i confess and nothing could more plainly show how badly -PRON- nerve have be shake that i would gladly have cover those few remain yard on all foul if -PRON- pride would have permit -PRON- to do so 
yes there -PRON- stand by that very pillar behind which the angel have wait for -PRON- with -PRON- demon 
there be -PRON- lamp lantern rather dark of course though not extinguish 
i look at -PRON- and look all around 
-PRON- see two light i say 
and yet -PRON- be wait here alone there certainly be two light bill two person at least 
-PRON- companion go somewhere that be the only explanation i can think of wonder where say and what for 
help perhaps 
-PRON- know bill i have an idea that if -PRON- have delay much long -PRON- reception there and -PRON- wave a hand toward the bridge would have be a very different one 
-PRON- be interesting enough to suit -PRON- 
and as -PRON- be heaven only know what be to follow 
the angel stand there straight and still be watch -PRON- intently so strange a look in -PRON- eye those eye be blue that a chill pass through -PRON- heated brain and actually begin to wonder if i be be hypnotize 
hypnotize 
and in this curse spot i turn -PRON- lbok straight into the eye of the angel and as i look i fling a secret curse at that strange weakness of -PRON- and call -PRON- a fool for hay entertain even for a fleeting moment a thought so absurd 
rhode have notice and -PRON- turn -PRON- look upoii -PRON- and upon the woman this creature so indescribably lovely and yet with so indefinable mysterious a sibylline something about -PRON- 
for some moment there be silence 
i think that i see fear in those blue eye of -PRON- but i could not be sure 
that strange look whether one of fear or of something else be not all that i see there but i strove in vain to find a name or a meaning for what i see 
science science 
this be the age of science the age of the airplane the submarine radium television and radio and yet here be a scene to make science -PRON- rub -PRON- eye in amazement a scene that may have be take right out of some wild story or out of some myth of the ancient world 
well that ancient world too have -PRON- science some of which science i fear though this thought would have bring a poohpooh from milton rhode man have lose to -PRON- sorrow 
and like that ancient world so perhaps have this strange underground world which -PRON- have enter or rather be try to enter 
and perhaps of that science or some phase of -PRON- this angel before -PRON- have fearful command 
one moment i tell -PRON- that -PRON- should need all the courage -PRON- possess all the ingenuity and resource of that science of which milton rhode -PRON- be the master the next that i be let -PRON- imagination overleap -PRON- 
-PRON- thought be suddenly break by the voice of milton 
goodness bill look at -PRON- hand i forget -PRON- step toward the angel and gently lift -PRON- blooddripping hand 
the chain have sink right into the soft wrist 
the angel however with a smile and a movement with -PRON- left hand give -PRON- to understand that the hurt be nothing 
the next moment -PRON- give an exclamation and gaze past -PRON- down the pillare cavern 
instantly i turn and as i do so i too exclaim 
there far off amongst the column two yellow wrathful light be gleam and dark hurrying figure be move toward -PRON- help be come bill say a milton rhode 
and that remind -PRON- i haven t reload -PRON- revolver would lose no time in do so i tell -PRON- 
-PRON- get out the weapon and proceed to reload -PRON- 
-PRON- be not by the way one of these newfangled thing but one of -PRON- good oldfashione revolver solid substantial one that would stand hard usage a piece to be depend upon 
and that be what -PRON- need weapon to be depend upon 
the angel be watch rhode closely 
i wonder if -PRON- know what have kill -PRON- demon know i mean that this metal thing with -PRON- glitter so dull and so cold be a weapon 
-PRON- be extremely unlikely that -PRON- have in that horrible moment on the bridge see what actually have happen 
however that may have be -PRON- be soon plain that -PRON- recognize the revolver as a weapon or at any rate guess that -PRON- be 
with an interjection -PRON- step to rhode side and with swift pantomime -PRON- assure -PRON- that there be nothing at all to apprehend from those advance figure 
after all milton say slip the revolver into -PRON- pocket why should -PRON- be so infernally suspicious 
maybe this world be very different from -PRON- own 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- i tell -PRON- -PRON- right hand in that pocket which contain -PRON- revolver that -PRON- have good cause to be suspicious 
have -PRON- forget what grandfather scranton see up there at the tamahnowis rock and what -PRON- didnot see and the horrible death there of rhoda dillingham to say nothing of what happen to -PRON- here a few minute ago 
that -PRON- be not at the bottom of that chasm well i be not anxious to have another shave like that have not forget bill 
i have an idea though that those awful tragedy up there be purely accidental 
certainly -PRON- know that the demon attack upon -PRON- be entirely so 
accidental 
great scott some consolation that look at milton rhode and i look at the angel who have take a few step forward and be await those hurry figure a whiterobe figure still and tall one lovely majestic 
and if i didnot sigh i certainly feel like do so demon there bill observed milton at last -PRON- eye upon those advance form 
i see none 
four figure 
four nod rhode 
two man and two woman 
a few moment and -PRON- step out into a sort of aisle amongst the great limestone pillar 
the figure in advance come to an abrupt halt 
an exclamation break from -PRON- and echo and reecho eerily through the vast and gloomy cavern 
-PRON- be answer by the angel and as -PRON- voice come murmur back to -PRON- -PRON- be as though fairy be hide amongst the column and be answer -PRON- 
but there be nothing fairylike in the aspect of that leader who be advance again or -PRON- male companion 
that aspect be grim formidable 
each carry a powerful bow and have an arrow fit to the string and at the left side a short heavy sword 
that aspect of -PRON- undergo a remarkable metamorphosis however as -PRON- come on toward -PRON- what with the explanation that -PRON- angel give -PRON- 
when -PRON- at last halt a few yard from the spot where -PRON- stand every sign of hostility have vanish 
-PRON- be patent however that -PRON- be wary suspicious 
that -PRON- should be so be not at all strange but just the same there be something in -PRON- manner that i could not understand something that make -PRON- resolve to be on -PRON- guard whatever may betide 
the leader be a tall man of sinewy and powerful frame 
though -PRON- have i judge pass the halfcentury mark -PRON- have suffer -PRON- seem no loss of youthful vitality or strength 
-PRON- companion tall and almost as powerful as -PRON- be a much young man in -PRON- early twenty 
-PRON- golden hair be bob for all the world like -PRON- truly bobbified flapper 
the arm be bare as ere the leg from midway the thigh to below the knee the nether extremity be incase in buskin light but evidently of excellent material 
as for the companion of the twain one be a girl seventeen or eighteen year of age the other a girl a couple of year old 
each have a bow and quiver as do -PRON- angel 
the old of these young lady have golden hair a shade light than the angel whilst the hair of the young be white as snow 
at first i think that -PRON- must be powder but this as not so 
and as i gaze with interest and wonder upon this lovely creature i think of christopher columbus and sir isaac at thirty -PRON- have hair like her 
that think however be a fleeting one 
this be no time forsooth to be think of old christopher and sir isaac 
strange more wonderful be this old world of -PRON- than even columbus or newton ever have dream -PRON- 
the age of -PRON- angel by the way i place at about twentyfive year 
and i wonder how -PRON- could possibly reckon time here in this underground world a world that could have neither month nor year 
the quartfct listen eageilv to the explanation give by -PRON- angel 
suddenly the leader address some question to persephone as rhode call -PRON- 
and then -PRON- hear -PRON- drome be -PRON- answer 
there -PRON- be distinct unmistakable that mysterious word which have give -PRON- so many strange and wild thought and vision 
yes there -PRON- be and -PRON- be an answer i think that by no mean put the man mind at ease 
drome drome at last 
but do -PRON- mean 
drome 
there -PRON- distinctly hear the angel pronounce the word again 
drome if -PRON- could only have understand the word be speak 
but there be no mistaking i think the manner of the angel 
-PRON- be early and yet strangely enough that sibylline quality about -PRON- be now more pronounced than ever 
but there be no mistake -PRON- manner -PRON- be endeavor to reassure -PRON- to allay -PRON- seem some strange uneasiness or fear 
i notice however with some vague sinister misgiving that in this -PRON- be by no mean as successful as -PRON- -PRON- desire 
why do -PRON- see in the eye of the leader and in those of the other so strange so mysterious a look whenever those eye be turn toward that spot where milton rhode and i stand 
however these gloomy thought be suddenly break but certainly not banish 
with an acquiescent reply at any rate so i think -PRON- to the angel the leader abruptly face -PRON- 
-PRON- place -PRON- bow and arrow upon the ground slip the quiver from -PRON- back draw -PRON- sword -PRON- be doubleblade 
i now note from -PRON- scabbard and deposit -PRON- too upon the ground 
-PRON- companion be follow suit the two girl who be now hold the light stand by motionless and silent 
the man advance a few pace 
each place -PRON- sword hand over -PRON- heart utter something in measured and sonorous tone and bow low to -PRON- a proceeding i note out of the corner of -PRON- eye that not a little pleased -PRON- angel remark milton rhode -PRON- expression one of the utmost gravity when in drome bill do as the droman do 
and -PRON- return the bow of the hypogean hereupon the man step back to -PRON- weapon which -PRON- at once resume and the young woman without move from the spot incline -PRON- head to -PRON- in a most stately fashion 
bow again from rhode and -PRON- 
this ceremony over i hope that -PRON- have do the thing handsomely the angel turn to -PRON- and tell -PRON- in pantomime of course that -PRON- avere now friend and that -PRON- heart be glad 
friend say i to -PRON- 
-PRON- be no gladder madam than i be but all the same i be go to be on -PRON- guard 
the girl mo ed to the angel and with touching tenderness examine -PRON- bleed avrist which the young at once proceed to bandage carefully 
-PRON- have make to bathe the wound but this the angel have not permit from avhieh -PRON- avas patent that there avould be no access to water for some time yet 
-PRON- amalthea and -PRON- companion now hold an earnest consultation 
again hear -PRON- pronounce that word drome 
and again -PRON- in the look and mien of the other doubt and uneasiness and something i think besides 
but this avas for a moment only 
either -PRON- acquiesce wholly in avhat the angel urge or -PRON- mash -PRON- feeling 
i wish that i know which -PRON- be 
and yet have i know i should have be none the wise forsooth unless i have be cognizant of what -PRON- be that the angel be urge so earnestly and with such confidence 
that -PRON- be something closely concern -PRON- be of course obvious 
that -PRON- or part of -PRON- be to the effect that -PRON- should be take to some place be i believe virtually certain 
not that this make matter a whit clear or in any measure allay -PRON- uneasiness 
for where be -PRON- to be take 
and to what to drome but what and where be this drome 
be drome a place be -PRON- a thing be -PRON- a human being or what be -PRON- 
such be some of the thought that come to -PRON- as i stand there 
but what good to wonder to question when there could be no answer forthcome 
sooner or later the answer would be our 
and in the meantime well more than sufficient unto the day be the mystery thereof 
and besides hadnot rhode and i come to find mystery 
assuredly 
and assuredly -PRON- be not likely that -PRON- would be disappoint 
this grave matter whatever -PRON- be decide the angel plunge into a detailed account of what have happen on the bridge 
-PRON- think that -PRON- follow -PRON- recital very closely so expressive be -PRON- gesture 
when -PRON- tell how -PRON- have save -PRON- from that frightful chasm -PRON- be interrupt by exclamation all eye be turn upon -PRON- and i feel certain in that moment that -PRON- be indeed friend 
still heaven only know what await -PRON- 
tt be well of course to be sanguine but that do not mean that -PRON- should blink fact however vague and mysterious those fact may be 
there be a momentary pause 
when -PRON- go on i see the angel low lip begin to tremble and tear come into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be describe the death of -PRON- demon -PRON- poor poor demon 
well as regard appearance i must own that i would greatly prefer that hideous apebat of her to many a bulldog that i have see 
the other too look distressed 
and indeed i have no doubt that -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- know all about demon would have be well at least troubled 
little do milton and i dream that the loss of that wing monster may entail upon -PRON- little band the most serious consequence 
so however -PRON- be as -PRON- be soon to learn 
when -PRON- have end -PRON- account the angel turn to -PRON- forthwith and go through an earnest and remarkable pantomime 
-PRON- and the other await -PRON- answer with the most intense interest 
but the only answer -PRON- could give -PRON- be that -PRON- do not understand 
that pantomime have be wholly unintelligible to milton rhode and -PRON- 
i say wholly unintelligible -PRON- could see however that -PRON- have something to do with -PRON- and something to do with something up above but everything else in -PRON- be an utter mystery 
the angel go through -PRON- again more slowly moie carefully and more fully this time 
but still -PRON- could not understand 
perhaps i suggest -PRON- could tell -PRON- with paper and pencil 
not a bad idea bill 
thereat rhode produce pencil and notebook 
these -PRON- give to the angel with a sign that -PRON- put -PRON- down in the book 
-PRON- regard the pencil curiously for some moment try -PRON- upon the paper and then with some difficulty and undoubtedly some pain what with -PRON- ed wrist -PRON- begin 
rhode move to -PRON- right side i to -PRON- left 
yes there could be no mistake that -PRON- have draw the tamahnowis rock 
then -PRON- draw a crevasse and two figure plainly 
rhode and -PRON- go down into -PRON- 
that be clear as the day 
then -PRON- put those figure that be rhode and i into the tunnel and presto with a wave of the hand -PRON- bring -PRON- down to that very spot where -PRON- be stand 
clear again lovely sibyl 
what next more figure and more and more and be -PRON- too come down the tunnel 
yes atlast -PRON- all be plain at last -PRON- wise numskull understand -PRON- 
be -PRON- alone rhode make -PRON- clear to -PRON- that -PRON- be 
but -PRON- do not stop there -PRON- proceed to make -PRON- clear to -PRON- that tee only know the secret 
-PRON- be some time in understanding this but when -PRON- do understand -PRON- what a look be that which pass across -PRON- lovely sibylline feature 
great heaven say i to -PRON- go and do -PRON- now 
the look be one of joy the look of a soul triumphant 
in a moment however -PRON- be go -PRON- feature be only lovely impassive 
but the thought and the feeling which that strange look of her have arouse be not go 
i feel a shudder pass to -PRON- heart 
of a truth this woman be dreadful 
i glance at rhode i think that even -PRON- look grave and troubled 
well so i think may hebe i say nothing however until the angel have rejoin -PRON- companion 
then there can be not the slight doubt that -PRON- look with great fear upon the coming of people from that world above a world as mysterious i suppose to -PRON- as this subterranean world of -PRON- be to -PRON- 
and now that -PRON- know that -PRON- have the great secret also when -PRON- have -PRON- and -PRON- well milton old tillicum think -PRON- will indeed be strange if either of -PRON- ever again cast a shadow in the sun 
-PRON- may be so bill -PRON- say soberly do pot think of that when i tell -PRON- 
still who know 
certainly not -PRON- be possible indeed probable -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- may do -PRON- -PRON- bill a harsh injustice sincerely hope so 
that grave look leave -PRON- face and -PRON- smile at -PRON- and besides billy -PRON- lad maybe -PRON- win t ever want to return to that world -PRON- have leave that world so full of ignorance and yet so full of knowledge and science too that world so cruel and yet sometimes so strangely kind that world so full of hate and mad passion and yet with ideal and aspiration so very noble and lofty 
yes who know bill 
-PRON- be possible that -PRON- may not want to return 
be -PRON- significant or be -PRON- puiely casual 
i could not decide 
but rhode gaze be now on the angel 
and whilst i stand ponder -PRON- turn and sign to -PRON- that -PRON- stand in readiness to proceed 
-PRON- raise a hand and point down the cavern in some subtle manner make -PRON- clear that -PRON- be point to something far very far away 
drome -PRON- say 
drome nodded milton rhode 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- 
ready bill 
ready i tell -PRON- 
and so -PRON- start 
next month chapter describe a veritable inferno as the droman and rhode and carter penetrate through weirdly flicker phosphorescent light into a region of strange and terrible monster which attack -PRON- 
frenchman and patriot more yankee than the nativeborn since -PRON- take out naturalization paper wear the british flag in -PRON- buttonhole on independence day 
a story hang upon this the story of a dead hero to whom the presence of paul become an outrage and abomination 
and -PRON- be brodsky who save paul from -PRON- postmortem vengeance 
the psychical investigation of dr ivan brodsky and the marvelous result which -PRON- have obtain in -PRON- warfare against the host of evil some of which i have previously recount have by this time make -PRON- know to a large circle of those to whom such thing as spiritual possession be fact rather than theory 
in hospital in prison wherever -PRON- find pain and sin congregated occult manifestation be a commonplace of this be the sixth of a series of story each complete in -PRON- deal with dr ivan brodsky the surgeon of soule existence though fear of ridicule debar the inmate from make any mention of -PRON- 
-PRON- be in such institution that reputation spread broadcast 
but there be prison for the dead as well as the living as i shall show 
neither brodsky nor i be greatly surprize when a visitor enter -PRON- study one evening and implore -PRON- aid in the unraveling of a mystery which have -PRON- be convince a supernatural explanation 
at least i canot help think so -PRON- sir say the man speak fluently but with a slight foreign accent 
although i be not a believer in such thing -PRON- 
brodsky s brow clouded that be the stock phrase that -PRON- detest 
if -PRON- do not believe in such thing how dare -PRON- make the suggestion that -PRON- exist -PRON- cry 
be honest with -PRON- and with -PRON- man or go elsewhere 
do -PRON- believe in -PRON- or do -PRON- not 
yes sir i do reply -PRON- visitor 
but when one make such an admission one be ridicule -PRON- s hard humph grunt the doctor 
go ahead with -PRON- story 
the visitor sit down and finger -PRON- hat nervously 
-PRON- be apparently a man of the laboring class to judge from -PRON- appearance yet -PRON- show sign of intelligence superior to that of most of -PRON- kind 
i could account for -PRON- mental disturbance only when -PRON- have finish -PRON- story a frenchman by birth sir -PRON- begin and be seven year in this country 
dupuy be -PRON- name a naturalized citizen and proud of -PRON- adopt country 
i learn -PRON- trade in paris -PRON- s a queer trade and there s not many throughout the whole world follow -PRON- so that -PRON- pay well especially as -PRON- require a certain amount of artistic ability though less than -PRON- would suppose 
i be a maker of wax figure for the waxwork theater on fifth street 
-PRON- may not know the place gentleman for people seem somehow to have lose interest in that form of entertain ment though -PRON- use to be the craz vear go by 
-PRON- task be to model lifesize wax figure of all people of ifrominence get the famous murderer of course and the president and the hero of the revolution and all the famous king and queen of england the great soldier and sailor wellington napoleon nelson fan gh say the doctor 
let the dead rest in -PRON- grave -PRON- know that every time -PRON- set up an image of the dead -PRON- form a focus in which all that remain of -PRON- personality on earth concentrate 
that commandment against make replica of life in stone which ould have include wax -PRON- friend have ax figure be know be the wise and most spiritual of all 
go well sir say -PRON- visitor as i tell -PRON- constantly at work fashion these figure for mr margotson the proprietor 
-PRON- didnot have any of naval officor up to a few eek ago but mr margotson be always look out for something new so -PRON- say to -PRON- dupuy let have a few statue of naval officer of historv 
do -PRON- remember any 
sure say villeneuve and st page and quit talk french say mr margotson 
what about john paul jone and nelson 
so i set to work and make replica of -PRON- 
the one of jone be fair but the nelson statue be firstrate i do -PRON- all from -PRON- portrait and there -PRON- stand in the gallery with one arm and one eye and everybody who come in recognize -PRON- at once 
and that bring -PRON- to the point 
ah -PRON- have have trouble with nelson cry brodsky 
mon dku say dupuy lapsing into -PRON- native tongue as -PRON- wipe -PRON- forehead try to murder -PRON- 
the man break off and eye -PRON- furtively 
i have long learn to keep guard over -PRON- face but incredulity be in -PRON- heart 
as for the doctor -PRON- say nothing and the man continue -PRON- must have be a eek ago that the first thing happen 
i be adjust the scabbard of -PRON- sword -PRON- use real sword in -PRON- scabbard and the point fly through and go right into -PRON- wrist just miss a large artery 
look -PRON- hold -PRON- hand up for -PRON- inspection 
there be a ragged cut half heal along the base of the hand 
and swear that the figure push the sword through the scabbard push -PRON- violently for -PRON- cut clear through the leather 
but i didn t catch on just then 
then four day afterward as i be pass -PRON- the thing fly from -PRON- pedestal and keel -PRON- over 
-PRON- head just miss the iron radiator by two inch 
and i tell -PRON- -PRON- didnot fall -PRON- fairly throw -PRON- at -PRON- 
what do mr margotson say to that ask brodsky 
-PRON- laugh at -PRON- 
i donot know what to do 
i ve half a mind to melt -PRON- and let margotson discharge -PRON- and yet i have -PRON- wife to think of and there s no demand for such man as -PRON- the business have fall off so 
and if i stay there one day the thing will kill -PRON- 
enough say brodsky go there at once 
can -PRON- get in have the key answer the frenchman put on -PRON- hat three leave the house together 
-PRON- catch a car on the main road which run past -PRON- one block away and half an hour later step out at the entrance to the waxwork theater which stand in what be now the heart of the business section of the city and be in consequence almost completely desert at this hour of the evening 
-PRON- companion pull out a key and open a side door 
-PRON- go up to a great hall round which be range statue of celebrity lifesize figure of strikingly human aspect 
and yet muse brodsky stop to regard a group of cleverly arrange hero of -PRON- civil war the man who erect these think -PRON- have nothing more than the external shell 
how ignorant -PRON- be of the psychic quality of -PRON- action indeed what da -PRON- dream of anything beyond the material 
yet this gallery be almost a breeding ground of soul 
who can measure what influence such being draw down to -PRON- 
well at least no evil spirit would be attract hither among these man who offer up -PRON- life for -PRON- country 
dupuy lead the way toward an end of the great hall 
here i see a group of figure attire in georgian dress evidently nelson would be find among these 
one of -PRON- however seem singularly incongruous and out of place 
-PRON- be a short thickset man in the costume of a mechanic of today 
-PRON- seem to move i start then i discover that -PRON- be a live man 
mr margotson cry dupuy in confusion 
but the proprietor seem still more confused than -PRON- assistant 
-PRON- come forward sheepishly and a mask seem to have descend upon -PRON- blank face and blot out some curious emotion which i have think that i read there 
mr margotson these be two gentleman who be interested in what i tell -PRON- about the statue dupuy stammer 
margotson s face grow black with rage 
newspaper writer eh -PRON- shout 
come to write up -PRON- museum i suppose 
i donot want -PRON- advertising i ve get all the customer i want and -PRON- canot do -PRON- no good 
damn -PRON- curiosity this fool be tell -PRON- some of -PRON- silly yarn about the nelson statue i suppose this rage appear so abnormal that -PRON- medical training induce -PRON- to examine margotson from the pathological standpoint 
but brodsky look into -PRON- face steadily and land -PRON- hand upon -PRON- shoulder 
margotson s anger seem suddenly to evaporate only interested in the statue turn into flesh and blood sir say the frenchman 
unluckily these word bring about a return of margotson s frenzy 
flesh and blood 
rubbish -PRON- shout 
arrant nonsense that s what -PRON- be talk dupuy the matter with the statue a very good statue one of the good -PRON- have make new wax green wax -PRON- call -PRON- in the trade and -PRON- ought to have have time to mature only the public be so craze over the naval officer that i didnot have time to let -PRON- lie why -PRON- hardening because of the fume from the leather factory across the street 
-PRON- drift in here something terrible all that s the matter with -PRON- 
look 
-PRON- switch on an electric light upon the wall behind -PRON- and for the first time i see clearly the face of the great english hero 
there be the irregular thin homely feature light by a flame of patriotic enthusiasm 
yet admirably as the artist have catch the inspiration of the painting from which -PRON- model -PRON- there seem something more some hardly define vein of cruelty of caprice that actually give the face the property of seem to reflect a certain change of emotion an instability of mind as though the thing possess some conscious life 
and the skin surely that be the skin of a man with the blood mantle in the flesh beneath 
dupuy start back with a wild cry at -PRON- 
look 
i swear i never put that smile upon -PRON- face -PRON- scream change change i tell -PRON- 
lord preserve -PRON- all get rid of -PRON- mr margotson 
if -PRON- hand -PRON- out any more of that nonsense fire -PRON- on the spot shout the enraged proprietor go daffy dupuy that s what s the matter with -PRON- always have that smile 
examine the wax gentleman -PRON- harden that s all 
with horror and repulsion i lay -PRON- finger on the smooth surface of the cheek 
so lifelike do -PRON- appear that i could have swear the blood fade out of the arteriole beneath the pressure blanch the surface of the skin 
and yet -PRON- be of wax 
-PRON- be not flesh and blood 
but flesh and blood differ less from -PRON- than -PRON- differ from the unreal and waxen figure around -PRON- 
-PRON- stoop half forward -PRON- seem instinct with slowly dawning vitality 
and surely -PRON- expression have change -PRON- have not smile thus with the cold malevolence of a conqueror when first i have see -PRON- 
then suddenly margotson seem transform 
as though -PRON- adapt -PRON- mood to suit -PRON- mind -PRON- burst into a wild peal of laughter 
good old nelson -PRON- shout and the sound echo from the roof and rang through the hall while for one dreadful moment i could have swear that an answer emotion flit across that waxen face 
good boy nelson 
a miracle of art dupuy 
i canot tear -PRON- away from watch -PRON- raise -PRON- salary 
-PRON- make -PRON- feel so good 
-PRON- want -PRON- to do something for -PRON- and find out what -PRON- be and do -PRON- give -PRON- a body and -PRON- s get -PRON- reason -PRON- friend say brodsky somewhat shake by this unexpected outburst 
come away come away gentleman cry the frenchman pull -PRON- by the arm mad god help -PRON- 
i should have tell -PRON- -PRON- would be act queer but last night when -PRON- laugh at -PRON- so much i think that -PRON- be only overwork 
-PRON- s as mad as a loon 
-PRON- do not need to be urge nor be there necessity of excuse 
margotson have already forget -PRON- and be stand before the statue alternately capering and grimace 
now give -PRON- -PRON- advice and shortly -PRON- can follow -PRON- or not at -PRON- peril say brodsky 
get -PRON- employer home in safety and then slip back and chop the thing to piece before a tragedy supervene 
no that s all get to say to -PRON- except just this give up -PRON- rade and learn something that wonot re -PRON- into conflict with all these vital force that hang round such dace 
and with these word -PRON- fairly turle -PRON- out of the place leave -PRON- to follow -PRON- as best i could think i mention once how sensitive the doctor always be to -PRON- morbid thing of life 
perhaps -PRON- be a certain sensibility to those invisible influence which accompany nood and invest those place where any violent emotion have be at play 
at any rate have see so nuch of the dark side of life brodky be strenuously insistent upon cleanliness and wholesomeness get to leave such tiling do and work in the sun -PRON- use say 
this be -PRON- work day when the night come at last may -PRON- good deed be -PRON- protective armor igainst all the host of devil on the night shore that -PRON- shall pass hrough 
-PRON- believe -PRON- have to pass hrough some place of purgation 
i ask have to clean up somehow in this life or the next -PRON- answer 
-PRON- canot get into heaven with dirty fingernail 
so on this occasion i forebore to question -PRON- when -PRON- get home 
brodsky go to a closet where -PRON- keep many relic of -PRON- early life md come out with a small union jack upon a molder staff 
the flag of the vessel that bear -PRON- from poland where the missarie be seek -PRON- life -PRON- aid sadly 
to what well use can -PRON- be put 
then -PRON- explain the mystery 
-PRON- be a fetish -PRON- say fill -PRON- tipe and puff at -PRON- slowly 
-PRON- be exactly similar in every particular to the idol of the west african or for that matter to any idol 
the savage make some dreadful idol to worship sacrifice to -PRON- until the thing become instinct with life and fill with all the passion of the worshiper then a devil have be call into existence whose evil influence be incalculable 
i tell -PRON- -PRON- be no mythical devil that the early christian missionary have to face nor those of today 
after death the pure spirit fly to -PRON- appoint rest place leave -PRON- two body molder behind -PRON- 
one be that earthly body that -PRON- all know the other be the soul body the body of desire a semiconscious force that survive for month or year accord to the condition of the dead being 
do not mistake -PRON- this be not nelson 
that great admiral be unconscious of this replica of -PRON- there in the waxwork theater 
-PRON- be a group of emotion such as possess nelson a man of strong feeling yet not necessarily -PRON- 
the warm enthusiasm of the crowd that have visit that place have focus these emotion much as the burn glass focus the ray of the sun 
remember as yet this creature be only half conscious 
-PRON- vaguely as in a dream feel this life within -PRON- -PRON- be rise toward a conscious existence 
and that fool margotson be the tool by which -PRON- mean to wreak -PRON- enmity upon dupuy 
but why do -PRON- hate the frenchman so much i ask 
do -PRON- not recollect motto the doctor ask hate a frenchman as -PRON- would the devil 
this elemental be that have attract these emotion that make up the great admiral soulbody have necessarily the identical feeling 
what do -PRON- know of the time that have elapse or the change of history be the frenchman and -PRON- will have -PRON- life by -PRON- if possible 
if -PRON- can not kill -PRON- as -PRON- try -PRON- will certainly do so th rough son 
well -PRON- none of ray business -PRON- add 
i ve warn dupuy 
and -PRON- go to bed while i forget to ask the purpose of the union jack which i see -PRON- stuff into -PRON- pocket 
but i know that brodsky could not dismiss -PRON- own responsibility so easily 
-PRON- do not undress for from -PRON- room which adjoin -PRON- own i hear -PRON- pace the floor with short quick footstep the great portion of the night 
i fall asleep at last and have hardly close -PRON- eye two minute as -PRON- seem before i hear the front doorbell jangled violently i start up in bed fill with horrible presentiment of evil and begin to dress -PRON- hurriedly 
a few moment later brodsky tap loudly upon -PRON- door 
dress -PRON- as quickly as -PRON- can -PRON- call work on foot for both of -PRON- before the morning 
as i hurry on -PRON- clothe i hear an agitated voice in the sitting room outside which i have little difficulty in recognize as that of the assistant at the waxwork theater 
-PRON- judgment be correct when i emerge i find -PRON- seat in a chair in a condition of collapse and brodsky stand over -PRON- hold a glass of some stimulant to -PRON- lip 
the doctor be fully dress even to -PRON- hat and from -PRON- pocketthere protrude a small corner of the british flag 
-PRON- go out together without any explanation 
luckily the car run at interval and -PRON- reach the corner of the main street 
-PRON- clamber in -PRON- be empty anddure the ride i learn in broken ejaculation from the man the cause of iiis visit 
-PRON- have halt irresolutely at the entrance to the waxwork theater after -PRON- leave -PRON- 
then -PRON- retracedhis step determine to carry out the doctor instruction as soon as -PRON- could get margotson away 
-PRON- see -PRON- employer stand before the statue regard -PRON- silently as though in a trance 
dupuy creep up to -PRON- pass the statue of necessity upon the opposite side 
and then -PRON- realize that margotson have draw the sword from the scabbard of the admiral and stand in such an attitude that dupuy could neither advance nor retreat 
at the same time -PRON- experience a return of that deathly faintness that have possess -PRON- on a previous occasion as -PRON- describe to -PRON- 
as in a trance -PRON- see margotson advance stealthily toward -PRON- while -PRON- remain incapable of resistance then -PRON- recover -PRON- sense and lean aside as margotson thrust 
run like the wind -PRON- gain the street outside and have presence of mind enough to lock the door behind -PRON- 
but i donot come in -PRON- insist as -PRON- gain the side door 
no sir see enough for tonight 
i donot go in 
-PRON- take all resolution to persuade dupuy to come 
without -PRON- presence the doctor say -PRON- would be powerless 
with -PRON- -PRON- may still break this spell and bring back margotson to sanity 
and at last very timidly dupuy creep in behind the doctor 
as brodsky unlock the door the key fall from -PRON- finger 
the key 
-PRON- must find -PRON- -PRON- cry to -PRON- 
under no circumstance may -PRON- follow -PRON- without -PRON- 
to do so may be fatal 
remember 
and before i have time to answer i see -PRON- spring lightly up the stairway drag the unwilling frenchman with -PRON- 
-PRON- immediate impulse be to dash after -PRON- then discipline come to -PRON- aid and i stoop for the key 
the night be dark and -PRON- be two minute before i find -PRON- 
then suddenly from within i hear wild shout and a stampede 
i spring up the stair and along the hall run with sob breath and clench fist till i gain the end where i see shadow hover 
frantically i switch on an electric light 
then i perceive margotson -PRON- face aflame like a madman thrust at brodsky with the admiral sword while the doctor parry -PRON- with admirable grace and ease 
dupuy come run up to -PRON- 
-PRON- rush at -PRON- -PRON- cry with -PRON- sword draw and dr brodsky snatch a sword from paul jone replica and meet -PRON- 
look 
the doctor win 
like every polish gentleman brodsky be an adept with the foil 
certainly a clumsy mechanic such as margotson could not have expect to overcome -PRON- 
yet as i watch the tense interchange of swordplay i be amazed at the skill show by margotson 
-PRON- seem as though the courage and prowess of the great admiral have descend upon -PRON- 
twice -PRON- lunge so fiercely that the point graze arm then with a sudden twist -PRON- send the weapon fly from the doctor hand and rush not at -PRON- but straight toward dupuy 
so swift be the impetus -PRON- be upon -PRON- before -PRON- could stir 
and then just as the blade seem about to pierce the heart something come fluttering downwaid over -PRON- head and the sword fall from margotson s hand and -PRON- stand still -PRON- eye fix upon vacancy -PRON- body immobile while dupuy release -PRON- from the fold of the union jack that brodsky have so admirably throw over -PRON- nd -PRON- think i can go back to -PRON- job ask dupuy the next morning 
by all mean answer the doctor 
margotson will remember nothing whatever of -PRON- insanity 
so -PRON- would better hurry up or -PRON- will want to know why -PRON- be late 
-PRON- need not fear the statue 
-PRON- ill have resume -PRON- natural aspect and in case any remnant of -PRON- power remain keep a small british flag in -PRON- buttonhole especially on holiday such as independence day 
yes that s -PRON- penalty dupuy patriot as -PRON- say -PRON- be the only alternative be the destruction of the statue which margotson wonot allow 
and when -PRON- can try to get another occupation 
-PRON- be a desperate chance confide brodsky to -PRON- afterward 
still one can deal with these elemental force much as the lunatic the mad impulse of national hatred be shatter instantly when -PRON- perceive the flag of -PRON- country 
when margotson wake up upon the floor of the gallery -PRON- will think that -PRON- get drunk tire night before 
but tell -PRON- i cry suddenly why do -PRON- make -PRON- wait till i find the key 
then the solution come to -PRON- 
-PRON- know -PRON- life be in danger and wish to save -PRON- from the possibility of injury i cry 
pshaw mutter the doctor 
just accept fact and donot put sentimental interpretation upon -PRON- 
the seventh symphony the next story in this series will be publish in weird tale next month 
ke 4r -PRON- press sturl against the pipe and bind -PRON- tightly to -PRON- 
nl 
i a piece of string into the grate where presently -PRON- begin to smolder 
kobyssu stop talk and sniff 
although in appearance -PRON- be ferocious with -PRON- little simian forehead -PRON- black bush of eyebrow and -PRON- big bristling mustache -PRON- be in reality a fellow of most pleasant even temperament 
but -PRON- be plain that the string have disturb -PRON- greatly 
-PRON- cheek have pale and i get a glimpse of -PRON- eye as -PRON- bend forward swiftly in -PRON- chair and level -PRON- at the hearth 
the expression in -PRON- be twofold 
there be deep anger there be equally deep horror 
-PRON- see the string snatch at -PRON- and cast -PRON- into the heart of the fire so that -PRON- flame instantly 
pouf -PRON- say wave -PRON- hand in front of -PRON- nose and now exceedingly white 
i be amazed but all i say be sorry i didnot think the smell would worry -PRON- 
kobyssu look round -PRON- cafe desert at this hour of the afternoon 
-PRON- look at the neat table at the wall at -PRON- desk rather with the air of a man who wish to assure -PRON- that -PRON- be indeed in wardour street london and nowhere else 
then -PRON- face the fire again -PRON- eye more normal but very somber 
that smell of slowburne hemp -PRON- remind -PRON- of something in czergona 
but say -PRON- often tell -PRON- that every memory of -PRON- native country be dear to -PRON- 
only yesterday -PRON- quote some absurd proverb to a czerg the howl of a wolf in -PRON- homeland be more comforting than the lowing of -PRON- cattle in a foreign land 
-PRON- be a true proverb 
-PRON- country may be merely what -PRON- newspaper say a barren mountain range in but i love every memory of -PRON- except one 
that be a memory of dreadful thing 
there be a table with coffee between -PRON- chair 
-PRON- fill -PRON- cup 
from any country however great and refined one may get a memory of dreadful thing -PRON- say defend czergona 
i nod 
yet these be strangely dreadful -PRON- draw in -PRON- breath with a long hiss stare broodingly at the sugarbowl 
the odor of that string recall to -PRON- the church stove at raebrudafisk so suddenly so without warn that i believe i be back in the past and i feel the feeling of twelve year ago i have a shock 
what about this stove 
but pardon kobyssu perhaps -PRON- would pain -PRON- to tell -PRON- 
perhaps the matter be personal 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head be not directly concerned i be thankful to say 
but the story be too fearful a thing to relate idly over coffee 
and -PRON- would be sorry if i put -PRON- in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- would strive to forget -PRON- and never forget -PRON- no no i do not want to tell -PRON- 
but -PRON- curiosity have rise high 
i urge kobyssu and -PRON- yield 
i be punish 
i wish i have not hear a word of the tale of the church stove at raebrudafisk which kobyssu narrate in the fluent english that -PRON- have acquire so praiseworthily during recent year aebrudafisk -PRON- say be the village i be bear in 
-PRON- be on a hillside in a fir wood 
the church which be of stone be a quarter of a mile from -PRON- up the hill 
when as a little boy i be take to church by -PRON- parent the stove use to interest -PRON- very much 
-PRON- be not far from where -PRON- sit near the north wall 
-PRON- be an upright iron cylinder about three foot high and two foot in diameter have a flat top with a flap at the edge of this which open so that coal and wood could be pour in 
a stout pipe go from the stove right up to the roof and through -PRON- 
in summer of course the stove be not light 
in winter -PRON- be attend to by old uflio vaang 
-PRON- would start the fire some two hour before the morning service and why the stove interest -PRON- be this by the time i enter the church the flat top would be a glow red with dazzlingspark appear suddenly on -PRON- when speck of stuff fall there from the ceiling and the pipe would be red halfw ay to the roof brilliant red at the base duller the high -PRON- look yet hot -PRON- can imagine be extremely fond of that stove especially at evening service when snow and darkness and wolf be outside the church 
i yearn to spend the night by -PRON- and think pastor and people would be much more sensible to do so instead of fare down the hill all in a bunch for fear of the wolf 
and i be a young rascal 
i get into the habit of flick bit of stre on to the stove to see -PRON- smoke and burst into flame 
but a thrashing from -PRON- father and another from the pastor cure -PRON- of that 
there be a good draft to that stove -PRON- have some bar low down in front 
and old uflio though everybody warn -PRON- not to drench the fuel with oil before light -PRON- 
stove and pipe be red long before church time 
kobyssu drink some coffee and make a considerable pause 
i know -PRON- be hope that some customer would arrive and give -PRON- a pretext for break off altogether 
none come however so -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder and proceed 
old uflio vaang be wonderful 
-PRON- be completely blind 
-PRON- have be blind since early manhood 
with no difficulty -PRON- would find -PRON- own way to the church place -PRON- hand on anything -PRON- require and set the stove go 
dangerous work for a blind man -PRON- will think eh 
yet -PRON- be know to be so careful that despite the matter of oil people do not fear an accident 
uflio s perception be uncanny 
i have notice the stove fail a trifle toward the end of morning service the top go from yellowscarlet to crimson and uflio sense the change have rise from -PRON- chair and tiptoe down the church and pick up a small tong and open the flap grip -PRON- at the first attempt and lump by lump not to make a loud noise -PRON- have drop coal into the redhot thing run no more peril of burn -PRON- than would a man with two healthy eye 
well twelve year ago when i be a swineherd of twenty and have not commence to think of london or even of warsaw old uflio be still tend the stove 
naturally i have lose -PRON- boyish interest in -PRON- 
i never suppose that i should be interested in -PRON- again 
kobyssu pause once more 
when -PRON- resume such a note of sadness be in -PRON- voice that i experience a chill a dread and the first of -PRON- regret at have importune -PRON- for the story 
i have not reckon on a tragedy to a young girl which i perceive loom 
uflio vaang have a daughter say -PRON- djira 
-PRON- be sixteen pretty brightnatured oh delightful 
-PRON- be the old man only child and ashis wife be dead all in the world -PRON- have to care for 
i be not in love with djira 
i be think of a girl in the next village 
but the other young man of raebrudafisk be in love with -PRON- as unhappily be a man not young 
that be oik sturl whose age be forty and who be often in prison for stealing or violence 
-PRON- be a sullen blackguard ordinarily when enrage -PRON- be the vile of brute 
of course -PRON- chance to win djira the sweet fresh bud be hopeless 
but i suppose -PRON- do not believe this until -PRON- waylay -PRON- one afternoon far from -PRON- village 
then -PRON- must have convince -PRON- 
would -PRON- have not poor child poor little innocent 
the truth infuriate -PRON- 
-PRON- cut -PRON- throat there and then 
kobyssu 
-PRON- do there and then say kobyssu the deep anger in -PRON- eye again and -PRON- tooth glint under -PRON- mustache 
-PRON- clench -PRON- fist and shake -PRON- at the floor 
-PRON- do -PRON- repeat and -PRON- do more 
that the scent of much blood may bring the wolf who would hide -PRON- crime -PRON- stab -PRON- hack -PRON- little pure body ahh 
kobyssu blow out -PRON- breath and drum -PRON- finger agitatedly on -PRON- knee 
so this be what the stove that djira s father tend remind kobyssu of 
as -PRON- be fact not fiction i do not want to hear anything further 
and yet i feel i must know what happen to the villain sturl 
i say so and add in dismay kobyssu -PRON- donot have capital punishment in czergona do -PRON- 
no -PRON- answer with a peculiar inflection of -PRON- voice 
the wolf do not get djira -PRON- go on 
-PRON- young man of raebrudafisk reach -PRON- first 
for a boy see what sturl do and run to tell -PRON- 
-PRON- run for -PRON- life since sturl have catch sight of -PRON- and be chase -PRON- 
sturl could not overtake -PRON- and turn in another direction when -PRON- perceive the lad would gain the village 
yes -PRON- go to djira and then -PRON- and the man of the whole countryside seek sturl 
many among -PRON- vow to slay -PRON- when -PRON- come upon -PRON- but the pastor and schoolmaster wiec who be the magistrate of the district sternly forbid this 
for over two week in wild weather of sleet and bitter wind -PRON- hunt vainly scour wood climb to the niche in the mountaintop and even search -PRON- coal mine to which -PRON- think the pierce cold may have drive sturl 
-PRON- wonder how -PRON- obtain food and at every step -PRON- take amid the tree or up the rock -PRON- expect to discover -PRON- dead from exposure 
-PRON- can conceive and pity uflio this while 
i consider that -PRON- lot be bad than -PRON- the one earthly gladness of -PRON- blind life -PRON- the bright the gentle whose lip and hand caress -PRON- so lovingly whose greeting wake -PRON- in the morning whose voice tell -PRON- the hue of the sky and the promise of the garden -PRON- hold by a foul hand and slaughter that be what -PRON- have to think of 
small wonder that for day the torment make -PRON- almost insane and that -PRON- womenfolk could give -PRON- no consolation 
the sunday after the murder -PRON- do not go to the church be too ill and weak 
on the follow thursday however when there be an evening service -PRON- take up -PRON- routine and the stove be glow when -PRON- enter the church 
-PRON- be sad indeed to look at uflio in -PRON- usual seat but bent and tremulous with -PRON- cheek so sunken and ghastly that -PRON- be scarcely to be recognize 
perhaps -PRON- be saddest to notice the coal smear and a tiny gleam of oil on -PRON- hand when -PRON- raise -PRON- 
little djira have always be most careful to wipe -PRON- for -PRON- ere service begin 
as i say for over two week -PRON- search for sturl and -PRON- find not a trace of -PRON- 
then at dawn one morning -PRON- village be rouse by a new alarm 
the village of phvamu four mile away where -PRON- find and store oil be on fire 
schoolmaster wioe want every man of -PRON- to hurry across and aid the phvamu people 
i have break -PRON- arm two day previously seek sturl 
to witness the blaze however i set out with the rest 
-PRON- chirm vavik rista and a dozen other take a path which go by the church 
although -PRON- rise steeply -PRON- begin to cover -PRON- at a trot 
-PRON- have go a hundred yard past the church when a man -PRON- clothe flutter in rag spring out into the way in front of -PRON- spring as if from -PRON- sleep and try to run before either of -PRON- foot be well back on the ground -PRON- seem to wrench one and fall 
-PRON- be sturl 
vavik and seveial more dart forward instantly reach -PRON- as -PRON- come to -PRON- knee and hold -PRON- 
lend -PRON- a knife say vavik whom djira have show many indication of love 
but two or three cry no no what will the pastor and schoolmaster wiee say 
yet there be other who agree with vavik and -PRON- be a long time before -PRON- could quiet -PRON- 
and all this while phyamu be burn and -PRON- be need cry someone 
-PRON- point to the thin strong rope many be carry to the scene of the fire 
tie the beast to a tree until -PRON- come back 
wolf object someone else 
so much the well shouted vavik 
but a voice suggest leave sturl in the church and thither -PRON- drag -PRON- 
-PRON- bind -PRON- meaning to let -PRON- lie on the floor 
see -PRON- gnash with -PRON- tooth at the rope about -PRON- and know -PRON- to be so supple that -PRON- may stretch to and gnaw through some -PRON- gag -PRON- very firmly so that though -PRON- be rage at -PRON- the sound -PRON- make be but as the hiss of the wind about the church 
then -PRON- begin to roll and to knock -PRON- head against the floor 
-PRON- must make -PRON- fast to something say one of -PRON- 
-PRON- stare around the church 
there be no pillar there seem nothing to lash sturl to 
and then hrok nalti the chairmaker point to the stove 
stand -PRON- on that 
tie -PRON- to the pipe 
-PRON- do so fetch a ladder and a high bench from the vestry 
-PRON- press sturl against the pipe and bind -PRON- tightly to -PRON- and in a hard spirit for which -PRON- may be forgive -PRON- bind -PRON- more than be necessary 
-PRON- swathe and swathe -PRON- with rope until nearly all be use 
with the last length since -PRON- make an attempt to beat -PRON- head against the pipe -PRON- bind that also pass the rope thrice across -PRON- brow and round the pipe thus force the back of -PRON- skull immovably against the iron 
then -PRON- hasten to phyamu 
-PRON- will have observe that i have say -PRON- in all this 
-PRON- be right that i should as i be of the party 
but the work as not the sort for a man with a fractured arm so that throughout i be an onlooker 
justifiably or not i find relief in the knowledge of this 
-PRON- hasten i say to phyamu 
keep together for no particular reason except that -PRON- arrive together late and tell none that -PRON- have capture sturl because -PRON- be jeer at for -PRON- tardiness -PRON- start to roll cask of oil into safety 
i help wdth one hand and time be pass when suddenly hrok straighten -PRON- back and fling out -PRON- arm stiffly utter a queer gurgle groan 
-PRON- be sunday morning -PRON- say 
-PRON- take -PRON- not a second to realize -PRON- meaning 
-PRON- see sturl a figure of rope stiff and upright like some strange soldier on the stove in the church at raebrudafisk sturl incapable of movement incapable of sound save such as the wdnd be make 
-PRON- see the church door slowdy open and uflio stoneblind uflio appear 
-PRON- see -PRON- go to the vestry and emerge wdth fagot paper and coal 
-PRON- see -PRON- arrange the fuel in the stove utterly unconscious of sturl although -PRON- finger would approach to within a few inch of the wretch foot whenever -PRON- manipulate the flap at the top 
-PRON- see -PRON- bring a bottle of oil from -PRON- pocket soak the fuel and light -PRON-

the black who fear the magic trick of phillip more than the sorcery of -PRON- own magician have none of that respect for daken 
in -PRON- heart -PRON- know that -PRON- would in all probability be take and torture 
phillip little brown wife have warn -PRON- have even offer to guide -PRON- through the tortuous lane of jungle tree bed in black water rank with the smell of walkabout ground of crocodile yet in -PRON- eye limpid and dark as dew in the heart of a black orchid -PRON- have read hate and a desire for vengeance toward gwanoo the chieftain whom phillip have outwit of a bride when -PRON- take the girl to -PRON- own hut 
a week before phillip have go with gwanoo on a pigsticke expedition 
three day or rather night later daken have be waken by the brown girl song of mourning nor could -PRON- laugh aside -PRON- fear 
on the following morning gwanoo return seat -PRON- on the edge of this lagoon and behead phillip body prepare the head as a decora234 tive addition to -PRON- already fine collection 
powerless to prevent daken have be ill over -PRON- endure three day of rack fear while the brown woman keep guard and -PRON- sleep to dream of the head of -PRON- friend the red hair and bushy red beard

drink have the effect on daken of leave -PRON- body and flesh cold -PRON- brain alert and afire and the skill of the surgeon -PRON- have once be always turn -PRON- to -PRON- case of knife 
behind -PRON- eyelid for three day and night the head of phillip seem urge -PRON- to vengeance not to glut cruelty phillip be too fine a man for that but that the fear of the white man may once more make -PRON- safe for daken to stay on the lagoon and finish the note for which both man have already sacrifice year 
palm wine ferment daily have not quiet -PRON- fear but -PRON- dull -PRON- power to fight that mad dream of cure the head of gwanoo as -PRON- have mummie the head of phillip 
the brown woman little dream the peril -PRON- loose waken and carry the jar of wine to daken 
-PRON- tilt back -PRON- head and drink thirstily 
the monkey swing across the hut and crouch at -PRON- knee one small black paw on -PRON- wrist 
daken pat -PRON- head then pour wine in -PRON- palm -PRON- let -PRON- drink 
-PRON- hear the soft cry of protest from the woman and in sheer perversity give the little beast a second drink of wine

if i have -PRON- agility say da ken whimsically get -PRON- 
the brown woman call the monkey in vain and -PRON- scold daken in quick angry native word 
-PRON- have forget that -PRON- be jealous of the friendship between -PRON- and phillip forget that -PRON- be a comely little primitive whose lovely brown body shape to foot with great prehensile toe not unlike those of the monkey 
-PRON- be griefstricken as only a primitive can be and -PRON- realize a moment later that in -PRON- resentment at -PRON- give wine to the beast -PRON- have suddenly cast off any feeling of allegiance for -PRON- 
a moment later -PRON- snatch the monkey and plunge into the lagoon and be swim through the clear water toward shore 
daken smile 
watch -PRON- brown body sleek and smooth as satin in the sungreen water -PRON- be conscious only of -PRON- symmetry the pleasing unity of muscular strength and the fact that -PRON- be run true to type a daughter of the jungle go back 
-PRON- would -PRON- suppose return to gwanoo but -PRON- think -PRON- own chance of escape vrere well than -PRON- chance for life if the sorcerer take -PRON- 
for -PRON- own sake daken wish -PRON- have not go but the palm wine have cure -PRON- of the clutch and bite and twist of fear 
-PRON- feel aloof prime for contemplative interest in forthcoming event know that if the black man storm the hut -PRON- have -PRON- own gun and nee not endure torture 
the girl have reach shore 
there -PRON- stand on a strip of dazzle white coral beach shine in brown loveliness against a mass of creamy hibiscus the heartsearche perfume of which come to -PRON- nostril with the seatang 
the monkey be in -PRON- arm and -PRON- whisper with red lip against -PRON- cheek caress -PRON- with brown hand 
and at that moment the jungle drum pulse a quick staccato probe -PRON- brain with hot finger of sound -PRON- heat and wine have make daken drowsy and again -PRON- wish the girl have not go 
-PRON- dare not sleep without -PRON- keep guard 
-PRON- be afraid of this somnolence caress -PRON- flesh stroke with languorous touch the strength from -PRON- body 
the repeat draft be hit violently and presently ho rise find -PRON- case of surgical knife and begin polish -PRON- force -PRON- mind to memory of operation -PRON- have accomplish in day go by 
tli on as -PRON- turn -PRON- gaze toward the shore whence come the palpitant drum quivering louder and faster as the funeral orgy get under way -PRON- see a patch of sunlight piercing tree branch and fall in a circle of gold on the lagoon 
in -PRON- little fish swarm to snap at insect and daken seem to see again the head of phillip only now the eye be open implore urge -PRON- to action 
-PRON- try to fathom the meaning conscious that -PRON- be madness a spot of sunlit water alive with gaudy fish but the fantasy persist 
-PRON- go to the door still stare brush -PRON- hand across -PRON- eye and as wind stir the palm the spot of light shift toward shore and follow -PRON- -PRON- see a shine topaz gleam in the jungle the fire where hate and superstition dance in black ghoul shape about the bier of the dead white man 
-PRON- hear the song a savage sound of broken irritate rhythm a song so old that not even the singer understand -PRON- full significance a song that go with shoreless river and jungle tree root in black water stir by scale horror with gape jaw 
the brown girl be go 
daken shudder to think what may be happen unless -PRON- comeliness earn a merciful death 
-PRON- turn again to the spot on the lagoon but the sun have move and the water be in shadow the little fish flutter like scatter star in a cool green sky 
then the drumbeating be abruptly break and a wild outcry end the song 
two paradise bird dance in the top of tall tree fly away from some disturbance 
daken forget -PRON- fear 
-PRON- be stare at the head of phillip hang from a small black paw in a clump of dark foliage -PRON- luxurious beard stir by the wind -PRON- lip tightsewn but seemingly pucker in a grim smile as if -PRON- owner enjoy the joke -PRON- have find beyond the shore of life 
daken want to laugh with the head 
the monkey which have love phillip have steal -PRON- head from the funeral wreath of the village and swing through the tree 
-PRON- leap down from the branch and the brown girl spring up from -PRON- hiding place to catch -PRON- in -PRON- arm 
there be the sharp of an arrow and a cluster of fall flower 
the girl sway a moment then catch the monkey and race to the lagoon and be swim 
-PRON- as almost to the hut when the jungle belch black man 
daken snatch -PRON- gun and fire 
a savage whirl and fall -PRON- lip at the lagoon ripple 
the girl be swim under water a brown undulating power which daken long to watch and dare not 
a second and third shot crack and the black man halt reluctant to change so soon -PRON- feast of flesh to an outflow of soul 
the brown girl reach the hut and swarm wdth incredible swiftness to -PRON- door while the black chatter in consultation on shore 
daken feel a wild elation at the crisis hurl upon -PRON- 
this be well than brood in the hut wait for death 
the girl be croon over the monkey which whine in a small squeaky voice and caress the head of phillip but daken see blood on -PRON- lip and know -PRON- be wound and presently the head oil from -PRON- grasp to the mat and lie grinning at daken through tightsewn lip as if -PRON- assure -PRON- that -PRON- be do well 
-PRON- would have give a year of life if -PRON- have the hope of so much to fathom the smile of those dead lip and guess what -PRON- would have advise 
-PRON- be conscious of urge phillip to tell -PRON- what to do 
-PRON- could not withstand a siege of the hut 
sooner or later -PRON- would rash -PRON- and -PRON- need time and bullet for the woman and -PRON- 
a grim respect for -PRON- courage thrill -PRON- a part of -PRON- elation over the stand -PRON- make 
-PRON- deserve a heroic end a shot that would send -PRON- soul to seek phillip who be wait 
daken feel the presence of -PRON- friend 
the head be no longer horrid -PRON- be as if phillip have come back 
then on shore the mass of black paite and gwanoo stand on the coral a magnificent black giant strong white tooth flash -PRON- headdress surmount with swaying plume of paradise scarlet flower encircle -PRON- oiled body 
and gwanoo boom -PRON- parley 
-PRON- demand the head if that be return -PRON- would take -PRON- man away to the feast

daken lick -PRON- dry lip 
-PRON- mind call demand of phillip how -PRON- should act if -PRON- must send on -PRON- girl phillip have love and follow -PRON- and leave the note garner at such a cost to molder in the hut -PRON- job phillip -PRON- hear -PRON- whisper -PRON- would trust gwanoo and -PRON- kill -PRON- 
-PRON- trust -PRON- and i donot know what to do phillip -PRON- be scarcely conscious that -PRON- speak until the brown girl creep to -PRON- foot and murmur kill gwanoo marster kill gwanoo as -PRON- kill -PRON- white man 
-PRON- have seize -PRON- gun and there be a sharp volley of shot a dozen leap black man and three inert body across the twist splendor that have be gwanoo then the other flee 
daken turn and seize the gourd and throw back -PRON- head empty the wine in great gasping gurgle down -PRON- own throat 
-PRON- need -PRON- 
the respite would be brief 
under cover of darkness -PRON- would return 
but the moment the black man wear in the jungle the girl be in the lagoon 
daken see -PRON- swimming back slowly weight by the body of the sorcerer which -PRON- haul up the step and drag in the door then -PRON- touch daken arm and point 
gwanoo still live 
in the girl eye be a gleam of triumph 
hate gwanoo as -PRON- do for the murder of -PRON- white man -PRON- show the lust and greed of the primitive -PRON- be at this chance of inflict on an enemy the torture -PRON- have see -PRON- visit on other 
daken see -PRON- daxt to the case of knife and seize the large sit on the floor and whet -PRON- blade on the sole of -PRON- foot then lean toward the inert gwanoo -PRON- lift the knife 
daken leap and catch hei wrist 
-PRON- be like a tiger in -PRON- grasp and only that -PRON- have be hurt -PRON- could not have keep -PRON- from murder 
-PRON- twist with uixbelievable strength and in the end turn -PRON- ferocity on -PRON- 
-PRON- never know how -PRON- happen but as -PRON- writhe and bit at -PRON- with -PRON- tooth there come a cry and -PRON- go limp the knifeblade thrust deep in -PRON- abdomen 
-PRON- scream change to a moan of agony 
blood spurt oxi -PRON- hand and -PRON- stagger with -PRON- to the heaped mat where the little monkey huddle nurse the head of phillip rom that moment daken lose track of event 
the wine the strain of the last three day and night the frenzied elation of killing and the sight of the lifeblood of the brown girl spill on the couch combine to wrest reason from -PRON- throne 
-PRON- go temporarily mad with a cool deadly insanity that turn from the stunned gwanoo to the die woman 
between -PRON- lie -PRON- case of knife 
a little beyond be other precious thing among -PRON- the highly prize jar of ether and chloroform 
-PRON- work with mad frenzy and dextrous surety of skill 
the monkey flee to the farth comer of the hut and hide 
the whimpering of the little beast be the only audible sound through the afternoon 
then the fume of palm wine leave -PRON- and tho ether clear in the wind that come at sunset and daken see and realize the work of -PRON- hand and -PRON- want to imitate the monkey crouch in utter darkness and hide 
yet with night would come the horde of death from the jungle and have endure so much -PRON- want to make a last stand sell as dearly as -PRON- could the life of the man now rouse from the mist of drink that have turn -PRON- madman 
why -PRON- do not then turn the gun on gwanoo -PRON- never know 
-PRON- may have be that the monkey creep presently from the shadow and come close to gwanoo s body reach a small black paw to touch the face of the black sorcerer 
the little brown girl be dead -PRON- body wrap in the mat but the stalwart gwanoo show sign of life 
one black hand with -PRON- heavy wristlet be lift to the bandage about the brow 
hear a moan the monkey creep close and the fumbling hand find and fondle the little beast which snuggle in the curve of gwanoo s arm 
daken sit at the door of the hut more alert than at any time since phillip death and -PRON- try to remember what -PRON- have do 
the action of the monkey puzzle -PRON- 
-PRON- have be fond of the brown girl and phillip never very friendly with daken yet -PRON- clung to the body of the savage sorcerer 
daken marvel at -PRON- wonder why -PRON- have extract the bullet from gwanoo s brain 
-PRON- lie on the table beside a welter of something that -PRON- would not look at now that -PRON- be sober 
for -PRON- have be very drunk 
-PRON- hand -PRON- body and brain have be control by the demon which drink rouse a demon this time that be that redhaire redbearded head on the mat 
daken reach out and take -PRON- on -PRON- knee 
what be -PRON- that -PRON- make -PRON- do phillip -PRON- demand of -PRON- 
why do -PRON- return from that bourne -PRON- have reach and take the girl with -PRON- -PRON- realize that -PRON- talk like a maniac but -PRON- could not stop 
be -PRON- for love of -PRON- the faithful little brown beauty or jealousy of -PRON- 
-PRON- need not have fear that a white girl in a white man land wait for -PRON- and now i canot go back 
-PRON- voice break canot go back with bloodguilty hand 
phillip i didnot deserve this treachery 
i come with -PRON- stay with -PRON- 
if only -PRON- have not go hunt with gwanoo -PRON- would have come out of this and gain honor 
-PRON- have accomplish much -PRON- have sacrifice these year and -PRON- own honorable career to catalogue these devil and now -PRON- have spoil the chance of ever give the result of that research to the world as i say -PRON- would do when -PRON- take the girl first 
the sun drop behind the dark line of palm cast shadow over the lagoon 
the thunderous sunset of papua seem to growl about -PRON- soft pantherhide of forest 
in the jungle the drum be beat up the tempo of that old song and daken be sweep on that rhythm to an interlude in which the year of -PRON- life in the jungle unfold before -PRON- eye and stand out from those het steam month be the affection of phillip for the brown girl 
-PRON- see -PRON- now as the one fatal mistake which would eventually destroy all -PRON- have do 
phillip have be mad about -PRON- 
die -PRON- would not rest until -PRON- be wing -PRON- way to -PRON- side 
daken come to believe -PRON- in that hour 
the will of the dead man have take a tortuous way to manifest -PRON- power but -PRON- be tangible audible as real to daken as the breath on -PRON- lip 
reason have no power to refute the thing 
-PRON- no longer fight the thought 
-PRON- whole body -PRON- mentality feel the will of phillip urge -PRON- to some task yet unfinished 
then as if answer the question twist mind the voice of gwanoo murmured water marster water 
daken leap to -PRON- foot 
this be no booming sound from the great throat of the sorcerer but a woman murmur the crooning word of the brown girl 
-PRON- reach for the gourd of boil and cool water and hold -PRON- to the thick lip 
the eye beneath the head bandage open and -PRON- seem to daken -PRON- have the same soft sheen as the girl eye the look of dew in the heart of a black orchid 
take -PRON- -PRON- people -PRON- jungle -PRON- murmur again and again 
daken shake -PRON- brush -PRON- hand over -PRON- face pinch the flesh of -PRON- arm 
stumble from the restless movement of the revive gwanoo -PRON- foot touch the head of phillip and snatch -PRON- up -PRON- would have place -PRON- on the table but the hand of gwanoo reach and draw -PRON- beside -PRON- 
the monkey rouse and catch -PRON- claws in the red beard daken throw up a hand to -PRON- lip to throttle the scream in -PRON- throat 
the shadow deepen 
the black papuan hill smoke against the furious crimson and amber of the sky 
in another few minute the light would die and night descend night and the batwinge fear that have hold -PRON- prisoner for day a bad fear than before because the hut hold unbelievable horror the body of the brown girl in the mat and the great gwanoo now revive rapidly call incessantly for water hug the monkey and the head to -PRON- breast 
that voice have power to bring daken with the gourd and the last of -PRON- precious brandy mix with water 
-PRON- be as if -PRON- feed magic to one of those flower which hindoo fakir raise from a seed to bud and bloom in the space of a few minute 
-PRON- be like gwanoo s own magic that pluck an orchid from the air and have -PRON- turn to a snake 
the sorcerer grow strong beyond belief 
with stare eye daken see -PRON- lean on one arm then sit upright still caress the monkey and the head and the affection of the little animal be the most curious thing of all 
daken feel as if -PRON- be catch in a nightmare 
then -PRON- be aware of the acceleration of the jungle song and drum 
-PRON- be come through the jungle come through the night come to the lagoon and -PRON- come for -PRON- 
-PRON- scalp prickle 
-PRON- stand at the hut doorwav dread the darkness that hold gwanoo and the head clutch mentally at the luminence of starlight on the lagoon water 
-PRON- see the black emerge thick shadow in the gloom see torch bloom and fire flash on knife and wreath of white hibiscus splotch by scarlet flower that look like dry blood 
the torch flare show -PRON- betelstaine tooth the bracelet of bone and metal the quiver headplume 
-PRON- be of no use to shoot at that mass better to reserve -PRON- bullet and strength for -PRON- rush 
-PRON- keep -PRON- revolver so that -PRON- may thrust -PRON- at any moment in -PRON- mouth and fire 
too late -PRON- wish -PRON- have dicker with gwanoo to have the note that -PRON- and phillip have make send out to a port 
now -PRON- would be as much waste as -PRON- life 
the savage be in the lagoon water 
on shore -PRON- have heap -PRON- torch and the blaze light the clear depth where little fish flash in scale gold 
daken turn to the darkness of the hut and lift the revolver 
-PRON- touch -PRON- chin and creep toward -PRON- lip -PRON- scream startle the swimmer 
from behind -PRON- the great arm of gwanoo catch and pinion -PRON- wrist to -PRON- side 
-PRON- see the torch flare from shore shine on the black face under the startling white gauze bandage see the soft dark eye shine hear the voice gentle as that of a woman not kill marster live an go out 
frantic frenzied daken twist in that grasp 
then the hut be fill with savage and the voice of gwanoo booming with -PRON- old strength command -PRON- warrior 
daken be hold in the grip of savage while gwanoo lean heavily on the shoulder of two black man look down at an uncovered dead girl on the mat 
daken see 
-PRON- heart pound in -PRON- throat as -PRON- appraise the work of -PRON- hand the neat surgery the delicate line of stitch under -PRON- hair 
what what in heaven name have -PRON- do that day far far away memory throb tap rustle a sheaf of picture experiment at college transplant the brain of one dog to the head of another -PRON- have skill at that -PRON- eye turn to the table where gwanoo be lift and drop -PRON- surgical instrument into the black case close -PRON- and gesture to one of -PRON- man to carry -PRON- 
something else lie there 
daken see with a surgeon interest paramount the brain of gwanoo 
-PRON- know at least -PRON- feel the knowledge of what -PRON- have do for -PRON- mind be drag over a trail without -PRON- own volition 
-PRON- be scarcely aware that -PRON- swing -PRON- to -PRON- shoulder and swam with -PRON- through the lagoon 
-PRON- see on shore the giant gwanoo still lean on the shoulder of -PRON- man but with the head of phillip clutch in one arm and the monkey perch on a shoulder beside the bandaged head of the sorcerer 
then for daken the light go out waken in a hut 
dawn pour -PRON- soft light through the doorway 
a soft murmur of woman s voice drone through -PRON- dream 
the jungle song be still the drum silent 
-PRON- hear the tinkle of shell fringe the hut of a chieftain stir by the wind 
the perfume of ylangylang waft to -PRON- nostril 
rouse -PRON- daken see woman weave flower garland in the soft green shade of a jungle clearing and among -PRON- sit gwanoo but a gwanoo subtly change from the savage sorcerer whose look have power to waken fear 
gwanoo play with flower 
the little monkey sit on -PRON- knee 
-PRON- lean against a tree bole and above -PRON- flower and hair in a reath of fresh garland hang phillip head 
daken look about the hut see -PRON- case of surgical instrument and the black metal box wrap in oilskin which hold -PRON- note 
then -PRON- try to recall the night in the hut the horror of the last day and look again at gwanoo 
the gauze bandage be go 
there be a scar across the broad forehead disappear240 e into the hair 
the eye be not those pierce beadlike jet 
the voice hold the soft womantone 
daken sit up and -PRON- movement bring a woman into the hut 
a moment later -PRON- have summon gwanoo who enter and sit crosslegge beside daken and hand -PRON- the box of note 
marster -PRON- sleep long time 
one two ree moon -PRON- sleep 
now -PRON- go out 
go out 
light leap in daken eye warmth flood -PRON- heart 
gwanoo have give -PRON- a lease of life of mercy of hope 
-PRON- feed -PRON- 
the woman massage -PRON- body with lemonscented oil as -PRON- have do for many day 
-PRON- impart the strength of -PRON- hand to -PRON- flesh and heal -PRON- 
gwanoo keep guard a gwanoo change a gwanoo womangentle 
the village of nipathatche hut be strangely devoid of man 
-PRON- learn from -PRON- talk that the warrior be hunt the contraband paradise plume and would be go many day and that -PRON- be to be send out before -PRON- return 
daken have lie for three month bereft of reason nurse by the command of gwanoo and at last -PRON- understand 
gwanoo s brain be leave in the lagoon hut 
the brain of the brown girl inhabit the head of the sorcerer 
yet before -PRON- leave daken carry the case of knife that be the instrument of this magic to where a long war canoe nose the blackshadowe lianas loop above the jungle stream and drop -PRON- into the depth 
never again would -PRON- use -PRON- surgeon skill for very fear of -PRON- cunning 
return -PRON- stand before the head of phillip and salute 
-PRON- speak not a word 
the tightsewn lip still grin at the joke of -PRON- all 
daken have one regret as -PRON- step into the canoe and look for the last time on the magnificent gwanoo with the soft eye of the bride of phillip that -PRON- would never know how the thing would end whether the warrior body of the sorcerer would in time absorb the womanbrain or the woman weaken the warrior 
-PRON- seem a pity -PRON- could not watch that phase but in a white man land a white girl wait and there be the note to work on and give to the world the most interesting of which could not be include in a precise and scholarly treatise such as -PRON- and phillip have plan 
the paddle dip 
the throat of black man take up the jungle song and float under the dark tree daken look -PRON- last at the grin tightsewn lip of -PRON- friend of phillip who have engineer so curiously the release of daken

and then as the egyptian draw the urchin close to -PRON- and advance to the center of the improvised stage an almost blindingly intense bluewhite light illuminate the room 
from overhead come a soft fluttering a faint hissing as the huge photographic light settle down to a steady glare pardon -PRON- for not inform -PRON- that the light be to be turn on mohamet ali jerry newman speak up almost forget -PRON-

the sword -PRON- lay upon the floor 
now gentleman if -PRON- will follow -PRON- closely with the word -PRON- grasp the end of the twine and toss the ball upward quickly 
a gasp go up from the little audience as -PRON- see the twine seemingly vanish through one of the great skylight indeed the skylight seem to have vanish for -PRON- could see out into the heaven 
overhead the rolling evening cloud pass in stately array and into -PRON- the twine disappear 
at a word from the egyptian the small boy clutch the twine in -PRON- hand and begin climb upward 
the astonished jerry gaze openmouthe as the urchin wriggle and squirm -PRON- way up that twine continue on until -PRON- too be sweep from sight by the lowhange cloud

frown ferociously quite obviously enrage at the boy refusal to obey -PRON- the egyptian stoopefl and seize the sword 
spawn of shaitan -PRON- snarl grasp the twine in -PRON- brown hand 
and then -PRON- too climb upward 
chin sag jerry newsman watch the egyptian follow the urchin into the cloud 
then the twine begin to sway to and fro violently 
from above come eird shriek shrill imploring for mercy then -PRON- be drown out by the lover tone of the voice snarl vicious 
an unearthly scream split asunder the silence in the room below a scream that set on edge each nerve in the body of the watcher 
drop of blood spatter on the carpet and a moment later an arm fall thud to the floor 
-PRON- be small slender darkskinne 
-PRON- be the urchin s arm follow another cry and the other arm strike sickeningly beside the first 
then before the horrified eye of the beholder in quick succession -PRON- see the urchin feet -PRON- dismember leg -PRON- head and then the bloody torso strike before -PRON- then from above mohamet ali come slip down the twine 
-PRON- land lightly on -PRON- foot beside the horrible disarray 
-PRON- would not obey -PRON- -PRON- say simply as -PRON- glance about -PRON- upon the gathering 
as if that end the matter -PRON- extend -PRON- foot and kick the dismember body into a pile 
the twine -PRON- grasp and give -PRON- a jerk so that -PRON- fall into -PRON- hand roll -PRON- up compactly

and with -PRON- finger old and brown -PRON- plait mat o rush and give -PRON- to the cottager -PRON- meet among the bush 
old meg be brave as margaret queen and tall as amazon an old red blanket cloak -PRON- wear a chip hat have -PRON- on 
god rest -PRON- aged bone somewhere -PRON- die full long agone 
bullet have fail and i be at the mercy of those leer horror 
i look back at the little village of kraanstaadt 
from the height -PRON- look more than ever like a fairytale village with -PRON- high peaked roof and wind street of stone 
even for that picturesque land of the hartz mountain -PRON- be delightful a very masterpiece and the grim old castle that brood in silence over -PRON- may well have house an ogre or some sleep princess 
strange little land of fairytale 
the very place that give rise to so many story of the little people live in -PRON- same tenor of way and fill with ancient custom that make one instinctively gaze into the sky for winged dragon fly carpet or even witch on broomstick 
the people be as superstitious as ever be mortal race 
-PRON- have beg -PRON- not to tramp the road to kraanstaadt and have hold up -PRON- hand in horror over -PRON- insisting on take the trail through the wood 
no no mine host of the tavern have cry be not so foolish for the wood be fill with awful thing 
and -PRON- wife dear old soul have clung to -PRON- arm with tear 
but i be not to be turn from -PRON- course of action 
the walk would take the well part of a day in the deep wood and give -PRON- even a well appetite than i already possess 
besides this be the land of romance and for one be not to be cheat of that 
to -PRON- argument therefore turn a deaf ear and prepare to go 
the good wife finally press upon -PRON- a crucifix and in order not to hurt -PRON- feeling i put -PRON- cord about -PRON- neck and the cross i button under -PRON- shirt 
i could feel -PRON- theie now and what be more to -PRON- liking could also feel the heavy under -PRON- armpit 
i be curious as to whether a werewolf may bow to the cross but not a bit doubtful as to whether -PRON- animal brother would respect the leaden pellet from the heavy gun 
so protect both physically and spiritually i stand and look down upon the little village and then turn i plunge into the woode trail 
i tramp until midday and then at a crossroad perhaps i should say erosstrail i sit down and eat the lunch i have bring with -PRON- 
the crosstrail mark the half of -PRON- journey and a few more hour would find -PRON- look down on -PRON- destination 
i light -PRON- pipe and finally with regret i leave the delightful spot and take the trail to the left as i have be direct 
the other be overgrow with weed and i make a promise in -PRON- heart that some day -PRON- would be explore 
tramp along i let -PRON- be lull by the soft forest air and in -PRON- mind i picture these strange wood dark and forbidding as -PRON- be with the actor of childish story halfremembere 
surely along the tiny trail ahead of -PRON- be walk the child the lose baby and the old witch s cabin would soon come in sight eagerly i look for the gnome and dwarfs and once a crackling in the brush bring -PRON- about to scan the forest for the sign of the wolf of red ride hood fame 
soon i leave the trail and sit down by a tree 
soothe by the hum of insect life and the day heat i soon fall asleep 
-PRON- be late afternoon when i spring up and gaze at -PRON- surrounding 
anger at -PRON- i at once make for the path and turn down -PRON- for i know now that -PRON- sluggish sleep have make -PRON- late and i be in no eager mood to be leave wander in wood i do not know through the evening and dark night 
hurriedly i pace the path with no more thought of the elfin folk with which -PRON- fancy have people the wood earlier in the day 
-PRON- be cold now a bite wind have spring up and dusk have begin to fall silently about -PRON- a fact that accelerate -PRON- speed in an endeavor to keep warm 
the path run and wound among the tree and in the grow darkness these lose -PRON- charm and instead of hidden prince change by the wave of a witch s wand into tower forest giant -PRON- seem more like the hideous monster of some forget era wait to pounce on the unwary traveler who stray from the path 
-PRON- seem too that behind -PRON- another presence pace and glance behind -PRON- in the grow dusk i see a white object melt into the tree on -PRON- right 
slowly i pick -PRON- way glance about -PRON- as i go and be soon reward by see -PRON- again for a moment as -PRON- slip between some tree trunk 
then i step across a little glade and draw -PRON- revolver slip behind a tree trunk and wait 
a few second pass and there step into view a monstrous white wolf that stalk across the tiny space 
i fire the deepen dusk be light by an orange flame as -PRON- revolver spat lead and the beast race into the tree with a snarl that tell -PRON- of a hit score 
but -PRON- hang grimly on for several time i see -PRON- glide through the tree although owe to -PRON- caution i be unable to get another chance to shoot 
then suddenly the path be cross by another 
i swear in -PRON- anger for mine host have tell -PRON- there be only one plaee where the trail be bisect by anything 
still here be another path well wear by the pass foot of a multitude for many year big and broad than the one i follow 
suddenly the question arise in -PRON- mind have i in -PRON- first few second of wakefulness retrace -PRON- step 
with this in view i examine the broad path before -PRON- and then turn to look at the one down which i have come 
the darkness however have so cover the ground that -PRON- have ishe and look as i may about -PRON- i could not discover -PRON- 
a moan creak draw -PRON- attention from the ground to the air above -PRON- head and i start back with an exclamation 
there only a few foot from -PRON- be erect a gibbet and upon -PRON- swing a dead man 
the wind which be rise rapidly swing -PRON- to and fro like a pendulum and the rope moan and complain 
so intent have i be upon the path that i have not notice -PRON- until that moment 
poor fellow i reflect have -PRON- perchance leave love arm and eye that weep behind -PRON- or have -PRON- face the world alone 
guilty or innocent have -PRON- face death bravely or go whimper to the great beyond or have -PRON- curse those who hang -PRON- 
a rustle from -PRON- shoulder and two little red eye glare at -PRON- turn -PRON- away shudder 
crow bird of evil oman follower of execution 
an old poem i have hear in -PRON- boyhood day come back to -PRON- out of the annal of year -PRON- shall sit on -PRON- breast on -PRON- broad manly breast and pick -PRON- eye out one by one 
i shudder and turn down the broad path 
surely the old custom of ancient day survive here if nowhere else 
hang a man at the crossroad 
-PRON- thought be bring back to earth by the cracking of brash to -PRON- right 
evidently the wolf be still there moon rise over the forest and the cloud race across the face of -PRON- in the rise gale 
-PRON- take odd shape one be shape like a coffin another take the form of some belate specter hurry to keep some dark tryst on a ruin castle battlement and one remember that very well change -PRON- shape into a skull with the moon pale ray glare through the empty socket 
the shadow fling on the ground by the passage of these cloud also have dire and forebidde outline 
the entire scene be in keep with the tale of the hartz mountain of ghost and hobgoblin sheet specter and hooded horror and all the evil spawn of hell that run through the tale of ancient germany 
i hurry onward hope at every curve or at the top of every hill to catch the light of the little town shine upon -PRON- but instead the dark forest continue on and on and hem in -PRON- path 
several hour must have pass this way and -PRON- be very close to midnight when i see shine through the tree a light to the right of the path 
here be shelter from the come storm crude and homely shelter no doubt but shelter for all of -PRON- crudeness and with a lightened heart i hurry toward -PRON- 
as i approach a broad beam of light show that someone have enter or leave and as i meet no one along the pathway as i hurry up i conclude the person have enter 
to -PRON- wonder on approach i find the unmistakable outline of an inn 
how very good -PRON- look i picture the warmth and coziness of the great room within for i be cold and chill by the night air 
i pause with -PRON- hand on the doorknob and look at the crazy little signboard overhead 
the moon come out from behind the cloud and send a broad ray across -PRON- and there arrange in two row of three each with a large one in the center be seven skull 
after the event of the night i be somewhat shake by the sight of those seven little emblem of mortality that grin down upon -PRON- in -PRON- deathly mirth but as the rain be begin to come down in torrent i shrug -PRON- shoulder and go in 
mine host may have -PRON- gruesome little joke but -PRON- fire be what i crave now and if -PRON- be good why the sign would be perhaps the center of a tale about the roar fireplace 
slam the door against the wind that push with a thousand tiny hand as though demand admittance i stand inside and blink the rain and darkness out of -PRON- eye 
the great fire roar up the fireplace light the room with a vivid fitful glow and show -PRON- the contour of the several guest that be gather near -PRON- 
ordinary peasant and forester -PRON- all seem to be and mine host in white apron and cap come smile toward -PRON- 
welcome mine friend -PRON- say in a throaty whisper the storm be indeed a bad one and -PRON- be very fortunate to have make -PRON- door 
while thank -PRON- for -PRON- offer of assistance and hospitality i look at -PRON- carefully 
-PRON- throat i notice be wrap with a heavy white cloth sure sign of a bad cold and this explain -PRON- queer way of speak 
-PRON- eye protrude fearfully from -PRON- face a sign of inward goiter so i have hear but altogether -PRON- be such a kindlyappeare person that i follow -PRON- with thankful heart to the fire warmth the other make room for -PRON- 
food there be none so i must perforce content -PRON- with the remain of -PRON- lunch to mine host utter sorrow 
however as -PRON- bring -PRON- some really good rhine wine i could not object 
-PRON- explanation be that this time of year -PRON- guest be scarce yet for several day -PRON- have have such an influx that -PRON- be eat out of house and home 
as i have plenty of food leave over i do not object and i be tell -PRON- not to worry -PRON- when a scratching begin at the door 
the tavernkeeper cross to -PRON- hurriedly and swing -PRON- wide admit as -PRON- do so the great white wolf that have stalk -PRON- through the wood 
-PRON- dear little girl -PRON- cry thou art overly late 
surely i have be very lonesome without thee 
-PRON- dog mein herr -PRON- continue in explanation 
savage to some yes but to -PRON- very gentle 
-PRON- stroke the great white head lift to -PRON- 
but what be this -PRON- cry 
ach -PRON- little darling have be wound in the shoulder see mein herr see how the blood have run 
ah those charcoalburner with -PRON- gun 
nothing be safe nothing 
and -PRON- run for warm water and towel to bathe the wound 
i believe -PRON- better to keep silent as to -PRON- share in the episode and sit watch -PRON- 
the beast whimper and cry and then when -PRON- master back be turn -PRON- swing upon -PRON- -PRON- red eye fill with hate and anger 
i loosen the pistol in -PRON- holster for dog or no dog the great creature would die do -PRON- rush -PRON- 
however -PRON- go to the fire opposite side as soon as the wound be dressed and there stretch out at full length in the heat 
-PRON- frugal repast be now finish i fall to study the different traveler at the inn 
there seem something odd about -PRON- that i be at first unable to place 
then -PRON- dawn upon -PRON- the costume even in this very old world -PRON- seem out of date 
the costume of a century or two ago i be delighted 
this be romance i could not see -PRON- foot on account of the shadow but i picture -PRON- as be incase in long hose run to trunk and surely those cape in the corner be of a pattern ah -PRON- sleep come the innkeeper voice 
-PRON- be tired then 
come let -PRON- show -PRON- to -PRON- room mine guest 
-PRON- be true indeed that soothe by the soft guttural and the fire glow i must have sleep so i allow -PRON- to light a candle and show -PRON- up the narrow stair in the back of the great room to -PRON- bedroom rain have cease but the cloud still run across the moon draw weird and fantastic shadow across the ground 
underneath -PRON- i could hear the voice and an occasional creak from the crazy sign 
i bolt -PRON- door and sit by the window watch -PRON- queer design 
sleep seem to have leave -PRON- and the room be bitterly cold yet i do not mind either of these thing so engrossed have i become in the wild night scene without 
suddenly a scratch come at the bedroom door bring -PRON- thought back with a snap to the present 
the great white wolf or dog have follow -PRON- 
i spring up and make sure of the doorfastening and at the soimd of -PRON- footstep -PRON- pad away limpingly 
poor beast 
i be sorry i have shoot -PRON- now but i have no inclination to explain matter especially in that narrow room 
i go back to the window and stand look out 
suddenly the candle behind -PRON- start to go out 
with an impatient oath i turn about 
the keeper have evidently give -PRON- a very short one as -PRON- think i would soon be asleep i think 
but no the candle be still quite long and yet -PRON- be die slowly as if for want of oxygen 
low and low go the light and then suddenly flicker and go out 
quickly i strike a match and go toward the candle but drop the match when something seize -PRON- arm 
at almost the same instant something else seize -PRON- leg and then i be grasp by numberless little hand ill the dark 
how can i describe that fight in the narrow room 
i be fill with disgust and loathing as well as horror 
little creature -PRON- appear to be that try to bear -PRON- down by weight of number 
i send -PRON- fist into face and feel tooth loosen under the driving blow hurl some from -PRON- and hear -PRON- strike with crash force against the side of the room and i crack skull with the butt end of -PRON- revolver 
still i be force back and back for -PRON- number seem legion and then weak and wear out i be force to the bed and bend back and back until i be fling upon -PRON- 
-PRON- shirt be tear open in the struggle and i bleed from a number of tiny wound yet still i fight grimly on with horror in -PRON- mind horror of these unseen foeman 
as -PRON- back touch the bed the moon spring out from behind a cloud and lie in a broad beam across -PRON- 
the tiny silver cross catch and reflect the ray and suddenly as -PRON- have commence the attack be withdraw -PRON- foeman vanish if -PRON- can call people who be never not even in the moonlight visible vanish and slowly as i lie spent and pant on the bed the candle begin to glow and finally spring into life 
slowly i stagger to -PRON- foot and stumble toward the door seek the companionship of those below 
under -PRON- foot i fall body body perfectly invisible to -PRON- even in the lamplight 
-PRON- never occur to -PRON- until later that those below should have hear the row go on over -PRON- head or that even the dull ear should have detect the uproar to which the smashed and broken furniture give testimony in that narrow room 
with weaken step i make -PRON- way down the dim hall and narrow stair and at the last turn i see with a glad heart the great room leap into sight 
mine host 
i cry mine host but then after i descend the few remain step with a rush -PRON- word choke in -PRON- throat and i stagger to the wall where i stand in horror 
the room be light by a red glow that seem to have no source 
the fire or for that matter any fire ever build -PRON- man could not have make the awful glare red that fill the entire room 
-PRON- sear and burn into the brain bring out every detail with startling distinctness and the traveler who now swing slowly around to face -PRON- be not human 
the face be the face of those long dead dead that live the undead of a century long past 
those clothe be the doublet and liosen of long ago long wicked sword hang at side the face 
ah the face be skull skull pick clean and white by the graveworm in molder tomb 
only the socket be fill with that reddish glare of hell that pervade the entire room 
the innkeeper eye still protrude from -PRON- socket but the bandage of a few hour earlier be go and -PRON- neck be twist and break the face be that of a newly hung man with the horror of death still upon -PRON- 
under -PRON- horrorstricken scrutiny the lineament change and -PRON- become a skull a horrid grinning skull like the other only the twist neck remain awry and the vertebra show jag beneath the leer deathmask 
a growl bring -PRON- terrorfille eye to the white wolf that sit by the fire 
slowly -PRON- stand up on -PRON- hind leg like a train animal and then hellish and terrible a transformation take place 
the body grow to a great height the long cruel snout vanish the beastlike property be slowly banish one by one and human line take -PRON- place until a girl stand glare at -PRON- 
a girl a demon from hell dark pit with eye of reddish hate a werewolf one of the truly undead 
i crouch in -PRON- corner as the awful face turn toward -PRON- and draw -PRON- weapon 
the werewolf move toward -PRON- -PRON- right arm dangling and then i send shoot after shot into the throng to no avail 
bullet have fail and i be at the mercy of these leer horror 
in fear and horror i run -PRON- hand up -PRON- bosom toward -PRON- throat and feel beneath -PRON- trembling finger the tiny cross 
swiftly i tear -PRON- shirt open and hold the emblem toward -PRON- as i cry back back -PRON- fiend 
evil i fear not the wolf recoil and the face of the other turn toward each other as though in whisper consultation 
so death take council while a madman wave a silver cross face -PRON- rank 
slowly -PRON- arise and come toward -PRON- and form a hideous circle in front of -PRON- 
the thing have decide i suppose to frighten -PRON- into drop the little cross and then i feel -PRON- sense go -PRON- hand be tremble and dark little mote begin dance before -PRON- eye the wall reel about -PRON- and the only solid substance in the universe be that leer crowd of deathmask with the white hatefilled face of the fiend in girlish form that ring -PRON- in 
the red light seem to glow and then to fade as i fight for the mastery of -PRON- mind a white glow flood the scene somewhere i seem to hear a cock crow and then as fall i hear a shriek as of some baffle fiend who hear the fall of a curtain of safety between -PRON- and the victim upon which -PRON- claw have be so nearly lay eat afternoon have come when i i i open -PRON- eye and find -PRON- on a rude cot in entirely different surrounding 
an old man whose face be kindly rise from the fire and come toward -PRON- with some gruel in -PRON- hand 
drink this and sleep -PRON- say yon be in safe hand at last -PRON- friend 
for several day i tarry with the charcoalburner and -PRON- stalwart son in the rude little shelter -PRON- call home and draw from -PRON- the tale of the inn and -PRON- occupant that i now set down 
for year the inn have lie on a welltravele thoroughfare in the hartz mountain and well along in the sixteenth century have be the stop place for many a noble and knight 
then karl the terrible have buy -PRON- and gather about -PRON- a crew of murderer and slayer 
-PRON- be credit with have traffic with the devil and -PRON- only sister have surpass -PRON- in all evil finally become so the story run a werewolf 
traveler be murder by -PRON- creature and -PRON- body hide in the cellar 
tale of scream and cry be circulate until -PRON- come at length to the baron of the district one hoerlarin of kraanstaadt 
-PRON- at length with a goodly gathering of and knight have one day suddenly appear at the inn and capture karl and -PRON- man 
the sister have escape 
the trial have be swift and sure for very little digging bring the bone in the cellar to light 
punishment have follow as swiftly 
the many follower have be tie to the bed of the inn and burn alive in -PRON- conflagration karl be take to the crossroad and hang so that all may see and fear but the sister be never find 
the road fall into disuse even as the great castle at kraanstaadt have crumble and become dark 
yet the ruin of the inn blacken and sear by the purge fire still contain evil quality and there night after night have gather the evil crew for ghastly carousal body swing at the old crossroad until moonrise when -PRON- descend and join -PRON- old companion and often the white form of a werewolf be see as -PRON- slip between the tree trunk toward the den of hell 
in the blacken ruin i have be find for the shot of the night before have be hear and investigate by the two charcoalburner 
perhaps i dream the horror perhaps the people of the hartz mountain be merely superstitious yokel who frighten -PRON- with needless tale of horror perhaps -PRON- the reader of this tale will smile but i wonder what make -PRON- hair turn white and why the little mark of claw upon -PRON- body have never leave for one have never go back to that haunted area and i place -PRON- faith upon the belief of the strange peasant of the hartz mountain 
a tale of the olga boatman by paviloff russia may algernon downe esq st jame row london england mr downe i be write to let -PRON- know that i be resign -PRON- position as foreman of the man work on the dam here at paviloff 
-PRON- reason for so do be a most unusual one indeed and no doubt -PRON- will feel obliged to discredit -PRON- nor can i blame -PRON- for do so for even i be tempt to disregard the indubitable evidence of -PRON- own sense so bizarre be the event that have lead up to this culmination of -PRON- effort here 
let -PRON- assure -PRON- have i know of what i be face at the outset of this project should never have enter upon any contract with -PRON- 
on the twentyfourth of february last -PRON- representative mr solar hamilton of oxford arrive to confer with mr randeur and -PRON- on the building of the dam across the volga at this point 
present at this meeting as a professor sergei bourskymaminoff late of the university of moscow and a former pupil of metchnikoff 
-PRON- be here to represent the peasant of paviloff and the surround country 
professor bourskymaminofif relate the story of peculiar superstition strongly believe by the peasant and -PRON- admit that -PRON- also believe in -PRON- owe -PRON- say to certain curious happening border directly on these superstition 
mr randeur scoff at -PRON- mr hamilton enjoy -PRON- immensely throughout the professor entire relation but these tale of -PRON- have an odd effect upon -PRON- from the beginning 
-PRON- seem that the peasant believe the volga river be guard by spirit who will rise up against -PRON- if -PRON- attempt to stay the course of the river in any manner 
-PRON- will say as do randeur that the idea be utterly preposterous 
i admit that -PRON- do sound preposterous 
professor warn -PRON- repeatedly to go and leave the river but randeur could not consider the idea 
finally the professor depart in anger 
i endeavor to argue with randeur and hamilton but both of -PRON- ridicule -PRON- 
at length mr hamilton leave say as -PRON- ent that if i do not wish to stay -PRON- would see that another man would be send to fill the vacancy 
please notify mr hamilton to supply that other man 
god know what prompt randeur to do so rash a thing but -PRON- build -PRON- cottage on a little knoll almost directly in the course of the river 
everyone fear that if the dam should suddenly go out randeur s cottage would go out with -PRON- 
one day not long ago the twentyseventh of april to be exact as professor bourskymaminoff stand on this knoll rebuke randeur for -PRON- rash act and again warn -PRON- to watch for the river spirit a most repulsive hunchback approach the two man scream at the top of -PRON- voice the boatman sing tonight 
the boatman sing tonight 
this in -PRON- be an odd occurrence but -PRON- develop that the hunchback be quite mad and so randeur again scoff at what the professor say 
the boatman that the hunchback refer to be the fj host of those slavish man or rather halfman halfbeast who be treat as animal by the nobility of russia the man force to pull the heavily laden boat of the nobility up the volga 
there be no such boatman now although -PRON- still exist in randeur question professor bourskymaminoff and -PRON- learn that the peasant believe that whenever the boatman sing -PRON- be a sign of death 
the professor tell randeur that -PRON- singing have never fail to bring death 
of course -PRON- can well imagine what an effect this have on randeur none at all 
-PRON- wave -PRON- away but on the follow day randolph smith -PRON- good patrolman apparently accidentally fall from the framework at the extreme outer edge of the dam into the swirl current below and be whisk away in the space of a moment 
i say apparently because -PRON- do not know 
randeur be stun for a moment but -PRON- blame -PRON- upon coincidence 
however -PRON- endeavor to keep -PRON- from professor bourskymaminoff but the professor hear of -PRON- and come directly to randeur and again implore -PRON- to cease -PRON- task 
but randeur would hear none of -PRON- 
last night while the professor be speak to -PRON- manager the hunchback come again shriek -PRON- unearthly warning 
and even as -PRON- speak the professor pale and mutter that -PRON- too hear -PRON- chant in the distance and -PRON- look at the river but there be nothing there 
and today mr down the entire left end of the dam have go out the strong side wipe out completely 
and the man have all quit but randeur be still there -PRON- be go to build that dam -PRON- say hope that -PRON- will soon find a man to fill the unfortunate vacancy leave by -PRON- i remain very cordially and sincerely yours nemo lawlor andeur see the last of -PRON- man leave -PRON- and -PRON- move angrily toward the cottage 
-PRON- sit there some time mumble over -PRON- chart and plan 
after a while -PRON- come out and look about -PRON- up at the remainder of the dam and at the river flow e by as peacefully as ever and at the sky to see if there be any sign of storm but the sky be clear and away in the distance in the purple haze about the mountain the full moon be rise 
and -PRON- look toward the town and there -PRON- see what -PRON- dread to see the dark figure of the mad hunchback move toward -PRON- over the sand 
-PRON- stand very quietly until the figure come up to -PRON- 
-PRON- eye be wide with excitement and -PRON- straggly hair frame a pockmarked face -PRON- huge distend nose squat above -PRON- thin bloodless lip like a vulture over some halfdevoured corpse -PRON- lip open and close as -PRON- come and -PRON- three remain tooth be display in -PRON- rotting gum -PRON- clothe be dirty rag and -PRON- wear neither shoe nor stocking 
the ungainly hump on -PRON- back stick out prominently 
-PRON- speak in a nervous frenzy of fury 
the boatman chant again tonight 
do -PRON- hear -PRON- 
death be in the air 
death and the river seethe in anger and -PRON- will rise against -PRON- tonight 
and -PRON- be alone in the path of the river death randeur curse -PRON- and raise -PRON- hand in a threatening gesture 
the hunchback speed away and as -PRON- run -PRON- shout and randeur hear the ominous cry echo far jn the distance 
death 
death 
death 
and a harsh laugh sound after -PRON- and randeur shudder 
-PRON- be fifteen minute past by random s watch when -PRON- start 
randeur do not notice the splashing of the wave until after some time have pass 
then suddenly a shutter bang against the side of the cottage and -PRON- start up from -PRON- blueprint and peer anxiously out into the night 
the full moon ride high in the sky and there be not even a fleece in the blue as far as -PRON- could see 
but the shutter have bang -PRON- have hear -PRON- 
and even as -PRON- look wonderingly out the shutter bang against the housewall for the second time and immediately after another shutter bang and another and another until randeur rush madly for the door but before -PRON- reach -PRON- -PRON- be fling violently open 
-PRON- halt for a moment then run out and turn look fearfully back at the accursed cottage 
but now all be silent the shutter sag listlessly on -PRON- illfastened hinge and the door stand half open 
there be no hint of a breeze the night be oppressively hot 
-PRON- stare at the cottage until some inner sense beat upon -PRON- mind turn -PRON- head slowly toward the river 
and there -PRON- see a multitude of white shape indistinguishable fantastic ominous 
and as -PRON- look at -PRON- move slowly up the river toward the dam -PRON- become conscious of a loud sound as of the beating of the wave and -PRON- see the river rise and swell and a thousand white foamy wave lash the air in fury 
and from some far point in the distance come the low sound of a hymn 
randeur listen terrorstricken 
and as -PRON- stare at the white shape almost at the dam -PRON- ear seem to open and -PRON- hear in mighty chorus upward onward -PRON- be one 
randeur clap -PRON- hand over -PRON- ear so that -PRON- may not hear that presentiment of death the song of the volga boatman but the toiler mock -PRON- effort and raise -PRON- voice and sing louder loud loud 
and the wave rise high and high and the song increase in volume and randeur stand root to the ground upon the knoll on which -PRON- have foolishly suppose -PRON- to be safe 
suddenly that same inner sense turn -PRON- head upward so that -PRON- could see the right side of the dam and -PRON- see -PRON- crumble and vanish in the upheaval of water that follow 
and -PRON- seem as if -PRON- eye be suddenly open for -PRON- see the spirit of the river push the water toward -PRON- and -PRON- see too the moon shine tranquilly down upon the seething water before -PRON- close -PRON- eye in a vain effort to shut out the scene before -PRON- 
and -PRON- hear the song of the boatman rise and fall ominous terrible upward onward -PRON- be one sound do i hear during the might but the river have avenge -PRON- for the wrong that have be do to -PRON- 
the professor point to the jagged spar that be catch in the crotch of a giant willow that stand upon the knoll where a cottage have once be 
-PRON- be all that be leave of everything that have be here 
death have come and go 
and from somewhere in back of the crowd of peasant that gaze in silent awe upon the calm river come the voice of the mad hunchback in wild echo to the professor death death death 
-PRON- be the mad hunchback who find randeur two day later far down the river among the reed and rush that grow thickly there 
randeur s bloated face tell of the ghastly thing -PRON- have see -PRON- bloodless lip be part and tightly draw -PRON- hair be tear as if in a frenzy of despair and -PRON- widely open eye stare upward in mute nameless horror 
strange power have this belt of human skin the girdle by pool of mottle light on the tabletop have drift over to where sir elawlike finger emerge from the silk sleeve of -PRON- dress robe drum slowly on the black oak 
carson erect on the hearth rug have ignore the chair indicate by the finger and be fill with a sudden resentment as -PRON- sense the indifferent weariness of -PRON- tapping 
and this old man be father 
-PRON- be all so different than -PRON- have picture 
there as no fathom the expression of that masklike face with -PRON- impenetrable stare settle in the cushioned depth of the wheel chair 
the heel of boot come together with a suggestion of military stiffness and -PRON- speak curtly confes i donot understand 
and -PRON- host reply in a curiously dry voice -PRON- be not altogether necessary that -PRON- should 
the word carry a study courtesy but -PRON- veiled irony be not lose on the officer

here be the final chapter of the star shell by and the story so far arry william mark dexter and prince danda singh be catapult to jupiter in spaceship the star shell through the treachery of professor norden 
after terrific adventure in the forest of the great red weed -PRON- be rescue from the midst of the barbarian horde that be try to overrun jupiter and take by civilized man of jupiter in a jovian airship toward nadir which be besiege by barbarian horde arm with the green fire 
rp battle say that mean delius that -PRON- pie have take -PRON- advice and intend to fight for -PRON- life in real earnest 
glad to hear -PRON- 
but -PRON- be not glad solitarian 
the slaughter will be great a necessity -PRON- be true but a most painful and sorrowful one 
yet the queen have decide upon instant and unstinted action and those elder who attend -PRON- council have approve -PRON- decision 
within an hour of -PRON- landing in nadir the order be give and -PRON- force set in motion but not until -PRON- be despatch to -PRON- aid 
-PRON- wirelesse -PRON- but receive no response 
thing be move rapidly to the great crisis of -PRON- history 
though the barbarian will have to go without megalof -PRON- be lead by skilled general and be in overpower number and -PRON- intend to force the passage of the isthmus of cardiac even at the cost of countless life 
once -PRON- be master of that strip of land between -PRON- two great continent -PRON- civilized city and plain right up to the defense of the ridged hill be at -PRON- mercy 
ostrong who would have -PRON- retire to the hill at once have be ask to resign from the council 
resign 
only that and nothing more 
i cry 
the old scoundrel ought at least to be give penal servitude 
delius shake -PRON- head calmly donot know exactly what penal servitude be but -PRON- be doubtless something dreadful 
-PRON- do not share -PRON- idea of revenge remember 
wo have virtually dismiss ostrong from authority but more than that -PRON- can not do 
-PRON- act accord to -PRON- own judgment and -PRON- think -PRON- be wrong and that s the end of -PRON- 
a man of -PRON- proud spirit will suffer greatly from -PRON- sense of failure 
-PRON- jovian be the limit say all the same i shall be very much surprize from what i see of mr ostrong if this be the end of -PRON- 
i think there be quite a lot of natural earthly malice about the old bird 
about the isthmus put in mark 
-PRON- people by virtue of the heat ray be supreme on the water though -PRON- donot use -PRON- much -PRON- sweep the isthmus from both side with ray from sea vessel the shore can keep that way but the effective range of the blue ray be too short to reach halfway across the neck of land 
and the barbarian have lately use some great engine for throw stone and basket of flow green fire re259 ply oberon 
machine on the lever and spring principle 
by these thing -PRON- have sink some of -PRON- sea fleet and even destroy one of -PRON- airship 
sound interesting say mark yawning 
but -PRON- for a good sleep 
wake -PRON- when -PRON- get there 
dandy and i be just as sleepy and while the airship speed on over forest and sea and plain fly straight as an arrow to -PRON- mark -PRON- go off into deep slumber 
after -PRON- experience in malador after a spell of short day and night -PRON- be quite easy 
-PRON- be become use to the unusual harden to anything 
-PRON- oke -PRON- when nadir be in sight and the two vessel be sw oope clown to the landing area in the city of spire 
-PRON- have cross the isthmus and the belt of smoke conflict 
as -PRON- speed slacken -PRON- throw open the door and the busy sound of life come up to -PRON- the purr of traffic the song of fearless bird 
and with the sound when -PRON- land come the faint sweet perfume of flower and blossom fruit 
if -PRON- donot fight for this -PRON- deserve all -PRON- be likely to get be -PRON- unspoken comment 
delius smile 
-PRON- be very easy to read some kind of thought -PRON- observe 
have no fear for -PRON- now that the queen have assume command 
-PRON- advice too will be readily welcome more especially since -PRON- risk -PRON- life in save -PRON- 
-PRON- will find -PRON- elder and scientist eager to work with -PRON- 
-PRON- may be as -PRON- wise teacher be say that -PRON- stranger from another planet have be send by the great power of the universe to preserve -PRON- race in -PRON- horn of peril 
steady with the bouquet 
i protest 
-PRON- have only hand -PRON- common sense 
and here -PRON- be 
-PRON- step out of the ship to meet a quiet wellbehaved but nevertheless very eager ciowd of jovian dignitary and officer among whom be the queen 
every few minute swift motor vehicle laden with recharge rayprojector dash out of the city to the battle line fifty mile away 
already solitarian say queen brisei look rather tenderly at mark i fancy -PRON- have act upon some of -PRON- idea and hint 
-PRON- war car be hold back the barbarian and -PRON- warship of the water and air be attack -PRON- 
within the last hour some of -PRON- chemist have manufacture an explosive mixture that act upon concussion 
a hundred of what -PRON- call bomb be now ready and thousand of -PRON- skilled worker be produce more 
-PRON- shall see the fight for yourself for -PRON- presence will encourage -PRON- force against the reckless bravery of the enemy 
so after muchneeded refreshment and a bath in aromatic water from the municipal supply -PRON- board an aerial warship for the isthmus 
-PRON- vessel carry a couple ef heat ray projector and fifty of the new shell 
-PRON- like old time be say prince danda 
-PRON- may almost be back on earth set out in airship to upon the foe drop bomb 
-PRON- very homelike be a few minute -PRON- be hover above the isthmus of cardiac hang high in air survey the scene through the transparent metal wall of -PRON- vessel 
-PRON- be look down upon the great battle in all the history of jupiter 
-PRON- be a strange sight 
the isthmus be a narrow neck of land between two great continent and two great ocean 
to east and west stretch land to north and south as far as the eye could see a glittering expanse of water 
across this narrow portant strip the fight rage 
from eastward pour the barbarian a surge flood of rough sinewy primitively armed humanity 
the westward end of the isthmus be hold by the civilized jovian equip with weapon far superior but in number far less 
-PRON- wasnot a bit like france or flander or the dardanelle 
there be no line of trench no dugout no shellhole no wire entanglement no bursting shell no humming airplane 
there be row of isolated fort row of low white dome from each of which flash the deadly blue ray 
against and between these dome fort the flood of barbarian press 
-PRON- be reckless to the verge of frenzy fling -PRON- forward as though perfectly careless of life 
already behind -PRON- front lie three row of the fort capture or destroy and only two row remain 
green fire smoke all across the isthmus be carry forward by thousand of man in little brazier be hurl at the fort by huge catapult 
in and out of the line of fort assist -PRON- effect dash the warcar oppose the blue ray to the green fire 
from each side of the isthmus sea vessel keep the shore elear and airship armed like -PRON- own save for the bomb swoop low plow lane of death across the savage horde with -PRON- burning ray 
but though the advance barbarian fall by thousand ten of thousand push the front rank on 
never have -PRON- fight like this before say delius who have come with -PRON- 
-PRON- be enrage that -PRON- be withstand -PRON- so stubbornly after -PRON- many victory 
if -PRON- can not hold -PRON- back till the frenzy pass i fear -PRON- be lose 
-PRON- race be pay for -PRON- past weakness say mark 
-PRON- have give way before -PRON- so often that -PRON- have come to think -PRON- invincible 
anyhow -PRON- will try the effect of -PRON- sort of fighting now i say 
put -PRON- across the isthmus slowly delius 
just as i speak a whirl mass of fire shoot from a gigantic throwingmachine catch one of the lowswooping airship 
the shock cause the vessel to turn turtle and -PRON- fall to the ground green flame curl round -PRON- 
-PRON- be too high for that danger but not too high to avenge the loss cry dandy hurl out the first bomb 
ah that most surprizing be 
-PRON- have not yet witness the effect of the new explosive nor be -PRON- prepare for the result of the jovian chemist first venture though -PRON- know -PRON- action would have to be strong to overcome the great gravitation of the big planet 
-PRON- be strong 
there be first a blind flash of light that seem to scorch -PRON- eye then a huge upheaval of the ground a volcanic burst of smoke and then a quiver of the air a roar of noise that shake the airship in every bolt and plate and make -PRON- eardrum throb with intense agony 
and when the smoke cloud blow away in the gale there be a shellhole big enough to bury a dozen house 
hundred of dead barbarian lie around the edge of the jagged pit and three of the catapult be smash to fragment 
-PRON- knock into a cocked hat 
i shout 
this stuff will win the war 
but -PRON- be terrible awful nerveracking say delius shudder and close -PRON- eye 
the butchery the slaughter 
-PRON- be now or never -PRON- life or your civilization or barbarism say mark 
ready harry 
then overboard with the steel pill dose one every ten minute 
let go and across the isthmus -PRON- sail drop down -PRON- rain of death -PRON- cross the isthmus of cardiac drop -PRON- bomb into the smoking battle line and before the last shell have tear up the tortured ground the battle be win 
civilization have triumph on jupiter at last 
after the sudden scare of the first explosion the barbarian rally gamely rush forward more frantically than before shoot flight of arrow into the sky in vain rage but -PRON- could not stand the repeat shock 
-PRON- line break -PRON- catapult destroy hundred of -PRON- blow to bit with every shellburst and the swoop airship sweep the fierce blue ray over -PRON- ceaselessly -PRON- give way at last lose -PRON- nerve and throw down -PRON- weapon as -PRON- go trample underfoot the officer who would have stay -PRON- run away in headlong panic 
the eivilized jovian rouse for once to energetic action pursue the struggle horde by air and land and -PRON- drop -PRON- last bomb in the thick part of the beat mob 
then -PRON- go back for another supply and drop fifty more shell amongst the route savage 
at least -PRON- ought to have be fifty count -PRON- i only make -PRON- fortynine 
when the pursuit eease the bar barian have be drive wholly elear of the dispute neck of land 
the isthmus of cardiac be safe in eivilize keep aixd the city nadir the lovely city of sweet garden and tapering spire be once more secure 
-PRON- story of the next few day must be rather short and serappv 
-PRON- isnot so easy to live all the time in the limelight so to speak and -PRON- rather embarrassing to sing one own praise even at second hand 
as i say one evening when -PRON- three be alone for a few minute snake and tiger mark 
-PRON- be now and forever the big noise here 
if -PRON- werenot extremely modest and the jovian werenot really civilize -PRON- head would be bulge like balloon and if wo weneaat keep so busy as well harry 
i know -PRON- two be about sick of -PRON- all and ready for home but -PRON- will have to grin and bear with -PRON- jovian and s a little long 
for one thing as jupiter and the earth have move in -PRON- orbit since -PRON- arrive -PRON- be not in a good position for the return journey 
if -PRON- start at a wrong time or in too great a hurry -PRON- may not be able to stop or to reach the earth -PRON- may drop into the sun and be frizzle up 
and there be norden to consider 
-PRON- be a problem 
-PRON- say -PRON- wonot return and -PRON- can hardly compel -PRON- 
nor caii -PRON- leave -PRON- here 
then there be -PRON- work the completion of the isthmus defense the casting of the big gun the starting of the smallarm factory 
besides all this simply revel in interesting discovery soak up science from -PRON- learn friend 
and -PRON- must admit that -PRON- be make -PRON- very comfortable 
especially the queen i grin 
-PRON- would if -PRON- want to stay here -PRON- certainly canot go without -PRON- 
all the same the novelty be wear off and -PRON- be feel a bit homesick for the earth 
these folk be all right in -PRON- way -PRON- can t do too much for -PRON- because -PRON- happen to come along and give -PRON- a help hand but after all -PRON- be out of -PRON- element here 
-PRON- have not taste meat for a week nor have a smoke nor see a policeman nor read a newspaper nor play any sort of game 
when -PRON- blow the engine whistle markie boy -PRON- shall have -PRON- ticket ready 
norden be indeed a problem remark prince danda 
-PRON- -PRON- annoy that -PRON- be at liberty as well as old ostrong 
-PRON- much together be and often with the barbarian prisoner be confab 
-PRON- plan mischief i much fear plain the old chap have never forgive -PRON- for buck up -PRON- race to fight and win say -PRON- would rather stick to the old tradition that -PRON- be more civilized to die in innocence than to live in forcible triumph 
-PRON- must watch -PRON- 
but what can -PRON- do or norden either ask mark 
-PRON- didnot know -PRON- couldnot imagine 
-PRON- be destine to find out later to what depth of evil a perverted virtue may descend 
in the meantime -PRON- have a feast of enjoyable experience even while -PRON- cast longing thought across the black void to the distant little planet of -PRON- birth the twinkling little star -PRON- see but now and then in the evening twilight through brief rift in the heavy cloud that enwrap giant jupiter 
though the jovian be so extremely scientific and civilized -PRON- home life be simple 
-PRON- have very little personal luxury and during the whole of -PRON- stay on the planet -PRON- never see any sign of poverty amongst -PRON- host 
everyone work at something everyone seem to have enough to eat drink and wear and the public service of light heating water supply transport sanitation and amusement be wonderfully efficient 
strike be unknown 
i have tell -PRON- of -PRON- naturalcolor picture 
-PRON- be show marvelous glimpse of scenery on the scene and later in -PRON- express airship -PRON- be show the scenery -PRON- 
i could write page and page of description of the lovely river valley the sandy shore and rocky coast the range of forestclad hill the vast desert the region of bubble geyser and fiery volcanos that diversify the surface of jupiter but -PRON- may not be as interested in the reading of -PRON- as -PRON- be in see -PRON- 
even -PRON- grow tired of travel of sightseeing and presently -PRON- have something else to think about 
delius take mark aside one evening very mysteriously and after -PRON- have have a long conversation -PRON- chum come over to dandy and -PRON- look rather red in the face 
wc didnot need to put -PRON- question into word shall have to tell -PRON- two what delius have be say poor old mark jerk out so i may as well get -PRON- over about the queen and ostrong and -PRON- 
-PRON- seem old ostrong have -PRON- eye on the queen think -PRON- be go to marry -PRON- in fact 
-PRON- turn -PRON- down of course be a sensible woman 
the mischief be that -PRON- have take a fancy to -PRON- instead and -PRON- donot altogether dislike the idea i finish for -PRON- afraid that s the size of -PRON- admit mark 
at least as to the first item 
-PRON- can leave -PRON- out of this if -PRON- please 
-PRON- put -PRON- in an awkward position have -PRON- knife into -PRON- now for more reason than one 
-PRON- ought to be off home before the mischief go any farther for even 
i well even if i want to marry briseis the thing impossible 
-PRON- be much old than i be the difference between -PRON- race be enormous and the council would not allow -PRON- 
-PRON- have actually have meeting and discuss the whole business in all -PRON- bearing 
ugh cheer up old pal i say 
-PRON- isnot everybody who jump several hundred million mile to find -PRON- queen 
-PRON- be hard line not to be allow to become a king but i agree with -PRON- friend that the idea be preposterous 
fact be -PRON- have well leave 
that also do i think add prince danda 
-PRON- people in india will for -PRON- be look soon have tell delius -PRON- shall go say mark with a sigh 
the star shell be quite repair ready fit and fully provision 
as i tell -PRON- a few day ago -PRON- be the position of the earth and jupiter that do not make the journey suitable or safe at present 
i be go into the detail with -PRON- astronomical expert tomorrow 
-PRON- may be necessary to wait a couple of month for the chance of start the trip with any degree of certainty 
-PRON- have to let -PRON- go at that but the thought be disturbing and not one of -PRON- sleep well that night guest house that have be place at -PRON- disposal be a nice little bungalow sort of building in the suburb of nadir where after darkness fall there as scarcely a sound to break the restful peace of the night 
in the long sleeping apartment -PRON- each have hammock in curtain recess 
i have doze off for the third time when a sudden tapping at the metal window rouse -PRON- with a jerk 
i press the switch that make the metal sheet transparent and another that flood the big room with light 
professor norden be at the window beckoning apparently in a state of considerable excitement 
i throw on a few rag rouse the other and let -PRON- in 
no time to lose if -PRON- want to help -PRON- cry anxiously go to destroy -PRON- destroy what norden who ask mark roughly 
the fellow have keep out of -PRON- way persistently since -PRON- return from matador and the red forest 
the shell 
the star shell the professor shout in a sort of frenzy 
ostrong 
want -PRON- to assist -PRON- 
afterward -PRON- be go to give -PRON- another spaceship one that would come to grief when on the way back to earth 
-PRON- have some of the prisoner help -PRON- 
i couldnot do -PRON- so i come to warn -PRON- 
quick i have a car wait 
well telephone the authority fiist i suggest 
i have already do so cry the professor 
come there be no time to waste 
half asleep yet and take off -PRON- guard by -PRON- manner -PRON- rush out of the house and follow norden into the auto 
a swift run through dark and silent avenue bring -PRON- to the aerial landing ground the professor talk fast and furiously all the way 
-PRON- be a clever scoundrel 
as -PRON- step out of the auto at the base of the star shell -PRON- think -PRON- be ready for any emergency 
-PRON- expect to find a fight go on between the aero guard and barbarian prisoner 
all be quiet black and still and eery as night but as -PRON- foot touch the ground a swarm of dark figure rise up and materialize out of every dense shadow 
in a few minute in spite of -PRON- struggle -PRON- be all helpless in the grasp of sinewy barbarian 
an increase crowd of the menacing prisoner gather round 
from another car which have follow -PRON- ostrong step alone 
the glare of the solitary electric lamp that light the open space gleam oddly on -PRON- mop of silvergray hair 
-PRON- smile grimly and lose no time get to the point 
-PRON- aie indeed wonderful being solitarian but the end of -PRON- interference have come at last 
-PRON- have mislead -PRON- people 
-PRON- have demoralize -PRON- moral nature in order to gain for -PRON- a material advantage 
if -PRON- remain alive -PRON- may indeed conquer the whole of -PRON- planet but -PRON- race would lose -PRON- soul would cease to be truly civilized 
-PRON- must die and perhaps -PRON- influence may yet prevail 
prisoner do -PRON- work 
-PRON- captor push -PRON- toward the star shell norden with -PRON- in spite of -PRON- protest and struggle 
-PRON- crowd upon -PRON- each man carry a block of some dark substance 
whilst some hold -PRON- rigidly other build up these block into a roughly circular wall around both -PRON- and the shell 
the wall grow as if by magic build by hundred of willing hand 
soon -PRON- be up to -PRON- waist and then those who be hold -PRON- free -PRON- and vault over 
-PRON- could not follow for everywhere -PRON- meet the point of sword and spear 
and still in silence and semidarkness the wall grow 
norden shout angry question but no one answer -PRON- the idea ostrong ask mark quietly 
-PRON- be quite simple solitarian be the old man reply 
this wall be build of block of the green metal collect from the battlefield by the prisoner at -PRON- suggestion 
presently -PRON- shall set -PRON- blaze and soon after sunrise nothing will remain of -PRON- and -PRON- spaceship but a heap of smolder ember 
there be no escape -PRON- can receive no help why be i here scream the professor in terrified rage be no friend of these other 
i have not help -PRON- i have help -PRON- in all -PRON- plan 
but for -PRON- -PRON- would not have lure -PRON- here so easily 
let -PRON- come out let -PRON- out shut up -PRON- miserable bounder say -PRON- have be a tool for the old villain and now -PRON- have no further use for -PRON- all 
-PRON- speak truly solitarian observed ostrong smile 
one use dangerous tool at time but one throw -PRON- away afterward 
i have quite do with mr norden 
jupiter will be well rid of -PRON- all 
and of -PRON- especially eld add mark though i doubt whether the queen will tolerate -PRON- existence after this night 
at any rate stranger -PRON- will never look at -PRON- again be the vindictive reply of the old man 
light the fire barbarian 
-PRON- will be revenge on the bad enemy of -PRON- race and i shall see the end of those who would corrupt the soul of -PRON- people 
light the fire in a few minute -PRON- will be beyond all help even if the whole city be rouse to try and save -PRON- 
light the fire 
those be the last word -PRON- hear speak by an inhabitant of jupiter 
the crowd of barbarian have go about -PRON- work eagerly but grimly silent and in the same grim silence -PRON- kindle spark and set the green metal blazing in a score of place 
with lightning rapidity the flame spread curl in bright green wave over the encircle wall pour in greet cascade between the loosely pile block 
volume of green smoke rise lazily to the dark sky 
-PRON- be cut off from everything by a ring of smoke and flame 
pale green tongue of fire come reach inward lick up the dry herbage greedily stretch out toward -PRON- and the shell 
the affair be well plan well carry out 
before long -PRON- know from what -PRON- have see of the radioflaming of the green metal everything within that terrible circle would be utterly consume 
-PRON- have well jump through -PRON- and die fighting say in desperation 
that i think also say dandy be ready 
norden in a frenzy of sheer terror grovel on the ground at the base of the shell moan and groaning 
-PRON- take no notice of -PRON- 
there be a well way out though -PRON- be a risky one say mark 
ostrong do not calculate everything 
into the shell with -PRON- all 
-PRON- be now get so uncomfortably hot and the smoke so pungent that -PRON- lose no time hop up the stair 
mark be the last 
on the threshold of the doorway lie stop 
-PRON- canot leave norden down there -PRON- chap can -PRON- 
-PRON- will have to come along and take -PRON- chance with -PRON- 
so back -PRON- go for the professor all of -PRON- cough with the smoke and smarting from the rain of spark that swirl around -PRON- 
norden be not grateful -PRON- be too scared to move 
when -PRON- insist -PRON- yell scream cry that the star shell be a deathtrap struggle like a madman 
finally i give -PRON- a tap on the head to keep -PRON- quiet and -PRON- carry -PRON- bodily up the step 
just at the top -PRON- recover have another fit and fight -PRON- with the ferocity of a wild beast 
as fast as -PRON- get an ami or a leg at liberty -PRON- clung to the doorway like a limpet 
and all the time -PRON- wrestle with -PRON- the ring of green fire grow hotter the flame high 
at last -PRON- force -PRON- in and whilst dandy and i hold -PRON- down mark close the airtight double door 
tt be like shut -PRON- in an oven 
-PRON- canot delay -PRON- start very long say mark mop -PRON- brow or -PRON- shall be cook alive 
all the same -PRON- canot start just yet 
why not -PRON- ask 
because -PRON- must wait for sunrise 
suppose -PRON- start in the dark -PRON- should be go right away from home fly out into the awful void of outer space beyond the orbit of jupiter 
no -PRON- must wait till the sun come up 
if -PRON- glass window can stand the heat without crack say whew 
if -PRON- can stand -PRON- 
dandy -PRON- brown skin glisten with perspiration keep a tight lip 
professor norden still in the grip of fear go on groaning 
mark study -PRON- register 
-PRON- announce that -PRON- have enough air in the cylinder for the long trip no more no margin for much delay 
the shell grow hotter more stifling 
the window be square of leap and flicker green radiance 
the padding of the inner wall be uncomfortably warm to the touch 
i begin to feel dizzy sickly limp as a boil rag 
-PRON- wonot bcr dawn for twenty minute say mark consult -PRON- watch 
the metal of the shell must be nearly redhot now 
-PRON- will be a race against time a race between the rise temperature and the rise sun 
before the shell reach white heat -PRON- must go at any risk 
be ready 
the horror of that next twenty minute will remain in -PRON- memory as long as i live 
often on hot summer night i wake up bathe in perspiration cry out to mark to let -PRON- go 
to the subdued murmur of the encircle fire be now suddenly add a few faint fresh sound and now and then mingle with the leaping green glare come stray flash of blue light 
-PRON- know what that mean 
the fire have be see in the city and the queen have send to -PRON- assistance 
-PRON- attacker be -PRON- be attack 
but i be afraid -PRON- be too late say mark 
-PRON- shall not be able to stay much long 
if the thermometer rise ten more degree i shall cut off the gravitation of jupiter and then -PRON- may be goodbye to the giant planet forever 
ten degree groan dandy 
already i cook be 
i be too far go to utter a word 
-PRON- wait lie about in helpless misery 
only mark uphold by -PRON- clear brain and strong will keep on -PRON- foot 
-PRON- hand rest on the fateful little lever that would hurl the star shell into the black abyss between the world -PRON- have eye only for the thermometer and the wateh on the table before -PRON- 
the sun be rise -PRON- cry at last 
-PRON- canot see -PRON- for the heavy cloud but i know -PRON- there 
a little longer so that -PRON- may get high in the sky and then -PRON- be off 
seven degree 
i have no sensation save for a fieree craving for a breath of cool fresh air 
nine degree say mark warningly 
at that moment with a wild yell professor norden spring to -PRON- foot and rush to the door throw -PRON- weight on the opening lever 
air 
air -PRON- shout 
let -PRON- have air 
hold -PRON- -PRON- two cry mark 
keep -PRON- fast 
-PRON- be off 
-PRON- be wonderful how -PRON- can find strength and activity in a crisis 
-PRON- collar norden and hang on to -PRON- like leech 
-PRON- fight with the ferocity of a wildcat but after a terrible two minute -PRON- pull -PRON- away from the door and get -PRON- down 
then -PRON- tie -PRON- hand and foot 
and as -PRON- get up pant exhausted mark push over the starting lever 
once more owing to professor norden the star shell be shoot into space at an unchosen moment 
an extra blast of heat grill up a roar of sound engulf -PRON- -PRON- seem press into the floor by ton of weight and then in a deathly silence a silence as sudden as the outbreak of the tempest of sound -PRON- all faint clean away 
the star shell have leave jupiter have pass through that heavy atmosphere be out in the vacancy of space be shoot with a velocity unthinkable sunward and earthward 
but would -PRON- journey end be the fiery cauldron of the glow sun or the dear familiar planet of -PRON- birth thoroughly bruise sha ken and tremble stiff and sore all over -PRON- come to -PRON- sense one by one the star shell be million of mile away from jupiter 
the vast globe of the skv be deepblack crust with the manycolore star and circle with the shine band of the milky way 
below -PRON- shone jupiter already dwindle in size and above -PRON- glow the sun glare unshadedly across the terrible void 
mark consult -PRON- indicator shake -PRON- head 
when i cut off the gravitation of jupiter -PRON- say the etheric pull drive -PRON- away from the planet 
now -PRON- arc go in -PRON- direction the attraction of the sun -PRON- be increase -PRON- velocity 
the pointer on the dial be again invisible 
how many million mile an hour -PRON- be go i can not even guess 
seem to -PRON- -PRON- will have to slip in the reverse clutch then i venture 
put on pull again and try to slow down before -PRON- overshoot -PRON- mark 
i don t want to explore the sun 
i have see quite enough of the solar system to satisfy -PRON- curiosity for a long time have already do that harry and yet -PRON- get such a fly start that the speed doesnot seem to be check at all 
-PRON- must be halfway across the zone of the asteroid already and -PRON- have well pray -PRON- donot hit one 
and there s mar to westward and there s the earth and -PRON- moon 
one thing i be pleased with -PRON- be head more nearly straight for home than i dare to expect 
then nothing be there that -PRON- can do but wait ask prince danda singh 
nothing 
later i shall be able to tell -PRON- more definitely what -PRON- chance be 
better let norden loose now -PRON- wonot be likely to do any more harm 
-PRON- untie the treacherous professor and help -PRON- to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- be white with fear and the first symptom of spacesickness be grip -PRON- 
-PRON- smile weakly sorry gentleman -PRON- say be a very poor sort of friend but i beg -PRON- to believe that i be sorry 
i must have be mad 
let bygone be bygone 
-PRON- shall trust -PRON- as far as -PRON- can see -PRON- and not an inch farther norden say when -PRON- get back if ever -PRON- get back there must be a reckoning with -PRON- 
and then the pang and nausea of spacesickness claim -PRON- all for awhile and -PRON- forget everything else in the deadly agony of that indescribable malady 
when hour later -PRON- pass and -PRON- begin to recover -PRON- have reach the orbit of mar 
the needle be show as a quiver blur on the indicator dial 
another nine or ten hour at gradually lessen speed should see -PRON- somewhere near the earth and -PRON- fate would be decide 
now that -PRON- be near home -PRON- thought go back rather longingly rather regretfully to the giant planet -PRON- have be oblige to leave so suddenly 
in spite of -PRON- hairraising experience there i feel a sense of loss a twinge of sorrow at departure 
i should have like to see more of that wonderful world of vast continent and silvery sea of dense cloud and terrific storm 
i find now that i have leave -PRON- that i have grow to like -PRON- civilized people -PRON- gentleness -PRON- good nature -PRON- marvelous science 
i want to know how the long fight between -PRON- and the barbarian would go on in the year to come 
above all i want to see the city nadir again to look on -PRON- forest of tapering spire -PRON- smooth road busy with traffic -PRON- gay garden gorgeous with flower and bloom sweet with scent and musical with the song of fearless bird 
-PRON- be some slight satisfaction indeed to remember that -PRON- have be helpful in the war that -PRON- have rescue queen brisei from the hand of megalof and that the battle of the isthmus have be fight and win 
if -PRON- reach the earth safely i say to -PRON- -PRON- would almost be worth while try to make the great journey again 
almost 
at last come the critical moment 
-PRON- gather round mark who have -PRON- hand on the control lever 
-PRON- have to check -PRON- speed by cut off and put on in turn the attraction of the earth and moon and sun and so endeavor to bring the shell into the atmosphere at the right angle think -PRON- shall do -PRON- but -PRON- will be touch and go with -PRON- say mark have -PRON- down to a few thousand mile an hour and i hope to dive into the air in the same direction as the rotation of the earth 
that will lessen the jar for -PRON- as a fielder -PRON- know in catch a fast one let -PRON- hand travel the same way as the ball 
where shall -PRON- land ask norden strangely meek 
impossible to say reply mark 
-PRON- be approach the night side of the hold on all of -PRON- 
a few more minute will settle everything for -PRON- 
-PRON- be drop fast 
no yes the speed be fall 
hurrah 
-PRON- be home 
the star shell plunge into the atmosphere as -PRON- speak 
the scream of -PRON- passage nearly deafen -PRON- the heat cause by the swift friction give -PRON- another turkish bath 
but the resistance of the air quickly reduce -PRON- speed and -PRON- be quite gently that -PRON- drop into the sea 
-PRON- know -PRON- have fall into the sea for -PRON- progress be suddenly stop and a froth of boiling water heat by the glowing metal wall of the shell hiss all around -PRON- 
then -PRON- go up again on the rebound and after a few more plunge the great projectile lie roll on the surface aimlessly as a float cork 
seize in the grip of some strong force -PRON- be carry forward turn over and over ground raspingly be lift again and leave motionless at last above low water mark 
a constant noise like the regular booming of heavy gun fill -PRON- ear 
the door happen to be uppermost 
-PRON- fling -PRON- open eagerly and crawl out upon the top of the shell 
one glance tell -PRON- where -PRON- have hit the homeward trail 
tim shell lie on the coral shore of a tiny atoll 
the sound -PRON- hear be the roar of the surf on the bar 
-PRON- have fall on a pacific island say mark 
uninhabite apparently 
i shall have to take -PRON- bearing and see if -PRON- be anywhere near a regular steamer route 
the island be in shape like a break hoop 
-PRON- be a ring of coral rock interrupt in one place only a curve of coral and yellow sand fringe with palm 
here and there thicken out -PRON- bear cluster of tropical tree 
on the bar where the ring be break the surf boil and roar and all along the outer edge of the reef the heavy pacific swell boom and crash incessantly 
within the reef lie the lagoon a blue lake of still water calm as a pond 
-PRON- be a picture an artist dream 
may have be a bad place for landing say -PRON- have do fine mark 
-PRON- may have drop -PRON- in the middle of africa or at the north pole 
-PRON- will do -PRON- good to have a lazy holiday here 
mark didnot seem very enthusiastic 
-PRON- look pretty enough harry but -PRON- may be hundred of mile out of the beat track 
-PRON- may not see a ship for month year 
and -PRON- have to see if there be a spring on the island or whether the vegetation depend on the rain 
-PRON- make the circuit of the atoll from the gap in the reef to the other side of -PRON- and back again 
-PRON- find coconut palm and a few stunted breadfruit tree but not a trace of water 
not even a drop of moisture lie in the hollow of the coral rock above high tide 
take -PRON- position as well as -PRON- could with the instrument in -PRON- possession mark announce that -PRON- fear -PRON- be at least a hundred mile from any regular steamer route 
snake and tiger say the middle of africa would have be well after all 
this be about as bad a fix as -PRON- have be in yet 
maroon on a solitary atoll without a boat and with nothing to drink when -PRON- have finish -PRON- supply of ater from jupiter wish i have never see -PRON- nor -PRON- accursed invention cry norden 
nobody ask -PRON- to join -PRON- professor say mark in a chilly tone 
go away and grouch by -PRON- if -PRON- want to keep out of trouble 
although the outlook be black enough -PRON- three after what -PRON- have go through be not easily depressed 
-PRON- be indeed rather difficult stand on that treefringe curve of rock and sand between the thunder of the surf and the calm of the lagoon bathe in sunshine under a sky of flawless blue to give way to complete despair 
but when three day pass without a drop of rain without a sail break the monotony of the great circle of the sea and -PRON- water supply be nearly go the charm ofthe lovely isle begin to fade 
to keep -PRON- mind busy -PRON- talk over -PRON- plan in case -PRON- be rescue 
-PRON- know -PRON- would be extremely difficult to convince the world of the truth of -PRON- story but -PRON- think that if -PRON- could get the star shell safely home and mark could produce -PRON- calculation and formula before competent scientific man -PRON- may be believe in time 
much depend upon those precious document and on the ovian photograph and curio that be snugly store in the shell be shortly after daybreak on the a fourth day as -PRON- three be stand on the high point of the reef norden have wander away by -PRON- that the end come ship cry dandy huskily small ship full of sail 
here come follow the direction of -PRON- pointing finger -PRON- see a sehooner bear down upon the island -PRON- sail silhouette upon the rosy glow of the dawn 
-PRON- shake each other hand dance croak -PRON- throat be too dry to shout and wave -PRON- hat in the abandon of relief 
-PRON- be save good hick hold out right to the end say mark shall evidently have to die in -PRON- bed of old age no matter what happen 
hullo norden do 
the professor have evidently see the ship before -PRON- have for -PRON- be already on the shore run and nearly at the shell 
-PRON- do not move for -PRON- be too far away to stop -PRON- whatever mischief -PRON- may be plan 
long before -PRON- could reach -PRON- -PRON- would be safely inside -PRON- precious vehicle treacherous hound mean to leave -PRON- to steal the shell to make a journey on -PRON- own account say -PRON- will be suicide for -PRON- can not work the vessel -PRON- nor be -PRON- provision now 
utterly helpless -PRON- stand and watch the last act in the lifedrama of the wonderful star shell 
norden reach -PRON- climb up and stand in the open doorway for a moment hold out a round black object at arm length for -PRON- to see 
the faint sound of -PRON- husky voice -PRON- cackling laughter come to -PRON- on the sea breeze mingle with the thunder of the surf 
the climax be sudden unexpected 
norden appear to stumble try to recover -PRON- footing lurch backward and disappear into the shell 
instantly a blaze of light burst out vivid even in the sunshine a cloud of smoke arise and a bang of fierce explosive sound shake the air 
then the gale blow the cloud away and where the shell have lie be merely a great hole in the sand be a jovian bomb say remember that one be miss in the great battle 
norden must have steal -PRON- 
what -PRON- intend to do -PRON- shall never know now 
perhaps -PRON- be go to blow -PRON- all up with -PRON- later 
anyhow -PRON- have only do -PRON- in praise be 
only ask mark 
oh the star shell 
-PRON- can build another one old fellow 
with all -PRON- paper and formula the result of year of work blow to fragment 
with all the proof of -PRON- voyage destroy afraid harry that -PRON- first trip to the star be also -PRON- last 
a boat be now put off from the schooner 
and what shall -PRON- say to these people 
how shall -PRON- explain the explosion and -PRON- presence here ust tell -PRON- the truth harry say mark wearily 
-PRON- will want to know what ship -PRON- have be wreck in -PRON- will be firmly convince that what -PRON- see be the detonation of a float mine 
but tell -PRON- the truth -PRON- wonot believe -PRON- 
and -PRON- didnot nor do the world 
but -PRON- three know 
mark be work hard again and some day perhaps perhaps 
no 
the lady of the velvet collar by a stormy night in the tempestuous time of the french revolution a young german be return to -PRON- lodging at a late hour across the old part of paris 
the lightning gleam and the loud clap of thunder rattle through the lofty narrow street but i should first tell -PRON- something about this young german 
gottfrie wolfgang be a young man of good family 
-PRON- have study for some time at gottingen but being of a visionary and enthusiastic character -PRON- have wander into those wild and speculative doctrine which have so often bewilder german student

-PRON- health be impair -PRON- imagination disease 
-PRON- have be indulge in fanciful speculation on spiritual essence until like swedenborg -PRON- have an ideal world of -PRON- own around -PRON- 
-PRON- take up a notion i do not know from what cause that there be an evil influence hang over -PRON- an evil genius or spirit seek to ensnare -PRON- and insure -PRON- perdition 
such an idea work on -PRON- melancholy temperament produce the most gloomy effect 
-PRON- become haggard and desponding 
-PRON- friend discover the mental malady preying upon -PRON- and determine that the good cure be a change of scene -PRON- be send therefore to finish -PRON- study amidst the splendor and gayetie of paris 
wolfgang arrive at paris at the breaking out of the revolution 
the popular delirium at first catch -PRON- enthusiastic mind and -PRON- be captivate by the political and philosophical theory of the day but the scene of blood which follow shock -PRON- sensitive nature disgust -PRON- with society and the world and make -PRON- more than ever a recluse 
-PRON- shut -PRON- up in a solitary apartment in the pay latin the quarter of student 
there in a gloomy street not far from the monastic wall of the sorbonne -PRON- pursue -PRON- favorite speculation 
sometimes -PRON- spend hour together in the great library of pari those catacomb of departed author rummage among -PRON- hoard of dusty and obsolete work in quest of food for -PRON- unhealthy appetite 
-PRON- be in a manner a literary ghoul feeding in the charnelhouse of decay literature 
wolfgang though solitary and refuse be of an ardent temperament nit for a time -PRON- operate merely upon -PRON- imagination 
-PRON- be too shy and ignorant of the world to nake any advance to the fair but -PRON- be a passionate admirer of female oeauty and in -PRON- lonely chamber would often lose -PRON- in reverie on form and face which -PRON- have see -PRON- fancy would deck out image of loveliness far surpass the eality 
while -PRON- mind be in this excited and sublimated state a dream produce an extraordinary effect upon aim 
-PRON- be of a female face of traneendent beauty 
so strong be the mpression make that -PRON- dream of again and again 
-PRON- haunt -PRON- hought by day -PRON- slumber by light in fine -PRON- become passionately namored of this shadow of a dream 
this last so long that -PRON- become one of those fix idea which haunt the mind of melancholy man and be at ime mistake for madness 
such be gottfrie wolfgang and ueh -PRON- situation at the time i mention 
-PRON- be return home late one stormy night through some of the old and gloomy street of the marais the ancient part of paris 
the loud clap of thunder rattle among the high house of the narrow street 
-PRON- come to the place de la greve the square where public execution be perform 
the lightning quiver about the pinnacle of the ancient hotel de ville and shed flicker gleam over the open space in front 
as wolfgang be cross the square -PRON- shrink back with horror at find -PRON- close by the guillotine 
-PRON- be the height of the reign of terror when this dreadful instrument of death stand ever ready and -PRON- scaffold be continually run with the blood of the virtuous and the brave 
-PRON- have that very day be actively employ in the work of carnage and there -PRON- stand in gium array amidst a silent and sleep city wait for fresh victim heart sicken within -PRON- and -PRON- be turn shudder from the horrible engine when -PRON- behold a shadowy form cowering as -PRON- be at the foot of the step which lead up to the scaffold 
a succession of vivid flash of lightning reveal -PRON- more distinctly 
-PRON- be a female figure dress in black 
-PRON- be seat on one of the low step of the scaffold lean forward -PRON- face hide in -PRON- lap and -PRON- long disheveled tress hang to the ground stream with the rain which fall in torrent 
wolfgang paused 
there be something awful in this solitary monument of wo 
the female have the appearance of be above the common order 
-PRON- know the time to be full of vicissitude and that many a fair head which have once be pillow on down now wander houseless 
perhaps this be some poor mourner whom the dreadful ax have render desolate and who sit here heartbroken on the strand of existence from which all that be dear to -PRON- have be launch into eternity 
-PRON- approach and address -PRON- in the accent of sympathy 
-PRON- raise -PRON- head and gaze wildly at -PRON- 
what be -PRON- astonishment at behold by the bright glare of the lightning the very face which have haunt -PRON- in -PRON- dream 
-PRON- be pale and disconsolate but ravishingly beautiful 
tremble with violent and conflicting emotion wolfgang again accost -PRON- 
-PRON- speak something of -PRON- be expose at such an hour of the night and to the fury of such a storm and offer to conduct -PRON- to -PRON- friend 
-PRON- point to the guillotine with a gesture of dreadful signification have no friend on earth say -PRON- 
but -PRON- have a home say wolfgang 
yes in the grave 
the heart of the student melt at the word 
if a stranger dare make an offer say -PRON- without danger of be misunderstood i would offer -PRON- humble dwelling as a shelter -PRON- as a devoted friend 
i be friendless -PRON- in paris and a stranger in the land but if -PRON- life could be of service -PRON- be at -PRON- disposal and should be sacrifice before harm or indignity should come to -PRON- 
there be an honest earnestness in the young man manner that have -PRON- effect 
-PRON- foreign accent too be in -PRON- favor -PRON- show -PRON- not to be a hackneye inhabitant of paris 
indeed there be an eloquence in true enthusiasm that be not to be doubt 
the homeless stranger confide -PRON- implieity to the protection of the student 
-PRON- support -PRON- faltering step across the pont neuf and by the place where the statue of henry the fourth have be overthrow by the populace 
the storm have abate and the thunder rumble at a distance 
all paris be quiet that great volcano of human passion slumber for awhile to gather fresh strength for the next day eruption 
the student conduct -PRON- charge through the ancient street of the pay latin and by the dusky wall of the sorbonne to the great dingy hotel which -PRON- inhabit 
the old portress who admit -PRON- stare with surprize at the unusual sight of the melancholy wolfgang with a female companion 
on enter -PRON- apartment the student for the first time blush at the scantiness and indifference of -PRON- dwelling 
-PRON- have but one chamber an oldfashione salon heavily carve and fantastically furnished with the remain of former magnificence for -PRON- be of those hotel in the quarter of the luxembourg palace which have once belong to nobility 
-PRON- be lumber with book and paper and all the usual apparatus of a student and -PRON- bed stand in a recess at one end 
when light be bring and wolfgang have a well opportunity of contemplate the stranger lie be more than ever intoxicate by -PRON- beauty 
-PRON- face be pale but of a dazzle fairness set off by a profusion of raven hair that hang cluster about -PRON- 
-PRON- eye be large and brilliant with a singular expression approach almost to wildness 
as far as -PRON- black dress permit -PRON- shape to be see -PRON- be of perfect symmetry 
-PRON- whole appearance be highly striking though -PRON- be dress in the simple style 
the only thing approach to an ornament which -PRON- wear be a broad black band round -PRON- neck clasp by diamond 
the perplexity now commence with the student how to dispose of the helpless be thus throw upon -PRON- protection 
-PRON- think of abandon -PRON- chamber to -PRON- and seek shelter for -PRON- elsewhere 
still -PRON- be so fascinate by -PRON- charm there seem to be such a spell upon -PRON- thought and wense that -PRON- could not tear -PRON- from -PRON- presence 
-PRON- manner too be singular and unaccountable 
-PRON- speak no more of the guillotine 
-PRON- grief have abate 
the attention of the student have first avon -PRON- confidence and then apparently -PRON- heart 
-PRON- be evidently an enthusiast like -PRON- and enthusiast soon understand each other 
in the infatuation of the moment wolfgang avow -PRON- passion for -PRON- 
-PRON- tell -PRON- the story of -PRON- mysterious dream and how -PRON- have possess -PRON- heart before -PRON- have even see -PRON- 
-PRON- be strangely affect by -PRON- recital and acknowledge to have feel an impulse toward -PRON- equally unaccountable 
-PRON- be the time for wild theory and wild action 
old prejudice and superstition be do away everything be under the sway of the goddess of reason 
among other rubbish of the old time the form and ceremony of marriage begin to be consider superfluous bond for honorable mind 
social compact wer the vogue 
wolfgang be too much of a theorist not to be taint by the liberal doctrine of the day 
why should -PRON- separate say -PRON- 
-PRON- heart be unite in the eye of reason and honor -PRON- be as one 
what need be there of sordid form to bind high soul together 
the stranger listen with emotion -PRON- have evidently receive illumination at the same school 
-PRON- have no home nor family continue -PRON- let -PRON- be everything to -PRON- or rather let -PRON- be everything to one another 
if form be necessary form shall be observe there be -PRON- hand 
i pledge -PRON- to -PRON- forever 
forever say the stranger solemnly 
forever repeat wolfgang 
the stranger clasp the hand extend to -PRON- then i be -PRON- murmured -PRON- and sink upon -PRON- bosom -PRON- next morning the student leave -PRON- bride sleeping and sally forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartment suitable to the change in -PRON- situation 
when -PRON- return -PRON- find the stranger lie with -PRON- head hang over the bed and one arm throw over -PRON- 
-PRON- speak to -PRON- but receive no reply 
-PRON- advance to awaken -PRON- from -PRON- uneasy posture 
on take -PRON- hand -PRON- be cold there be no pulsation -PRON- face be pallid and ghastly in a word -PRON- be a corpse 
horrified and frantic -PRON- alarm the house 
a scene of confusion ensue 
the police be summon 
as the officer of police enter the room -PRON- start back on behold the coipse 
great heaven cry -PRON- how do this woman come here 
do -PRON- know anything about -PRON- say wolfgang eagerly 
do exclaim the police officer -PRON- be guillotine yesterday 
-PRON- step forward undid the black collar round the neck of the corpse and the head roll on the floor 
the student burst into a frenzy 
the fiend the fiend have gain possession of -PRON- shriek -PRON- be lose forever 
-PRON- try to soothe -PRON- but in vain 
-PRON- be possess with the frightful belief that an evil spirit have reanimate the dead body to ensnare -PRON- 
-PRON- go distracted and die in a madhouse time to time in letter to the eyrie reader have affirm that -PRON- be impossible for hair to turn white overnight from a sudden dreadful shock that there be no nerve in the hairfollicle and therefore a sudden fright can turn hair white only at the root 
the nerve touch the hairroot say these reader can cause the hair to turn white at the base and grow out white but the hair that be already grow out canot possibly turn white 
however the belief that hair can turn white from a sudden shock be so universal that -PRON- ask dr evan wellknown writer on medical subject and former chicago health commissioner to settle the question for -PRON- reader bear in mind line in the prisoner of chillon -PRON- hair be gray but hot with year nor turn -PRON- white in a single night as men have grow from sudden fear 
dr evan quote from the care of the skin and hair 
page grayness be often influence by emotional and other mental trial particularly those that be prolong and -PRON- be not an uncommon occurrence to see -PRON- develop rapidly from grief severe business anxiety or other condition of intense mental strain 
that grayness sometimes occur suddenly be a general impression which i believe be correct 
-PRON- be difficult to understand the mechanism of -PRON- sudden production but some of the most unromantic and reliable scientific obseiver have record case of -PRON- 
that seem to settle the case in favor of those writer of weird story who let -PRON- hair turn white overnight as men have grow from sudden fear pusey say dr evan be an authority

detective sergeant costello ask respectfully lean forward from the rear seat of the car 
wait wait -PRON- friend de grandin reply with a smile 
when -PRON- duty be all perform i shall tell -PRON- such a tale as shall make -PRON- two eye to pop outward like a snail 
first however -PRON- must go with -PRON- to restore this jpauvre enfant 1o -PRON- mother arm then to the headquarters to report the death of that sale bete 
friend trowbridge will stay with the young lady for so long as -PRON- deem necessary and i shall remain with -PRON- to help 
then this evening with -PRON- consent friend trow bridge -PRON- will dine with -PRON- sergent and i shall tell -PRON- all everything in total 
death of -PRON- iife what a tale -PRON- be 
parbleu but -PRON- shall call -PRON- a liar many time before -PRON- be finish ule de grandin place -PRON- demitasse on the tabouret and refill -PRON- liqueur glass 
-PRON- friend -PRON- begin turn -PRON- quick elfish smile first on costello then on -PRON- have promise -PRON- a remarkable tale 
very well then to begin 
-PRON- flick a wholly imaginary fleck of dust from -PRON- dinner jacket sleeve and cross -PRON- slender womanishly ana foot on the hearth rug 
do -PRON- recall friend trowbridge how -PRON- go -PRON- and to -PRON- tea give by the good madame norman 
yes 
perhaps then -PRON- will recall how at the entrance of the ballroom i stop with a look of as1 onishment on -PRON- face 
very good 
at that moment i see that which make -PRON- disbelieve the evidence of -PRON- own two eye 
as the gentleman -PRON- later meet as count czerny dance past a mirror on the wall i behold parbleu what do -PRON- suppose the reflection only of -PRON- dancing partner 
-PRON- be as if the man have be nonexistent and the young lady have dance past the mirror by heiself 
now such a thing be not likely i admit -PRON- sergent and -PRON- too friend trowbridge will say -PRON- be not possible but such be not the case 
in certain circumstance -PRON- be possible for that which -PRON- see with -PRON- eye to cast no shadow in a mirror 
let that point wait a moment -PRON- have other evidence to consider first 
when the young man tell -PRON- of the count prowess in battle of -PRON- imcomparable ferocity i begin to believe that which i have at first disbelieve and when -PRON- tell -PRON- the count be a hungarian i begin to believe more than ever meet the count as -PRON- will remember and i take -PRON- hand in mine 
parbleu -PRON- be like a hand with no palm -PRON- have hair on both side of -PRON- 
-PRON- too friend trowbridge remark on that phenomenon 
while i talk with -PRON- i manage to maneuver -PRON- before a mirror 
morbleu the man be as if -PRON- have not be i could see -PRON- own face smile at -PRON- where i know i should have see the reflection of -PRON- shoulder now attend -PRON- the surete general what -PRON- call the police headquarters of paris be not like -PRON- english and american bureaus 
all fact no matter however seemingly absurd which come to that office be carefully note down for future reference 
among other history i have read in the archive of that office be that of one baron lajo czuczron of transylvania whose action have once be watch by -PRON- secret agent 
this man be rich and favor beyond the common run of hungarian petty noble but -PRON- be far from beloved by -PRON- peasantry 
-PRON- be know as cruel wicked and implacable and no one could be find who have ever one kind word to say for -PRON- 
half the countryside suspect -PRON- of be a loupgarou or werewolf the other credit a local legend that a woman of -PRON- family have once in the olden day take a demon to husband and that -PRON- be the offspring of that unholy union 
accord to the story the progeny of this wicked woman live like an ordinary man for one hundred year then die on the stroke of the century unless -PRON- vitality tea renew by drink the blood of a slaughter virgin 
absurd 
possibly 
an english intelligence office would have say bally nonsense if one of -PRON- agent have send in such a report 
an american bureau would have label the report as be the saueeoftheapple but consider this fact in six hundred year there be no single record of a baron czuczron have die 
baron grow old old to the point of death but always there come along a new baron a man in the prime of life not a youth to take the old baron place nor could any say when the old baron have die or where -PRON- body have be lay 
now i have be tell that a man under a curse the werewolf the vampire or any other thing in man shape who live more than -PRON- allot time by virtue of wickedness can not cast a shadow in a mirror also that those accurse one have hair in the palm of -PRON- hand 
eh bien with this foreknowledge i engage this man who call -PRON- count czerny in conversation concern transylvania 
parbleu the fellow deny all knowledge of the country 
-PRON- deny -PRON- with more force than be necessary 
-PRON- be a liar monsieur le comte i tell -PRON- but i say -PRON- to -PRON- 
even yet however i do not think what i think later 
then come the case of the young eckhart 
-PRON- lose blood -PRON- can not say how or why but friend trowbridge and i find a queer mark on -PRON- body 
i think to -PRON- if perhaps a vampire a member of that accurse tribe who leave -PRON- grave by night and suck the blood of the living be here that would account for this young man condition 
but where would such a being come from -PRON- be not likely 
then i meet that old man the one -PRON- call indian john 
-PRON- tell -PRON- much of the history of this town in the early day and -PRON- tell -PRON- something more 
-PRON- tell of a man an old old man who have pay -PRON- much money to go to a certain grave the grave of a repute witch in the old cemetery and dig from about -PRON- a growth of wild garlic 
garlic i know be a plant intolerable to the vampire 
-PRON- can not abide -PRON- 
if -PRON- be plant on -PRON- grave -PRON- can not pass -PRON- ask -PRON- who would want such a thing to be and why 
but i have no answer only i know if a vampire have be confine to that grave by plant garlic then liberate when that garlic be take away -PRON- would account for the young eckhart s strange sickness 
tien friend trowbridge and i visit that grave and on -PRON- tombstone -PRON- read a verse which make -PRON- believe the tenant of that grave may be a vampire 
-PRON- interview the good minister of the church and learn that another man an old old man have also inquire about that strange grave 
who have do this 
i ask -PRON- but even yet i have no definite answer to -PRON- question 
as -PRON- rush to the norman house to see young eckhart i stop at an next month the city of glass by masterpiece of weird fiction a tale of atlantis of incredibly age human being who have build -PRON- city of glass in the african desert a complete novelette of uncanny thrill and terrify adventure a weirdscientific story of titanic mushroom and giant toadstool of explode fungus and deathdeale spore

parbleu some man an old old man have what -PRON- american call corner the available supply of garlic 
cordieu i tell -PRON- this old man -PRON- constantly cross -PRON- trail 
also -PRON- be a very great nuisance 
the italian tell -PRON- the garlic be send to a house in rupleysville so i have an idea where this interfere old rascal may abide 
but at that moment i have great need to see -PRON- friend eckhart than to ask further question of the italian 
before i go however i tell that shopkeeper that -PRON- garlic customer have the evil eye 
parbleu monsieur garlicbuyer -PRON- will have no more dealing with that italian 
-PRON- know what -PRON- know 
when -PRON- arrive at the norman house -PRON- find young eckhart in great trouble and a black serve maid tell of a strangelooke woman who bite -PRON- 
also -PRON- find toothmark on -PRON- breast 
the vampirewoman sarah be in very truth at large i tell -PRON- and so i hasten to the cemetery to make -PRON- fast to -PRON- grave with a wooden stake for once -PRON- be stake down the vampire can no longer roam 
-PRON- be finish 
friend trowbridge will testify -PRON- see blood on the stake drive into a drave dig nearly three hundred year ago be -PRON- not so mon ami i nod assent and -PRON- take up -PRON- narrative why this old man should wish to liberate the vampirewoman i know not certain -PRON- be one of that grisly guild or one closely associate with -PRON- as this count czerny undoubtedly be can tell when another of the company be in the vicinity and i doubt not -PRON- do this deed for pure malice and deviltry 
however that may be friend trowbridge tell -PRON- -PRON- have see the count and that -PRON- seem to have age greatly 
the man who visit the clergyman and the man who buy the garlic be also much old than the count as -PRON- know -PRON- 
ah ha -PRON- be come to the end of -PRON- century i tell -PRON- now look out for devilment jule de grandin 
certainly -PRON- be sure to come 
and then -PRON- sergent come -PRON- with -PRON- tale of mademoiselle disappearance and too think perhaps -PRON- have run away from home voluntarily of -PRON- own free will until -PRON- say the italian shopkeeper recognize the old man who accost -PRON- as one who have the evil eye 
now what old man save the one who buy the garlic and who live at rupleysville would that italian accuse of the evil eye 
pardieu have -PRON- not already tell -PRON- the same man once buy -PRON- garlic 
but yes 
the case be complete 
the girl have disappear an old old man have accost -PRON- an old old man who be so strong -PRON- could overcome a policeman the count be near -PRON- century mark when -PRON- must die like other man unless -PRON- can secure the blood of a virgin to revivify -PRON- 
i be more than certain that the count and baron be one and the same and that -PRON- both dwell at rupleysville 
voila -PRON- go to rupleysville and -PRON- arrive there not one little minute too soon mes amis sure costello agree rise and hold out -PRON- hand in farewell get th good doc
