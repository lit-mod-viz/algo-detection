by accountancy vve do not mean bookkeeping
for accountancy begins where bookkeeping leaves the skilled accountant takes the figures handed him by the bookkeeper and analyzes and interprets them
he knows how much the costs in the various departments should amount to how they may be lowered
he knows what profits should be expected from a given enterprise how they may be increased
he knows in a given business what per cent of ones working capital can safely be tied up in merchandise on hand what per cent is safe and adequate for sales promotion
and these by the way are but two of scores of percentagefigures wherewith he points the way to successful operation
he knows the intricacies of government taxation
he knows how to survey the transactions of a business over a given mriod how to show in cold hard figures the progress it has made and where it is going
he knows how to use these findings as a basis for constructive policies
in short the trained accountant is the controlling engineer of business one man business cannot do without
small wonder that he commands a salary two to ten times as great as that of the bookkeeper
indeed as an independent operator head of his own accounting firm he may earn as much as the president of the big and influential bank in his community or the operating manager of a great railroad

a woman bookkeeper buried in details of a small job is now auditor of an apartment hotel and her salary mounted in proportion to her work
a credit manager earning a month moved up quickly to to and then to a highly profitable accounting business of his own which nets him better than a year

we read an interplanetary novelette are fascinated by some of the stimulating ideas contained therein then sit back and admire the writers ingenuity
that a vast percentage of the readers of are vitally concerned regarding the origins backgrounds and themes of the stories they read has already been demonstrated conclusively by their numerous letters of approbation since the inception of this department an absorbing game going behind the scenes looking right over the authors shoulder at the halfstarted page in his typewriter
but heres a word of warning anesthetize the effect of the stories by consulting the following letters prior to reading the works they tel about
in several letters the authors tip their hands and what is intended to be a surprise in the story is frankly discussed
so turn back here only after youve read the entire issue by is a mighty interesting story from its dramatic start to the surprising climax how mr binder explains the genesis of his novelette the idea behind was one of those that strike suddenly
i had been vacuously casting about for a good plot but wanted to get away from the usual themes
how about something really appalling in the way of earthly dooms but at the same time something close to the ground
it may have been my subconscious grilling that suddenly gave life to the idea of the sun falling down on earth there was a menace or a terror that was personal one that each reader would feel menaced him
from there it was a natural step to split the story into separate episodes to indicate how universal how far reaching the doom was
it was a human interest theme and as such had to be developed from the angle of human emotion rather than action
the jungle scene suggested itself immediately for what can shake a mans guilt out of his secret soul quicker than the knowledge of doom and judgment
and so with the other scenes
each was the choice out of dozens or hundreds of similar episodes that might he occurring anywhere on earth during those tumultuous hours
the science of the story is frankly subordinate to the human interest
it called for no more stretch of imagination than the usual doom story but had to be plausible for the sake of realism
for that reason the etherstrain explanation had to be complete but sketchy in order to take up as little space as possible have always been of the opinion right or wrong that science fiction needs much more of human interest
with the influence that the late weinbaum exercised on sciencefiction i am glad to note a definite trend toward the humanizing of its once so cold and lifeless characters
we need scientists that are not wooden puppets villains that are humanly yet viciously motivated heroes that go more by the heart than by the mind and menaces that hit us between the eyes do not mean that we should stop exploring the immeasurable reaches of space or halt the progress of superscience or limit the boundless delving of imagination in our stories but i do believe we at the other side of the editorial desk should not hesitate to have our characters act in accordance with human nature
too often our hero follows a psychology path laid out by a framework of science and fails to be fundamentally human
at any rate the story of attempts to show the probable reaction of humanity to the panic of worlds end as characterized by a few chosen examples of ifs collective hordes
if it creates in the reader the slightest thrill of personal danger it has hit its mark
otherwise it has missed it completely and ingloriously novelette is a plausible account of what might happen in a future war between forces depending mainly on scientific weapons for supremacy what mr zagat has to say regarding the development of his story the pattern of life does not change though the environment perhaps even the form of man undergoes a constant mutation
through the ages the fundamentals of this thing we call living remain the same loyaltv and treachery selflessness and greed patriotism and treason selfseeking and selfsacrifice friendship and enmity love and hate adventure and desuetude
it was the conflict and inlerplay of these that furnished with the warp of his tales the earliest cromagnon storyweaver crouching shaggy and brutefaced in the communal cave and dispelling with the magic of his grunted monosyllabic speech the tribes shuddering dread of the sabretooth tiger whose roar beat out of the fearful dark against the portal boulder
they composed the lay of the silkribboned troubadour strumming his lyre in the castles highraftered hall while armored sentries paced the battlements
they furbish the pages of printed books and vibrate through the ether on the wings of a modern miracle
tomorrow who knows by what unthoughtof medium they will reach the brains and hearts and dreams of men
but always they were and are and be unaltered
once upon a time hordes swept ravening to the conquest of a world
once alexander and khan fought for universal empire
once napoleon closed a fist knuckled with cannon upon all europe
today listen to the pound of the forge the roar of the furnace fires the hissing of chemists acids fashioning new weapons tor an old attack and tomorrow
tomorrow it will be the same as yesterday
in the near future the wouldbe conqueror may come from some race newly reborn to lust for dominance
in the dim reaches of time to come he may sweep upon terra from some distant planet from

when the fight is over won or lost some yarnspinner whose primal germ lies unguessed in your loins or mine or that of the elevator boy who just closed the gate in your anteroom will sing the saga of those newer heroes
to anticipate some narrator who lies curled in the womb of things to be to peer a little behind the veil that screens that which is to happen i wrote that adventure will not occur to be sure
but some other adventure whose human fundamentals will be just the same is as certain to occur as that in this next instant i will complete this sentence by dr the cover story for this issue carries a surprise ending that were certain few readers will anticipate how dr carr planned his interplanetary short i wanted to write a story about space piracy and a lone wolf crusader wdio for reasons knowm only to himself waged a fierce and singlehanded warfare against these buccaneers of the skies
this crusader would be a man of mystery of course his identity unknown on any planet
it would be necessary therefore to mask him for he must often come in contact with space patrolmen and others
the idea of making him a metal man governed by an organic brain seemed good
but where was i to get the human intelligence which must inhabit this brain
then i made use of an idea that i had had in mind for some time that of liberating the human intelligence by subjecting the body to an electrical wave whose frequency was the same as that of the body upon which it was directed
this too seemed good i could take the intelligence from someone who had been victimized by pirates and thus provide my crusader with his motive
the story was started and action precipitated by having the child become affected by a harmonic of the wave directed upon her father
and so it was in this manner that came to be written
a eil fascinating novelette of last stand and of first space migration was written after some considerable attention had been devoted to the theme by the author
jones did a careful job on this as youll realize from reading this explains itself
it is the conception of a dying world with humanity still persisting in spite of adversity
it is proved that planets have age that they become old and uninhabitable
their best ages of existence fade away
wells the time machine afforded me much food for thought on the subject
it is extremely doubtful that mankind will carry on for five million years or a million more years for that matter
aa a group he is ilka the jug that is carried to the well too often
there are too many things which may happen to him
yet there still remains a possibility that he may struggle onward for five million years
regarding this possibility have presented but one viewpoint of what might happen what he might be like yet there is nothing too definite on which to base this assumption
too many things can happen to change history environment and man himself evolution is guided largely by environment and his own initiative
it is scarcely to be taken for granted that the course of the worlds civilization shall be forward
there will be inevitable retrogression mankind will to all probabilities and fall change form and shape revert to degenerate savagery return again to a civilized slate
mankind is menaced with all forms of destruction including himself for man is often worst enemy
i have drawn a very conservative conception of the change wrought in man after five million years for it is to vie expected that he may assume an even more radical appearance than that suggested in the tale
man long ago lost his tail and most of the hair which entirely covered his body appendix too is due to become passe
in time with the help of science he may come to subsist entirely upon radiated energy this after having supplemented his digestive diet with more and more of the radiated energy until finally the digestive organs have become extinct
when earth grows old
man if he be sufficiently intelligent must find a new world peculiarly adapted to him
it is most likely that during the rise and fall of humanity throughout the ages space flying will be rediscovered and lost many times
there may even be visitors from beyond our own solar occasional retrogressions to savagery and animalism will probably be swifter than his forward returns evolution following the line of least resistance
that he will become the foodless and sleepless creature depicted in my story is but one of myriad possibilities for many things can happen to him in so long a time
no one can with any certainty anticipate the farflung destiny of man in the light of reasonable consideration they may only conjecture ay will always be famous for his stories of atomic exploration how the author of first conceived this theme once i was a very earnest young bunessman
i took a subway ride
i sat idly staring at the advertisements over the seats across from me
my attention focussed on an ad of the quaker oats company
it showed the portly figure of a quaker gentleman in a threecornered hat
he held in his hand a box of oats on which was a picture of the same gentleman holding a similar package
and on that package i could distinguish a still smaller quaker still holding another tiny package
i stared spellbound
i began to wonder if by going closer to the ad i would see a fourth smaller quaker
and a fifth
if i had a microscope and the printing were mathematically perfect how many could i see
an infinite numberl quaker oats down into the infinity of smallness
i went home seized pencil and paper
thus my first atomic story the girl in the golden atom was born
and it has served as inspiration for all my other science fiction
but i was blissfully ignorant
in writing my first story i violated every rule of plot construction and handling
for instance i called my hero the very young man
when the story was in proof an irritated proofreader phoned me asking for a name for the damned hero
i tol him that i didnot know except that he was the very young man and would he please leave me alone because i didnot want to be bothered of new coffee agency openings wilbin the next two weeks men and women will be given the opportunity to open up finepaying coffee agencies right in their own home localities

mail at once to president monmouth avenue cincinnati ohio the a complete novelette of doomsday panic by author oi in space
the hot mone menace etc i end earth was falling into the sun
there was no doubt about it
it was to be seen with ones own eyes
in the western hemisphere the people on the atlantic coast saw a swollen sun arise from the sea and distorted by uneven refraction it reared above the horizon like a giant eye of doom
it seemed to fishermen staring awestruck over the waters that this incredible sun that was four times larger than usual hung for a moment as though too heavy to rise
or as though it were gathering strength for a titanic effort to pursue its ageless course despite increased mass
there it hung for an instant
then like a cosmic bloated leech swelled by some nameless feast of celestial vampirism it shoved its ponderous unbelievable bulk above sea level puffed like a strained balloon insanely overgrown like a malignant toadstool this monster sun loomed into the sky defiling its pure dainty blue
the fishermen had seen many and in the back of his mind each many a sun swollen by refraction during the dawn but never had they seen such a huge orb spew from the eastern waves
and when the passage of an hour failed to reduce this awful faces destruction and only one person knew that the world was coming to an end nomenon and made it certain that it was to remain the fishermen frantically hoisted sail
their only thought was to flee from this ominous thing
faces white beneath the saltspray tan they turned away and refused to look again at the hideous enlarged globe of fire
the leviathan sun flamed its way up into the heavens
it seemed to man dares to match wits with the cosmos fuse the sky together so that it ran molten in streaks of ultramarine and glowing yellow
beneath it the ocean seemed to lose its deep bluegreen and become crystal clear because of the piercing flood of rays from above
then this stupendous sun as though lifted itself ponderously for all the people of that part of the world to see and a rising volume of fearful gasping cries seemed to swell upward from millions of throats
the sun
the sun was twice as wide as it should be
its face was four times larger than normal
what in the name of all the gods was happening
the answer came to all to some insidiously to others hammeringly to yet others explosively the sun is falling down on earth
or to the more scientificminded who were correct in little details earth is falling into the sun
einstein might have thought for an instant if any man could be so detached in nature ah a chance to demonstrate the basic principle of relativity at one stroke to all the world
for whichever way you put it sun onto earth or earth into sun the end result was the same great catastrophes and holocausts of the past paled into utter insignificance beside this one
the great chicago fire the fouryear carnage of the world war even the legendary sinking of atlantis what were they compared to this world doom
staggering millions had been wiped out by the black plague of medieval times perhaps onethird of the existing population but here all all must die there would be no younger generation to clean up and begin anew
this was that inconceivable thing death for all
the human mind no more than it can think upon its own personal death without an alarming unrest could not really grasp the thought of universal doom without going blank
minds that did fully absorb the horrific thought those minds went mad
but in the majority of people a temporary barrier of delusionary amnesia kept them from realizing what it meant when their cracked lips spoke out the doom
one can imagine people walking around like shellshock victims muttering everyone is going to die everyone on earth and then grinning foolishly at the absurdity
yet in the back of his mind each person knew knew in such a horribly positive way that all were going to die the whole world at once and as one
it ran like a moan through the seared atmosphere everyone is going to die everyone is going to die
everyone is going to die
a williams bay wisconsin a group of scientists both professional and academic got together at eight oclock in the morning of that day of doom
some had driven up from chicago others had come by train and bus one had even flown up there to yerkes observatory instinctively seeking out astronomical authority
the answer must be here
yet for all their hopes these men could not fail to notice that the air was tropically warm and the humidity almost insufferable
even if earth did stop its mad plunge sunward the increased temperature would drive civilization toward the poles
at last a murmur rose from the troubled crowd gathered at the towns small central park
a huge car rolled up and several figures stepped out almost before it had come to a stop
a group of four made its way to the rostrum where on summer evenings the municipal band gave its concerts
the crowd quieted down as whitehaired portly professor hargreave second official of the yerkes observatory nervously wiped his sweated face and confronted them
gentlemen i this is an honor ridiculous words yet the crowd did not laugh or smile politely to itself
momus himself god of laughter and merriment would have been powerless to wring a single chuckle from this grim dazed crowd
professor hargreave drew a long breath and continued well you all want to know what the official report on this this phenomenon is
a murmur o anxious assent came from the audience
well it seems that is dammit all gentlemen we have no report
and i donot know what you got me down here for in the first place
did you expect that if we said the earth was not falling into the sun that the thing would promptly change back to normal
what do your own eyes tell you
the crowd gasped and seemed to huddle together
about the only report i could give you is something you all know anyway
that the suns apparent diameter is almost twice normal which means that it has approached within fifty million miles
it is too early yet to figure the rate at which earth is moving he drev out the next word with an effort sunward but it must be at least at a speed of one thousand miles per second
unbelievable as it seems our planet is already as close to the sun as mercury at its furthest aphelion
the lag in rising temperature which should result can be explained by our dense atmosphere which is acting as a protective blanket
but when the atmosphere becomes saturated with heat he broke off as though the rest were too horrible and finished lamely thats all i can say he turned away with a gesture of dismissal
the crowd stirred but did not break up
it seemed reluctant to go away without some word of hope
but what word of hope could there be was about to step off the platform half angry at having been cajoled here to tell them that two plus two was four
hardly anyone noticed the calmfaced tall young man who threaded his way toward the rostrum and finally stepped on it
just a minute
a hundred pairs of eyes swung about in surprise stared at him curiously
the young man raised his yoice as he went on professor hargreave and gentlemen i can tell you something about this phenomenon
i can tell you for instance why earth is falling into the sun
you can tell us why
hargreave echoed and all the crovd echoed his words mentally
yes
the young man looked at them blandly
he seemed perfectly at ease
he paled a little though as he sensed a sudden murderous mood arising in the group
how did he dare to stand there calm and unafraid at a time like this
his face became serious suddenly can give you a reason for this event he said earnestly
fate thousands of miles away a drama concerning not millions of men but only two was being played in lonely isolation
the steaming furnace of the jungle had been around them for three days three sleepless grueling days
at last cabel turned like an infuriated animal
his gross bearded face sweaty and haggardly lined vorked savagely
damn you robinson youre killing me he panted sucking in the hot miasmal air with straining lungs
no sleep for two nights just march march march carrying both our packs and when i want water you torture me with a few drops
and these two bags of dust weigh a ton
i tel you i canot i wonot go on
the grin that came to young burt face was diabolic tell you youre killing me screamed cabel making a desperate lunge
burt sidestepped with a short harsh laugh and pulled out a pistol
it was own gun
cabel growling slid to one knee
he made a futile attempt to hunch the double pack off his aching tormented shoulders but knots held as they had for three days
the younger man wiped his sweaty hands on his shirt then took from his pocket a folded piece of paper opened it up
in his clear script were the words i confess to the murder of william johnson with a knife owned by mayla our native guide and porter whom i also murdered
signed ready to oblige rasped burt waving the paper
cabel looked up eyes like fevered coals between the matted hair hanging down over his forehead
never damn you going to last this out robinson see if i donot had twenty years of jungle and its never beaten me yet
they donot come any tougher than me
come on
cabel forced himself to rocking legs and staggered along the fernclogged trail
burt put avay the paper and followed
immediately with their exertion the frightful heat clothed them in almost unendurable suffocation
stabbing rays of the sun like molten bars of steel played a constant tattoo on their clothing whichalready seemed on fire
burt could not guess the temperature but he swore to himself it was the hottest day in history
but this torture of heat did not bother him as much as the fact that cabel was bearing up miraculously load short water rations and all
burt frowned
before nightfall they would reach the river
if cabel did not crack before then he might very well last it out
the row up the river would not be as much of a grind as this jungle trek
was cabel to win out in this grim game
at camp three days before while burt had been out hauling water from the spring cabel had knifed bill johnson in the back and then had shot mayla the indian porter whose knife he had used
burt robinson had been saved by returning unexpectedly by way of the rock path surprising cabel and getting the drop on him
burt had almost killed cabel in rage seeing agonized face but he could not kill a man even one like cabel in cold blood
thereupon he had decided to wring from him a confession to insure his punishment by law up at koniko
cabel had sneered confidently
then they had started on this journey into inferno with burt carrying the two guns and promising cabel the worst fiveday hell he had ever imagined
burt had no pity for the stumbling moaning man ahead of him
pity for him
for three years he cabel and bill johnson and faithful mayla had worked their bonanza
had sweated toiled laughed side by side
they had panned their dried well hidden creek bed for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in dust and small nuggets
enough for all
plenty hen cabel greedridden had revealed the cupidity he had held in check for those three years
he had planned the triple murder knowing a story of attack by wild indians backed by a generous heap of dust would carry at koniko
what incredible fortitude kept cabel on his feet after this threeday eternity of hellfire
even burt unencumbered felt himself on the verge of sunstroke
and he was younger stronger than cabel
the two men crossed an open patch of lushgrown ground and here the sun beat down with hammers of blinding flame
burt could not resist a maddened urge to curse the fiery orb above
a huge stinging drop of sweat touched one eyeball burning it so that he had to rub his eye clear but he looked again
and again raising his hand and peering through the fingers
his lips made a soundless exclamation of amazement
cabel was moving on doggedly head hanging
when they had crossed the clearing burt called a halt
cabel threw himself pack and all on the sawgrass beside the trail panting like a spent fox
his bloodshot eyes peered up mockingly from between the steaming tangle of his hair as burt stood over him
haul out 3our little paper sonny sneered cabel so i can spit at it he drew the flap of leather that was his tongue between his cracked lips burt looked down at the murderer
cabel he said sawing off the words you wonot live to enjoy the fortune we made going to face your maker with blood fresh on your hands stow it croaked cabel
you havenot the spunk to kill me
cabel look at the sun
the murderer peered upward toward the sun
his first careless glance changed to a wideeyed stare
an exclamation ripped from his heatlacerated lips
good god the matter with the sun he gasped the heats got us it looks too big
the heats going to get us you mean hissed burt steamily
cabel do you know what that means that we see
it means the earth is falling into the sun
it must have been going on for hours maybe days but we didnot notice
except that i think youll agree this has been the hottest three days weve ever had even in this sinkhole haggard face showed his abysmal fear
it canot be he mumbled swallowing with a throat that had nothing to swallow
maybe its a a mirage
whatever it is retorted burt grimly going on between heaven and earth not going to let up on you
get going
burt driving the murderer along pitilessly saw at last a chance to break him
let his tortured mind labor under the two burdens of secret murder and a burning doom while the aching sweating physical grind tore his nerves to shreds
when the afternoon sun a huge bloated orb reached its peak of hellish intensity cabel broke
screaming like a madman he flung himself tremblingly under a tree as if to hide from the pitiless sun growing he babbled saw it with my own eyes never heat like this before coming down on us why did i kill johnson
blood
bbod he confession was signed
they went on with burt carrying his own pack
burt had given cabel his fill of water
it was not till an hour later that burt realized the murderer had cracked completely
he listened horrified as the broken man in front hissed damn you sun you wonot get me going to hang me and burt robinson rowing a grinning vacanteyed cabel up the river felt for the first time in full force the stunning realization of doom
he had avenged the murder of his friend but to what avail if you can believe me gentlemen earnestly finished the young man in knickers
the crowd had not stirred since he first had begun to speak
just who are you demanded professor hargreave
well nobody confessed the young man with a wry grin
that is my name isnot known except to my friends and relatives and the minister who baptized me
the name is terry blackwell an amateur astronomer use an eightinch refractor homemade mounting neither here nor there puffy florid face was grim sweatbeaded
the thing is what proof have you for your ah quite harebrained explanation of this unprecedented phenomenon
proof
terry blackwell frowned a bit have proof of sorts
that is i have a series of photographs of the etherstrain in the past three months of its approach toward the sun
professor hargreave looked at him sternly
and you didnot reveal this knowledge or theory at least of yours till this last fatal moment
a look of angry pain came into the young mans eyes
this morning at a m
i tried to get an audience at yerkes he said slowly was refused admittance
a month ago i wrote a letter to yerkes offering to show my photographs but the reply vas a cold refusal signed by yourself it is not easy i can assure you for an amateur to gain a hearing
the yerkes astronomer flushed deeply
hargreave remembered the letter vaguely and recalled too that he had chuckled over it
strange how little things could turn up with the devastating force of a hurricane in the sweep of tumultuous events
well wel see your photographs said hargreave at last gruffly
where are they
at my home geneva hours drive responded terry
perhaps wed better hurry
hurry yes agreed the astronomer jerking himself up
come my car
stars in their courses before robert phd had said believe my ten years of research are coming to a head
atomic power lies just ahead
six months before he had stated the power of the atom can be released by a suitable concentration of cosmic rays
one month before he had cried excitedly look vogel my artificial cosmic rays already have the power to split the nitrogen atom
a week before he had spoken nervously vogel i dare not try it
who knows but vhat the release of total energy in even a thimbleful of gas might be the fuse to set the whole world aflame
but what are you going to do
vogel had asked
forget it for the time being had muttered
controlled atomic energy would be the worlds greatest blessing
but escaping it would be worlddestruction
since i donot know whether it is controllable with my ionized screen have to work out a sure method
there can be no halfcocked guesswork with this demonforce
and with assistance had begun what might well be the task of years to find a quencher that would as easily snuff atomic power as water puts out flame
then something had occurred to put a new face on the whole thing
vogel had announced it with a dazed expressionlessness had listened with a detached curiosity
come come man scoffed at last
what are you trying to say that the earth is falling into the sun donot know how else vogel said doggedly you can explain the sun being four times or more its usual size
why youre serious stated then he dashed outside his laboratory home to see for himself
everything was lit by an unnatural brightness this hot morning
people hurried here and there with fear on their faces put up his hand and squinted at the sun between his fingers
it was unmistakably a larger sun than had ever shone on earth in the history of man
what do you think sir
vogel asked when they went back inside
his lips trembled
he wiped perspiration from his forehead think its splendid retorted vithout sarcasm
vogel stared
but professor it means the doom of all earth everyone is going to die
exactly everyone is going to die
the old scientist looked speculatively at his young assistant
vogel do you think it would make much difference if everyone died a few hours beforehand
would you for instance care much if you died now or three days later if in both cases the deatn was inevitable
sir i donot understand i fool barked in quick temper
naturally the quicker death is the more desirable
death itself is not so terrifying the suspense of waiting for it is far worse that so
yes sir
but we donot know for sure the earth will plunge all the way to the sun
it may stop somewhere and take up a new orbit
that we must find out vogel
i want you to call up all the newspaper offices and radio stations and ask for official reports if any
his eyes held a peculiar light
in the meantime he whirled on the motionless dazed vogel
well he roared
the young assistant ran like a frightened rabbit
a half hour later he sought the scientist and found him down in the basement workroom tried everywhere vogel announced there have been no official reports from anywhere
the newspaper offices have pleaded with yerkes for a statement but they refuse as yet eyes still had a peculiar glint in them
do you know what that means vogel
their refusal to report means they fear the vorst
the earth is going to fall into the sun called my mother too murmured vogel biting his lip to hold back a scream that pressed in his throat
she wants me to come home frightened i guess
may i go sir
yes of course of course
the old scientists tone was preoccupied
he was busily engaged in examining the large electrical apparatus in the center of the room
professor what did you mean a while ago when you asked if i would prefer er death now or later
nothing
nothing at all hummed the aged scientist
he looked up fiercely as the assistant stood there
well
vogel left with the echoes of that peremptory roar
as soon as the assistant left ran to the door locked it
then he gazed at the apparatus with eagerness
here was the machine that could rend asunder a mere puff of gas and extract from it untold power
but the proof of it lay in the trying and so far he had not dared try
he had not dared to increase the intensity of his artificial cosmic ray beam to the point where it would not merely knock electrons loose from gas atoms but disrupt the nucfei themselves
in the nuclei lay the inconceivable hammer of atomic power
his cosmic rays were the hand that would wield that hammer heart began to pound madly an hour later when the apparatus had been made quite ready
one twist of that red dial and a titan would leap from the machine
but would his screen of ionized mercury hold the vortex of potential force
or would it burst free and hesitated at the last minute
his mind revolved again the train of thought that had brought him this far
earth was doomed by an inexplicable fail toward the sun
if the vortex escaped and accomplished its progressive disintegration of the earth it would simply be a quicker doom
but what if earth was not doomed by the sun
sweating felt his mind whirling
the driving allconsuming urge of ten years of striving toward this goal gathered itself and rolled forward like a juggernaut in his mind mowing down all other considerations
atomic power
controlled atomic power or holocaust
the low powerful hum of the internal transformers seemed to beat time to his throbbing thoughts dials seemed to stare at him like watching eyes
watching this man who had fate in his hands
power or destruction
which would it be grasped the red dial with a nervous hand
the die was cast
with a savage finality he twisted the rheostat control
he staggered back as a tremendous shock rocked the floor
the whine of great power sang through the apparatus closed his eyes waiting for the microcosmic explosion that would destroy a world
but the machine hummed steadily on he ran to the dials face alight
they told their story the story of ten billion watts accumulated within the mercury chamber
and it had held
he had succeeded in producing controlled atomic power
the earth had a legacy of endless costless power grounded the mercury chamber dazed in his triumph and watched the dials show the slow outpouring of ten billion watts into the capacious bosom of earth suddenly his face contorted horribly
his eyes swam in a film of bloodtears
for in this moment of victory a temporarily forgotten thought swept over him with crushing fury
irony of ironies
he had given this great gift to a world that would have no chance to use it
for the earth was plunging into the sun
terry blackwell shuffled through the pack of prints and finally picked out one
he handed it to professor about the best i took terry said
it shows quite clearly the distortions of the star field especially around its edges
hargreave wiped a rivulet of sweat from his cheek took the print eagerly
it showed a small portion of the night sky with an appreciable dusting of stars
just below center was noticeable a small patch in which the stars ran in curved streaks to form a circle
within that circle the star images were superimposed on one another to form a mottled design
the rest of these prints continued terry show the three months progress of the etherstrain among the background of constellations as it slowly but surely approached the sun
i did not know how close it was till one night it occulted jupiter that is it threw image about three minutes of arc out of place
then i knew it was comparatively close to earth hargreave and the officials with him looked over the prints carefully
one of the officials said finally this be a fault in the lens of your camera or in your telescope
strangely it was hargreave who took part then
no because the distortion takes different positions in the print which could not be explained that way
besides besides
i seem to recall that several prints were ruined recently up at the observatory by distortions exactly like these
we thought it was in the photographic paper and threw them away right said one of the officials remember that one print was ruined by a fault in scorpio about a month ago june sixth to be exact confirmed terry holding up the print for that date
if the group had had any serious doubts left they vanished utterl when this photograph showed the tail of scorpio twisted out of place
hargreave looked at terry with something of deep respect
young man he said excitedly think there isnot any doubt about it any more
incredible as it seems your etherstrain theory must be right
it plunged into the solar system or rather the solar system met up with it and as a result they all knev the result a great menacing sun that had apparently burst its linear bonds and become a threat of doom over a world of creatures who were in the last analysis less bound by the laws of man than the laws of nature
before a blanket of censorship had muffed the blarings of radio commentators an hour before there had been stark reports of rioting hundreds suicidal thousands hysterical millions in europe which had already viewed the brobdingnagian sun for twelve hours
what was happening in america the lord only knew
hargreave glanced at his watch
it was ten oclock
wiping off the sweat sprinkled over his boiledlooking skin with a limp and already saturated handkerchief he gasped telephone
quickly
sunrise jose estaban was calm and proud with his back against the high stone wall of the prison courtyard
if there were any mental worms gnawing at his brain it did not show on his saturnine face with its mocking smile
he had been that way the night before during the hasty military trial
the solemn dark faces of the enemy had filled with hate as they turned to him
there had been the forma recital of his many acts of espionage
then the faces had turned to triumphant glee as the headofficer pronounced the sentence in cold harsh tones jose estaban known as el disblo espia your crimes against the nation of bolivia merit death
fucilado a la solida del sol you will be shot at sunrise
jose estaban looked up and saw the rosy fingers of approaching dawn tremble through the gloom
the ten men of the guard at an order from their captain made a right turn on their heels and marched toward the farther wall against which lay ten rifles
jose stared stolidly ahead
el capitan stalked up
blindfold senor
he tendered a black cloth
jose smiled the saturnine smile that had won him the name of the devil spy
save it mi capitan he murmured softly for mourning when el chaco boreal the land for which we fight passes into the hands of paraguay
brave words for a dead man leered the captain
he whirled and to a position beside the ten riflemen
as he glanced impatiently out the east gate for the sun his lieutenant spoke in his ear would it not be best mi capitan to have the men fire right now even though the sun has not yet risen lest he escape in some way
the puerco will not escape
five times before was he captured and five times he escaped reminded the underofficer
he rolled his eyes superstitiously
they say the devil himself watches over this man
caramba
look how he grins as he stands there as though he expects not to die but to have the laugh over us
the men are nervous too and silence perro hissed the bolivian captain
there is no miracle can save him
we will wait for a punctual sun to give the signal of his death
but as the slow minutes passed in ominous silence with the flush of nearsunrise growing in strength even the toughsouled captain became nervous
the men fidgeted shuffled their feet
the lieutenant stood with mouth half open as if prepared at any moment to see the devil himself arrive and whisk his protege away
for el diablo espia had been almost a myth for two years one whose activities had been devilishly cunning
in the gloom the spys eyes seemed to gleam like small fires
his lips were curled in mockery
suddenly his eyes flicked to the eastgate and widened slightly
for there he saw a girl white arms straining to tear down the solid bars of steel
at the same time the tip of the sun peeped over the horizon and a shaft of brightness speared into the shadowy courtyard
el capitan awaiting this signal raised an arm
the riflemen brought up their guns took aim
a scream intercepted the word fucil the bolivian captain glanced toward the gate saw the girl and motioned for the men to lower their rifles
el capitan was of the old school with chivalry deeply imbedded in his nature
he strode toward the girl at the eastgate
senorita i beg of you to depart for the time
it is no pretty sight this
particularly for so charming a girl eyes aflame the girl spoke tremulously mi capitan please do not kill this man
make him a prisoner instead till the war is over catamba
are you mad
he is our nations worst enemy
then let me go to him die with him pleaded the girl wildly love him i sheltered him for many days before he was captured so i am a traitor to bolivia
do you hear
you must kill me with him because i am a traitor
diablo
that is impossible senorita
i will not believe it
more it is foolishness
you cannot die with him
then let me be with him for a tiny moment i will do anything anything if you will grant me that
the stern look on the face dissolved to reflection
you love this man si
you will do anything to be with him for a moment si
you will perhaps let me do all in my power to comfort you afterward
comprendo lovely one
soft black eyes tragic the girl nodded
let me in to him and you will not regret it
grinning in satisfaction the captain called for one of his men to open the steel gate
but one minute i will give you he admonished the girl
like a bird seeking its nest the girl ran to jose enfolded him in trembling arms
the doomed man lifted up her face kissed her tenderly
in some afterlife we will be reunited nina
our love cannot die
they clung to one another fiercely for a moment then jose pushed her away firmly
but go now
death awaits me mi dies
then with you i die
the girl flung herself about faced the firing squad with her body in front of his
at the other side of the courtyard the men watching this scene exchanged glances
the devil doom was being delayed as if death itself were reluctant to take him
a flood of rays from the east gate now lit up the tableau with supernal brightness
the girls white clothes seemed to expand into a blazing cloak that hid the man behind
el capitan cursed and started forward
when he had gone half way a dark streak plunged toward the east gate
it was el diablo espia making a run for the steel portal that had been carelessly left unlocked after the entrance of the girl
shoot him kill him screamed the bolivian captain frantically jerking out his own pistol
the distance vas a hundred feet
of the ten men tnat brought up their rifles one must surely have aimed true
but only one bullet was fired that of el capitan and it failed to stop the flying man even though it made a trail of spattered blood over the grey cobblestones
the rest of the men stood staring toward the eastgate watched el diablo espia escape from it
it was not him they watched however
it was the incredible thing beyond heir widening dazed eyes beheld the enormous bulk of an enchanted sun now hanging just over the horizon
it was the color of the droplets of blood that marked the escaped spys trail
misshapen by refraction it floated there like the gargantuan heart of some celestial cyclops
cloud wisps scurrying by made it seem to pulsate with nameless life
it was a wizards trick and the bolivian riflemen as they reeled back in fright had no doubt that it was the doing of the devil himself to insure the escape of his ward the devil spy
professor hargreave slammed down the receiver in disgust get washington for love or money he said explosively suppose every crank and fool in the country is on the wire
talk about a voice crying in the wilderness he jumped to his feet
but something has to be done
you bradley take my car and get to milwaukee as fast as you can
get a general sage over the radio if you have to buy out a station
we canot let anything stop us
kincaid you take a plane for washington and get to somebody high up if you have to murder to do it
in the meantime try to get a call on the phone through so one of the three of us ought to get our message across
get going men
the tvro men dashed out faces set in determination
hargreave turned immediately to the telephone barking into it viciously
when long distance had completed his connection he rapped dr morris birge director of biology hurry over his shoulder he said half mumblingly to terry a government man
agricultural bureau
connections in what
for a moment he listened then hung up slowly
his eyes were pained as he turned to terry
suicide he muttered dazedly
an hour ago swallowed a dose of curare
my friend
one night he confided in me that his wild passionate youth weighed heavily on his mind
but for him to the astronomers eyes changed suddenly
he grabbed up the phone again hopefully
a few minutes later he jumped to his feet with a curse
velter dead too he groaned
shot this morning during a jailbreak at joliet prison
he was a hot on the trail of somebody down there
now hes gone too
i donot know who to try next for a contact at the white house
but i must have it
maybe i can help cried terry
he continued at gruff well
senator jordan has a summer home here in geneva
just down the street
if hes home come on shouted hargreave pushing his bulk toward the door at an actual run
they went out into the hot afternoon
since dawn the overgrown sun had increased its girth by another diameter
it was now nine times as large in face area as normally
the heat teemed insufferable the house there pointed terry and a moment later they were panting up the steps of a broad shaded verandah
pray god hes here exclaimed hargreave fervently
cosmic laughter god of irony looked down on 
earth that day and laughed
he saw a world of creatures disturbed from their normal pursuit of life and it was funny to watch their painful antics
in new york a drunk who had made his usual nightly rounds saw the dawn of an impossible sun and laughed himself to sleep on somebodys doorstep in the thought that pink elephants and snakes were passe
near chicago two gangsters returning from a ride with blood fresh on their hands stared amazedly superstitiously at the bloodred titan sun and ran headon into a milk truck dying instantly
the god of irony laughed louder
a young man up all night in his shabby rentdue room bitterly convinced that life was not worth living if one could not work and eat withdrew the fatal blade from near his throat at the sound of outside shouting that came with the dawn and when learning of the sundoom cursed the fate that was inevitably going to end his life while he was so young
after three days and nights of unselfish sleepless labor their rescue tunnel reached the cavein and they brought up the buried miner in the dawn of that fateful day and his tears of joy and relief changed into a raging curse when he learned that he had escaped one doom only to be in time for another
an early bird evangelist haranguing a gullible audience gleefully launched into his pet theme of hellfire and brimstone from which there was no escape except through becoming the soul of purity and repentance tha he was but one could never describe the strange green color of his apoplectic face when the sundoom became manifest
a patient earnest astronomer gave a shout of joy to the amazement of his colleague who had just announced the news of earth falling intothesun and exulted now get superlative photographs of the sunspots perhaps solve their mystery
brushing back his long hair the starving poet again invaded the offices of the news
this time the weary editor accepted some of his work thinking any junk will do for a filler today
and at the same time that the poet inwardly exulted perhaps at long last they see what i am trying to say
maybe this is a beginning for me the god of irony was now doubled up with uncontrollable mirth
a prima donna threw back her head and sang to the small musicthirsty audience sang as never before sang in the face of certain doom gloriously triumphantly with magnificent defiance strangely free of the haunting fear that her voice was failing
for the first time in months yearsshe was giving a performance of real brilliance a performance that was to go down into oblivion
destined to produce a masterpiece an author scribbled away madly all day in his locked room unaware of the doom that threatened to make his production worthless
a the janitor awoke with great joy in his heart for the day before he had cashed in his sweepstakes ticket and today he would begin spending it in glorious abandonment but an hour later little lights of madness came into his eyes as the overbrilliant sunlight shone on a fistful of green papers with numbers on them
the god of irony cast his merry eyes over the rest of the world to see what other insanely amusing things there were among these queer beings who had mind and imagination
down in africa two warring bloodthirsty tribes spent the day watching the fantastic puffed sun with superstitious eyes but as night came they fell to their fighting with unabated vigor in the light of a full moon
the mandarin smoothed his silken robes thoughtfully after hearing that the celestial fire was about to consume earth for its sins then ordered his frightened servants out bidding them go to the writings of confucius for comfort and when alone he took a strong pair of shears to clip off the fourinch long finger nails that had secretly irked him all his life
marsch shouted the nazi kommandant and when a whitefaced underofficer pointed mutely up at the supersun the kommandant shook his head fiercely saying this all day marching drill with full pack goes on should hell itself come to earth
marsch
babbitt had had a wonderful two weeks in the south seas idle days soft moonlit nights darkeyed women music it had been heavenly and when awakened at noon the news struck him like a physical blow so that he wailed knew it couldnot last
the god of irony had had a marvelous day hut his laughter stopped suddenly
oogli the eskimo up in the far arctic went complacently on with his fishing and skinning for the sun could not rise here to astonish him for two more months of nighttime
up in the mountains the blind hermit continued to fill his simple contented soul with the poetry of babbling brooks and caroling birds blissfully unconscious of the huge glowering sun over his head
and a parkbench philosopher typical of his kind watched the madness of panicstricken mankind with a secret pity that they were so fearful of death
senator james jordan came to the door in a maroon bathrobe over pajamas whose brilliantly striped pant legs showed at the bottom
he yawned
up late last night or this ing he explained with an apologetic grin away
guess alone in the house
funny mrs riggs our housekeeper hasnot showed up yet
damned hot this morning
well what can i do for you gentlemen he started as he looked again at their faces
say whats up
you two look like the end of the world is coming
not we two the world looks like that said hargreave dryly
he pointed through the foliage of the tall trees that shaded the porch
look at that sun sleepy look changed to startled bewilderment with the speed of a lightning flash
he rubbed his eyes looked again then turned dazedly to his visitors
the earth is falling into the sun the earth is falling into the sun of course said hargreave impatiently perhaps a little sneeringy at the senators helplessness he who could harangue election crowds for hours over nothing at all a story benind this that i canot go into now too short
what here for is a telephone connection with the white house
in fact with the president himself or secretary of war or somebody in high authority
senator got to have it
what can you do
the senator managed to shake off his bewilderment and to quell the icy panic in his heart
he put through a call on the phone when they had entered the house
after forty minutes of sweating shouting blustering effort while hargreave and terry stood by anxiously jordan announced that he had the secretary of office on the wire
hargreave grabbed the phone eagerly began speaking with the vords coming out in a tumble
in a period of twentyfour hours the incredible overgrown sun had revealed itself to all the peoples of earth from greenwich to far india from the arctic to the antipodes
and as it climbed the skies it grew ever larger and fiercer and in like degree the peoples fears grew larger and fiercer
for a while things went calmly
centuries and ages of civilizing restraint became a bulvark against rising terror and madness
authorities broadcast soothing but unconvincing statements that the earth would undoubtedly take up a new orbit
there were little cases of violence and madness here and there that grew with the rapidity of an explosion
a reign of terror started
the less page the depressions over
again this is the land of opportunity
every day you see alert young men being skyrocketed to the top you wondered what the secret is
well many things go to make up success
but one thing is absolutely necessary
good health
and constipation is contrary to perfect health
it can rob you of looks energy ambition likely to pass up opportunities liable to miss the boat
so if you want to step up your energy f you want a quick mind and a healthy body remember this one thing ee that your bowels move regularly
but the way you move your bowels is important
instead of taking a laxative that disturbs your system and upsets your stomach take gentle exlax
exlax limits its action entirely to the intestines where the actual constipation exists
it gives the intestines a gentle nudge emptying the bowels thoroughly but easily and comfortably
exlax in such a simple commonsense way
and it is such a pleasure to take
exlax tastes just like delicious chocolate
at all drug stores 10c and 25c
canada 15c and 35c strained more panicky element of population cast all judgment to the wind and became maddened beasts
bloodshed and violence spread their gory fingers over the world
a tidal wave of insanity suicide and lawlessness followed the giant sun around the planet
the puny barriers of law and order sufficient ordinarily were as though nonexistent before this new wave of worldpanic
everyone is going to die that was the terrible sword that began to lay civilization low
if everyone was going to die in a few hours or days what did anything matter what did law and order and morality mean nothing in the face of this cataclysmic doom
it was a black page in the history of civilization that day
as the supersun rose to midday heights over any certain longitude the masses underneath launched into reckless careers
each did as his buried inclinations dictated without regard for others
the most secret of inhibitions came to light of day
murder rapine insanity stalked the lands
fires riots mob violence swelled the days mad doings
feats of heroism and sacrifice occurred side by side with unnameable atrocities sprang up and grevz to giddy heights in the course of a few hours
unnumbered homes were emptied whose occupants would never again come back
thousands of children cried piteously for parents who were dead or missing
saints were born that day and devils
a legion of good samaritans struggled to allay the pain and torture and misfortune that rode the world roughshod
there were those who preached and those who comforted and those who spread calm like oil on troubled waves
but there were those many who sadistically set about displaying their twisted mental complexes
a nd over it all rode the monster sun symbol of doom
its actual effect was more mental than anything for neither the increased heat or light could account for what went on
it was just its constant inexorable insidious presence overhead that pressed on shocked brains
an earthquake strikes the heart with sharp terror but leaves the mind free to think ahead to eventual escape barring bad luck
but this immense sun this sun of doom growing ever larger sucking the earth into its maw of superflame left no room for hope
from the pulpit it was called the judgment sun coming down to fulfill the prophecy of the day of doom
the way things were going the civilized world would be a shambles by evening of that first day
what it would be the next day no one dared speculate
the final unthinkable picture was that of a planet half of whose population was dead and the other half insane plunging sunward
and where was the word of hope
where was an atlas to come to the rescue and hold up the falling heavens
or was earth inevitably doomed
at about one oclock in the middle of the hemisphere a concerted gasp went up from the land
a spark had been ignited at yerkes and spread from there like wildfire
a second spark had grown at washington and its greater flood of waves spanned the atlantic and later the pacific
the pulse that began to beat strongly at washington set up resonant pulses in london paris berlin moscow and finally bombay hongkong tokyo sydney capetown
from these centers the blessed spark spread from city to city from community to community by radio telegraph telephone and the printed page
a great hush came over earth
its furious travail ceased
dazed eyes dimmed with tears
torn hearts ceased to bleed
shrieks turned to soft sobs
terror gave way to relief
fear vanished into shame
people whispered the news to one another earth is not doomed the increased size of the sun is an illusion there is nothing to worry about
end of the doom he prayer of thanks that arose from millions of hearts must have inundated the elysian shores of heaven above
but the god of irony laughed most over this for he had seen the grimmest play in all history enacted with a backdrop of illusion
he had watched scientists take heat measurements early in the day and find a barely noticeable increase in the average heat
they had tried to had made triangulation calculations that night with the planets and had found nothing changed from normal
but their message although faster than the course around earth had made no impression for wasnot it likely that all the planets as well as earth were falling toward the sun
numerous other little things each sufficient in itself to prove the illusion to the reasoning mind revealed the cosmic hoax gravity and tide observations light pressure tests the paradoriical exactness of sunrise
but they had gone unheeded these prophets of the illusion for in one sntermolecular life threatens to subjugate earth a complete novelette of worlds within worlds by in the issue spread the word that earth could not be nearer the sun but to no avail
by a mad coincidence that fateful day had been one of the hottest of the year
the imagination of mans mind had swelled the temperature to unreasoning heights
seeing is believing never before had that platitude been demonstrated with more irresistible force
observatories in asia vhich continent had first seen the phenonienon detail they had all failed in their message to unreasoning multitudes
not one of them had thought to give a reason for the illusion
terry explanation owed its sudden universal acceptance to the fact that it accounted for the illusion as well as named it such
terry blackwell found himself a world figure by midnight
saved from further terror relieved of black heartchilling despair the population demanded a hero of worship for the soothing message of peace
he tried to escape it but at midnight found himself standing before a microphone on a worldwide hookup
what shall i say gulped terry nervously
professor hargreave smiled indulgently
it doesnot matter much what you say
you could say and they would take it for pearly wisdom
but you may as well give the world a resume of your whole theory just about as you gave it up at yerkes this morning
but the theory is wild guesswork pleaded terry
it happens to account for the illusion by luck perhaps not a real scientist at all
if youre not a real scientist like to meet one said hargreave
he signaled to the commentator
the latter who had been frantically waving for them to approach the microphone and had been filling the time with the usual playup sighed in relief
people of earth he concluded realizing the tremendousness of the occasion in that phrase people of earth i give you now mr terry blackwell the young man who this day proved the great illusion and gentlemen it was about three months ago terry began that i photographed saturn with my eightinch refractor telescope
the print showed a small faint distortion in one corner
the next night i tried again and found an identical fault in the photograph
from then on with more luck than skill i succeeded in trailing the almost unnoticeable distortion photographically as it moved across the stars
it was quite invisible by visual observation
i followed it with photography for those three months and unmistakably it grew larger and more pronounced one evening it cama abreast of jupiter magnified it and threw it out of line as well as the immediate field of stars
that indicated that this giysterious enigma was close to us already between earth and jupiter
not having the necessary mathematical skill to plot its course i had no idea it would eventually come between earth and sun
but it did and in doing so caused the enlargement of the sun we have observed
about a week ago i started seriously thinking of an explanation for it
what strange thing at least the size of the sun transparent but highly refractive could be drifting through space
since it was completely uncatalogued in modern science i had a clear field in which to speculate
as a result worked out a theory for it which later scientific research may modify but it is this somewhere and sometime in the cosmos a dense and dark star like the companion of sirius collided with another large star and vas knocked out of its normal orbit in the universe or fused with it to become a nova
this dead star must have been incredibly dense perhaps half composed of neutronium which weighs sixty million tons to the cubic inch
and its gravitational field must have been immeasureably stronger than any we know
so strong in fact terry drew a long breath and continued for he knew that hundreds of astronomers and other scientists would be listening so strong in fact that the warp it produced in space became permanent thus when the dead star itself was knocked away the etherstrain it had made went on in the old orbit
like the shell of a nut continuing to exist long after the kernel which grevy it has been eaten awav by worms
the collision itself may have happened untold trillions of years ago and perhaps in some other galaxy
but the etherstrain pursued its lone course unaffected by the laws that govern the rest of the universe and came finally to our galaxy and our solar system
by deduction from its low velocity it must have entered the solar system within the orbit of pluto about five years ago but it would have been impossible to detect it then for even so bright an object as the sun looks merely like a star from distance
and this etherstrain is absolutely invisible
it was not detectable till it had approached quite near within onehalf billfbn miles and then only as a faint smudge on a sensitive photographic plate
so it may be said that the etherstrain sneaked up on us like an invisible snake
i count it only as great good luck that i happened to catch it on my plate since it only took up about one millionth of the total sky area
after entering the solar system and because its velocity relative to the sun was just a little more than orbital velocity it contrived to hang in between earth and sun for these many hours
its huge area is very gradually drawing ahead of the earth and will in a few hours undoubtedly clear away
there is only one thing left to mention and explain the way it magnified the suns image
the effect of such a magnification will be understood if it is compared to a telescope lens with a high refractive index but a very long focus
like a giant handglass this sphere of warped space hung between the direct rays of the sun and earth and bent the light rays to a focus for earthly eyes
the etherstrain has the ability to bend light in accordance with laws but in a greater degree than ever observed before because its warp of space is greater than we have ever known
paradoxically this warp does not have any gravitational influence as it should have for einstein says the force of gravity is simply a curvature of space
this can be explained by assuming that when space has been abnormally warped its gravitational effects link into a closed circle no longer able to exert external influence
and so concluded terry this extremely startling phenomenon in our skies today has been merely an optical illusion
hargreave had a moment before he received a paper from the announcer
he stepped before the microphone as terry backed away
the kioto observatory in japan he read reports that the sun that has just risen over their land is once again normal
the phenomenon lasted exactly twentyeight hours

the thrice in the annals of man the human race is faced with extinction
by microscopic giants dives deep etc author or links in the chain of humanity he sentinels of the tree people crouched in the highest branches of their communal dwelling place and stared fearfully toward the west
beneath them the activities of the tree village were stilled
men women and children crouched on quivering haunches each near a tree bole up which quick ascent could be made if necessary
the strings of tough vines crudely fastened from tree to tree making a sort of rough platform thirty feet above the teeming ground were empty
the hairy mightythewed folk crouched and stared as the sentinels in the treetops above did toward the west
there where the whitehot sun was dying was the danger source
from there death came death on two colossal hind legs towering as high as a tree itself
when the hairy tree people built their aerial village thirty feet above the deathinfested ground they had hoped to know a new safety
for a while they had
the sabertoothed tiger the monstrous serpent the great bear were baffled by that height
they could be beaten off by stone ax and club before they reached it
but this new menace which threatened the very race made a mockery of their sanctuary
in the highest branch of the conifer tree in the center of the aerial village crouched taljuck the quick
near him was the gorillalike form of ank strongest man of the tribe thick lips moved and guttural chattering sounds were articulated through his heavy protruding jaws
it was not language it was a series of symbolic sounds painting simple pictures of the mind
you think the great one will come on this sundeath
taljuck grunted
his jaws were not quite so bestial as those of the other hairy folk
his forehead was a little higher his eyes a little clearer
his enormous hairy hands tightened on the odd contrivance he had made during the last four days
who can say
sometimes the great one comes sometimes it does not
but when it does come it is always at this hour muddy brutish eyes went to the queer invention in hands
you are going to try that on the great one
yes
if it comes looked at the new weapon born of his brain
fierce pride was in his eyes
it was a tough curved length of wood nearly four inches through
from end to end of this was a tiger tendon scraped as thick as his little finger
a long straight stick with a sharp stone was tied to one end
taljuck placed the blunt end of the stick on the tendon stretched the heavier stick in a great arc then relaxed it
the bow and arrow had been born of brain though its birth was not to be credited for thousands of centuries and through it tribe was to reign supreme for the lives of ten thousand succeeding generations
this cannot kill so great a beast at once
but it can pass through the throat and later the thing will die
you can send that stick through the great throat echoed ank
taljuck fingered the pointed stone at the end of the crude arrow
eons later men were to find that and think it a peculiarly shaped axhead not realizing the enormous muscles of the men that could use it as an arrowhead
it will pierce the fhroat
i know what it can do a scream arose from below
it came from the downy lips of a young girl sor the farseeing
it comes
it comes
i see the great head
the tree people rushed here and there chattering like great apes
one child fell the hairy mother swung monkeylike to the ground caught up her offspring clambered to the heights again
to the heights that did not protect against so huge a thing as the great one
the sentinels biggest and strongest men of the tree folk grunted excitedly to one another
all but taljuck
taljuck was silent bracing himself in the treefork with hairy legs while his great hands flexed and loosed the bow and arrow first of great inventions
in the semicircle made by the white sun sinking over the horizon a head appeared
it was a reptilian head colossal its gaping jaws studded with huge teeth
a short vast throat appeared then the rest of the body
the body was a mountain of lizardflesh and bone carried on two inconceivably enormous legs with a great tail to help its blundering balance
it hitched over the ground crushing young trees making the steamy earth tremble
and as it neared the tree village it reared higher so that its incredible head was above the level of the hairy peoples sanctuary
the great one they called it
long long later it was to be named from its remains
tyrannosaurus rex the most ferocious animal ever known
this was an anachronism perhaps the last of its kind on earth a freak vivor o a species supposed to have died out miliions of years before the appearance of the hairy folk
but the tree people did not know that
all they knew was that suddenly moons ago this enormous thing had appeared over the skyline at sunset stalked to their village and taken five of their number as a tall man might pluck five green gourds in a high tree and gulp them down
since then the great one had come at irregular intervals and always four to seven of their number went down that tremendous maw
bowing to the great one and worshiping it giving it sacrifices voluntarily had not placated it
the tribe was in danger of extinction unless two sticks could somehow save it
to the highest branches scuttled the tree folk there to cling like furred fruit
but the highest branches were not high enough
the trees mighty of girth were not lofty
a roaring whoosh of air was expelled from the great throat and its basilisk eyes fastened on sor the farseeing after scream ripped from her lips
her face just becoming downy with the fine hairs of adolescence was the color of a lizards belly
the other tree folk chattered and moaned
taljuck bent the great bow
the great jaws gaped as it lumbered toward the tree in which sor clung paralyzed
vine catwalks were swept away like thread by the monsters bulk
there was a last shriek a dry clashing of teeth taljuck
strike ank grunted in anguish
in the hands of taljuck the quick the big bow quivered at its full arc
but the great one was yards from his perch
he did not yet send the long stick with the sharp stone on it singing forth as he had learned to do in the days before
the tyrannosaurus as though drawn ay appalled but steady eyes turned toward his tree
it lumbered there
ank chattered and shriesed in ihe tree beside him
strike
taljuck
strike but still with steady eyes taljuck held the arrow taut on the tiger tendon
the great one crashed within ten yards
shrilling despairing cries ank loosed his hold and fell plummetlike to earth risking death by the fall rather than face the monster longer
he moaned and grunted on the ground with both legs broken so tne bone protruded through the hairy flesh which meant lingering instead of quick death
and taljuck with a grunt released his stonetipped stick
with a thin shriek the arrow cleaved the air
the sharp stone hit the leatherarmored throat of the great one and went on in
the arrow driven by a force such as is unknown to any muscular framework of man today buried itself almost to its blunt end in the lizards flesh
the monster stopped its rush
its short front legs went up and its claws raked at the thing that stuck out like a splinter from its streaming neck
then with an earsplitting scream of air from its cavernous body it came on toward taljuck
taljuck clung to his treefork as paralyzed as sor had been
the great one was not at all harmed by the arrow it seemed
dimly its lowordered nervous system informed its tiny brain that it had been hurt but its vast strength was unimpaired
it got to tree lunged against it reached for the hairy human midge with gaping jaws
taijuck the quick stared at the gaping maw which was streaming gouts of red from the transfixing arrow
the great bow dropped from his nerveless hands
from other high points the tree folk screamed and chattered and moaned
the branch on which taljuck had been was empty
it quivered still with the force of clutching hands that had been torn from it and that was all
taljuck the quick first inventor was pulp in the toothstudded mouth
but what was this
the great one though only two odi es had gone into its mouth was not crashing after more
it stood motionless beside the tree in which taljuck had clung
its expressionless eyes looked toward the west not toward extra victims
a thundering bubbling airrush came from its transfixed throat
blood and hairy fragments that it could not swallow geysered from its maw
it lurched slowly away from the aerial village
for a long moment the hairy people watched it go unable to understand
then the first timid shout of deliverance keened out to grow to a chattering grunting chorus
the great one was being driven away stonetipped stick had beaten it
three days later the tribe feasted on the mound of flesh that lay off toward the west
ordinarily no death of a man was remembered for three days individually in the dim minds of these folk
but they remembered because he had saved the tribe
they feasted in name and the men of the village fashioned long sticks to bend like his and send stonetipped lances into the flesh of other animals
taljuck the quick was dead but the tribe lived on saved by the living fruit of his brain rom their mountain observatories all over the world the astronomers peered up the magnifying channels of their threehundred and telescopes
in the teeming cities around them activities were stilled
men women and children stood hushed in the streets and they stared as the astronomers did up into the sky
for every mans fearful eye and every mans appalled thoughts in the year were on the same object
the moon
from that heavenly ball hanging balloonlike now in the cloudless sky it seemed that the death of the human race was coming
for the moon was dying and in its extinction it promised to upheave earth so that no tiny human mite perhaps no life at all would be left on its surface
the human race had thought itself in a position to live a tranquil and untroubled existence on earth forever
it had outlawed the horrible wars that had nearly decimated civilization several centuries ago
it had solved the food problem producing sustenance for earth billions with only a few hours of work a day for each individual
it had prolonged the span of life to an average of a hundred and ten years
man was firmly enthroned he had thought
and for a time this had been true
but now this cataclysmic menace from the heavens threatened the entire human race
in the mount everest observatory
professor talmadge turned from the eyepiece of the telescope which was so powerful that it would have revealed a man walking on the moons surface had there been one there to walk
he stared at his assistant tohiki the end he said
the moon is falling toward earth at a rapidly accelerating rate tohiki nodded dark slanting eyes shining with sad intelligence even if it fell no further he said it would be the eventual end both were silent thinking of the catastrophes that had begun at once with the moons inexplicable subsidence back toward the planet from which it had been torn a million million years ago
all over the world earthquakes of unbelievable violence had destroyed cities drained great lakes created new ones changing map at the incidental cost of millions of lives
all over the world volcanic eruptions had burst forth on a terrifying scale
active volcanoes had belched more molten rock in a year than in all their recorded history before
old volcanoes became alive again
new ones formed in the most unlikely places one ten miles across its jagged new crater spouted through ancient rock in the alleghanies obliterating all human life as far north as new york and as far south as washington
but the worst of the disasters were the floods ever increasing in height and severity
at each high tide the water of the seven seas rolled to new heights pulled by the increasing drag of the moon
daily tidal waves mounted with their roaring crests loftier than they had been the day before coastal cities of any nation were in existence any longer a few twisted metal stubs showed where tall buildings had been
a few weedwracked lines of broken stone indicated streets when they could be seen at all under lowtide depths
all human beings save those millions who had been engulfed by the encroaching sea had long since fled to the inland mountains
and still the moon comes closer murmured the japanese
still it comes closer nodded talmadge
and it will continue to approach
it will reach the point where the ocean tides rage over the whole face of the earth daily
they will submerge all land even this great crest
nothing but marine life will endure
in fact even that may perish for at this point the moon will probably burst and surround earth with a belt of a million tiny moons that will blanket us from the sun so that our planet freezes intelligent eyes went to a small drawing hung on the observatory wall
that may save us he said
talmadge shrugged
there is perhaps one chance in ten that a choice few of people may survive the coming disasters in the talmadge retreat
if anything can save us that can
the astronomer who was that rare scholar a man of general accomplishments in varied fields of science walked to the drawing and studied it with proud yet faultfinding eyes
read in scale the drawing showed a cavern ten miles across with a rounded roof a quarter of a mile high which was supported by rows of enormous metal pillars
the cavern was in the base of a mountain indicated by dotted lines the outline of the dotted lines was that of everest itself showing that the depicted cavern must be under the feet of the two men
shall we call the elected few tonight said tohiki
talmadge bit his lips
his eyes farseeing and keen narrowed
then he nodded
yes
tonight
we know what is to happen so shortly
there is no reason for delay
and tohiki only two thousand people the best of every walk of life understand said tohiki
death was in his eyes as it was in the eyes of talmadge
but the coming cataclysm was too great for anything but utter desperate calmness
particularly you want engineers that can handle the atomdisrupter
yes
that by all means replied talmadge
tohiki left the observation chamber
talmadge went over in his mind for the thousandth time the one thing that made oarely possible the preservation of human life on earth
the talmadge retreat
no it vas not that
anyone can excavate a great cave at a mountains base
it is another matter to feed and clothe two thousand people in it and give them air to breathe over centuries of time
this talmadge hoped to do with his atomdisrupter
it was the last great invention of mankind one which by its very simplicity had baffled science for centuries
all matter is similar in that it is made from the same building blocks
one substance is made different from another only in that its atoms have varying numbers of protons and electrons
it had been known for a long time that if atoms could be disintegrated to their component parts and the parts rearranged any desired element could be produced from the elemental debris
furthermore any substance could be contrived synthetically by controlled molecular arrangement
starkly ferociously simple this fact
and with stark ferocious simplicity talmadge had solved the equation
he disrupted atoms with heat
but such heat
three million degrees centigrade produced for a few millionths of a second by electrical discharge through high tension vacuum tubes
it could not be kept up longer for fear of burning out the apparatus but those few millionths of a second were enough to strip atoms readdition of electrons to produce any given element
ah that had been more difficult
but talmadge had solved it in experiments no less sublime for being empirical he had discovered that different degrees of heat produced different elements and had the differences tabulated
thus by a variation of a few hundred thousand degrees he could take stripped atoms and give you what you liked from hydrogen to uranium
from then on it was a mere matter of synthesis to produce anything from the air you breathed to the food you ate out of rock metallic ores or anything else at hand
there were slight variations between the synthetic and the real products oxygen for example had an atomic weight of instead of but these differences had no practical results
thus with the socalled atomdisrupter talmadge proposed to keep two thousand human beings existing for indefinite centuries in a cave under the base of everest until such time as the planet returned to something like normality after the moons disruption once more allowing life on its surface
talmadge sighed
he thought his mighty invention was perfected
if it was the human race had a slight chance of survival
if it was not soberly he looked around the observatory for the last time absently patted the magnesium rim of the tremendous telescope reflector plate
then he went out into the sparkling cold air of crest and stepped onto the slowspeed strip of the endless escalator which in its highspeed outer edge took him toward the mountains base at forty miles an hour
within ten hours all were assembled in the great cavern in the bowels of the mountain
there were men and women of the highest standing in all branches of science
there were men and women picked because of eugenic physical factors to keep up the body stamina of the race
there were a few old men chosen for their extensive learning but in the main it was a young crowd
talmadge knew well how necessary for blind race survival was a sound physique
the cave in which these people were to live and their descendants after them for unimaginable centuries was ready
in the center a domed building rose that was the heart of the place from that went a shaft halfway to the core of the earth
up this shaft came internal and eternal beat to be transmuted into plentiful power
around the shafthead were the bank rows of atomdisrupters where all necessities of life were to be manufactured
tinned food enough for thirty years was in stock before the two thousand would have to begin existing on synthetic food pellets
the entrance into the cavern was a milelong tunnel from outer air at the base of everest
this had been blocked up against the future mighty tides by a solid seal of liquescent rock which hardened into a substance like gneiss
through the center of the milelong seal however had been left a oneinch hole this were lenses in sequence terminating in a fisheye lens that spread vision
a simple peephole arranged because the atmospheric disturbances caused by the moons approach made television impossible
talmadge addressed the shivering throng in the cavern
comrades earth as you know is about to pass into an epoch more violent than any it has suffered since it cooled enough for life to begin
during this violence we and our descendants hope to exist in here through flood and fire through the moons bursting and blanketing of earth through the ensuing glacial period nucleus may struggle up to a reborn world from this cave a thousand years from now a million perhaps never
but meanwhile we shall keep the spark of the race alive i hope
that was all and even that was superfluous
all knew why they were here and what faced them
the calm of catastrophe beyond mortal imagination to visualize held them
talmadge turned to the peephole
it was all very bewildering and incredible
there was no explanation for the suddenness with which it happened
all scientists had agreed that the mounting tides would rise gradually a little higher each day until at last all earth would be daily deluged
and all scientists were wrong
talmadge inventor of the atomdisrupter turned to that peephole to see for one thunderous instant a thing which was impossible but which was nevertheless occurring
instead of increasing in height gradually the moondragged tide had leaped within a few hours to within a half mile of what should be its eventual maximum
he had thought to see a dry vista from the mountains base had thought it would be weeks before the high plateau would feel its first ripples from the distant ocean
instead talmadge looked through the rock seal to see something that at first he thought was a great mountain chain newly formed about a quarter of a mile from the fisheye lens
then he saw that the mountain chain was composed of water was the first really great tidal wave
a sort of moan left his lips
mile high in spite of the altitude to which it had already climbed to reach here the wall of water rushed toward everest stunned eye saw great crests toppling from its highest ridge to be absorbed by the wall before they could cascade downward so great was that walls speed
he saw something like a tiny slug for an instant near the crest and realized it was a whale
he saw white specks on the ground microscopic in comparison with the tidal wave swallowed in a half second and realized that the lofty buildings of the new city of ebberhow on base had been destroyed as all things pertaining to humanity must have been destroyed along the tidal waves path
a wave a mile high
coming with incalculable speed and force
talmadge saw the solid wall rush seemingly upon his own defenseless person as it rushed for the far lens then saw nothing at all as the water struck the mountains base
comrades he cried turning from the peephole
the cataclysm is upon us
the first great wave has struck his voice was lost in the trembling and rumbling of the mountain as all of mighty everest quivered to the shock of that tremendous wall of water
but the people heard and tohiki with a despairing scream sprang to side
he was not quick enough almadge ordinarily would have seen his danger as quickly as the agilewitted tohiki
and god knows he knew enough of hydraulics to realize the incompressibility of water
but the magnitude of what he had seen stunned his brain and tohiki was not quick enough
at one instant talmadge stood with the back of his head next to the peephole and at the next instant head had disappeared
his body sank to the floor while over it from the peephole roared a oneinch stream of steam and water as straight and solid as a metal bar
the lenses pushed before the water column like glass bullets crashed to atoms against the opposite cavern wall ten miles away
the water column endured for five hundred yards before it feathered to nothingness
it grew in diameter to an inch and a half two inches three before the wave outside passed on and left a glistening drenched world to rear bared rocks to the air again
then the two thousand in retreat with their horrible panic allayed went to the body of their leader head had been sheared off almost as though with a knife as the lenses shrieked from the peephole
the flesh of his throat at the stubend was pulped almost to the consistency of whipped cream by the high velocity of the projectiles
a concerted moan came from the throng in the cave then shoulders were straightened with grim resolve and faces were turned resolutely toward one another
outside was a drowned and lifeless world one that would be so battered and drowned daily for thousands of years
inside their leader talmadge lay dead
but the protecting seal of his liquescent rock and the benificent products of his atomdisrupter lived on after him
the human race had a chance at salvation because of the work of his clear mind
i the late afternoon talgor the tall huddled into the protection of his vacuum suit and stared through the transparency of his oxygen helmet at the familiar landscape spreading from the vacuumwalled tower beneath him
he looked absently at a world as round and smooth as a gigantic billiard ball a world covered by thin topsoil on which grew patiently nothing but lichenous moss a world lit dimly by a darkred sun
time was according to the ancient fables when the sun had been virile and warm and bright
men did not have to walk abroad in vacuum suits to keep from freezing in the everlasting cold
many forms of vegetation and of animal life flourished
there had been mountains and valleys lakes and rivers and oceans
then according to the dim legends a great satellite whose name was lost in antiquity had fallen on earth
it had raised tides that raged for un counted centuries
the tides had smoothed down mountains and filled up depressions
the satellite had broken up shielding earth from the sun and water had frozen into a solid and uniform shell over the worlds smooth face
the countless fragments whirling around earth had gradually been pounded to dust by meteors am had vanished leaving the world again in the suns rays
but it was a dying sun now with little of its original heat
but before the great change legend had it that a handful of men and women had hidden from chaos in the bowels of earth under a lofty mountain
they had literally eaten rock tearing down the atoms of whatever material was around them and remaking them into lifes necessities
the handful had grown to hundreds of thousands and the small cave into which they had originally gone had become a vast underground kingdom
then they had emerged to the world as it now was to find that they were not the sole form of life still existing
another form had evolved across tne world from their mountain a form so alien and foreign so horrible talgor looked guiltily around and then hastily pressed the little switch which shielded his thoughts from the masters
almost since the memory of present men there had been in the transparent oxygen helmets they were forced to wear in thin atmosphere the familiar transmitter sending thought vibrations to the headpiece receivers of the masters
it was only a year ago that talgor had devised the sensitizor screen which shielded his thoughts from the transmitter
now he could keep his thoughts secret when they dwelt on them though he was aware that death would be his lot if they found it out
he went on with his bleak thoughts
during the chaos caused by the fall of nowforgotten satellite man had survived in his cave
across the world coldblooded life which man had called fish had also survived
most submarine life had been killed by the battering tidal waves just as air40 breathing creatures had been killed
but a few had found refuge in an underground ocean one could guess how many million years ago that had been
no one could theorize about the evolutionary course that gradually followed
all that could be said was that when man came forth from his underground empire the descendants of these coldblooded marine beings similarly emerged
they were still coldblooded able to freeze and thaw out again without harm
they still breathed oxygen from water their transparent helrrits contained water instead of air
but they walked on four paddlelike legs clothed their glistening and hairless bodies in vacuum suits and in their neverblinking lidless eyes shone intelligence
much intelligence
they were bigger than man in brain as well as bulk
men had stagnated underground
they had kept alive the atomic knovledge compiled by the nameless hero whose inventive genius had kept the race alive but had added no new knowledge
the coldblooded waterbreathing creatures had kept expanding in brain power
they became the masters with human beings as their slaves
talgor smiled bitterly
little enough use men were to the masters they were far ahead of men in thinking capacity their hardy physical points made them better fitted to survive in present bleakness
talgor had often thought that the masters allowed mankind to exist only because of hands
marvelous things hands
with them men and women the slaves could build machines more easily than could the masters with their annoying flippers
they could more easily manufacture the water the masters needed for their breathing for long ago all water lying normally on surface had evaporated
but regardless of the purpose the masters kept the race of mankind in a bondage none the less horrible for the fact that the great majority of human beings were not versed in the ancient legends and did not know the comparative servitude they were in
but talgor knew
he knew that men had once ruled earth
he knew that men should be superior to these cold and emotionless beings calling themselves masters
and he plotted for the return of day
he stirred in his vacuum suit and stared over the towers rim
below he saw several dozen small figures moving
they were friends secretly appointed to meet him here
he went down the towers core to meet them
a score of figures moved to join him as he emerged at the towers base
they were white colorless in a way inconceivable to mankind of a far earlier day
their hair was white their skins were white their eyes were white save for pale smudges of pupils
absolutely without color
talgor the tall towered among them
he was nearly four feet in height almost as big as the average master have your thought screens switched on he said swiftly and without preamble
all nodded soberly
they were moving on the edge of death meeting here conspiring against the masters and all knew it poignantly
you are ready to risk your lives to the end that the world be cleared of the masters and that human beings are supreme again
their white heads inclined a second time
you know to the full the bondage in which you are held know said one voice sounding broken and hoarse through the diaphragm in his helmet
my woman was taken last year for thinking against the masters
they took her helmet and vacuum suit from her and watched while she strangled and froze know said another short time ago the masters took my first child
i had allowed the third bank of atomrearrangers under my care to slow for a needed repair and they sought to punish me
they threw her a little girl into the rearrangers
i saw her disappear before my eyes
then they turned the heatcontrol to degrees and a ragged blob of codium appeared where my first child had been he others somberly added their tales of horror and oppression
the last concluded on a desperate note one which talgor however had sensed before
the masters are about to get rid of us i believe this man said
time and again one or more of us has gone mad and revolted
some of the masters have been killed
some of their machinery has been smashed
they have had several councils in which men are called unstable and a possible menace
they are holding one now
i believe that is their last council
talgor the tall nodded vith desperate calm
i believe you speak the truth
i believe the race of man is lost unless a weapon i have been working on for nearly a year can save it
that is inquired the oldest among the rest
you shall see
talgor led the way into the entrance through the thick vacuum wails of the tower
it was an ordinary supply tower one of the smaller and more remote of the hundred towers which were the scattered heart of all life in which were the latest and finest atomic machines
they were substantially the same as the one which had gone with the handful of human beings into the cavern far in the dim past when the satellite fell and broke
the unknown hero of that time had come close to the ultimate with his atomdisrupter it was possible to make few improvements
power was still obtained by borings toward core borings that pierced to the very center now
the nearest available substance was thrown into the disrupters to emerge after varied heat treatments as the various substances of life just as had been done in the cavern
talgor the tall led the vay to the boring in this particular tower
beside the nozzle of pure ardrium hardest of all known alloys was a squat bell of transparent substance within which could be seen numberless tubes topped by a circular grid of some metal none of the men had ever seen before
this is the weapon with which i hope to save mankind said talgor his eyes sternly proud as he stared at the bell
within this bell heat from the boring is converted to electrical energy which is in turn transformed back to radiant heat and stepped up in wave length almost to infinity by the tubes
the radiant heat is capable of passing through atmosphere and other transparent substances to expend its energy on whatever opaque body stops it up to a range of about ten miles
there its force is dissipated diminished by the square of the distance traveled
but i think the range will be sufficient
the others stared at him awed frightened hopeful but the masters vacuum suits objected one at last
they may be capable of insulating their bodies against even your radiant heat
talgor smiled bleakly their bodies may be shielded to some extent but not their heads
for they wear the transparent helmets just as we do and my radiant heat will pass through transparencies as it does through atmosphere diminished only by the square of the distance
you are sure began one of the rest timidly am sure of nothing said talgor have had no time to experiment properly
the masters moved too quickly for that
my weapon may kill them it may not
that is the chance we take
now you must go quickly
the masters will be here soon
the masters
here
yes
for the past few minutes i have had my thought screen switched off so that they could read my mind and learn of the plot against them here
i concealed only the manner of the weapon itself
within a few moments the masters will be here all of them save the very young and the infirm darting to crush me before i can menace their race he other men milled around the tower with frightened cries
for generations fear of the masters had been inbred in them
the knowledge that in a body they were coming here now maddened them with fear
leave the tower at once calm voice cracked out
prepare to kill all survivors of the masters race as soon as i have struck
prepare to lead mankind back to freedom
the men streamed all too willingly toward the entrance
but one said you talgor
what happens to you leave the tower instantly before it is too late
talgor interrupted with a break in his voice
what would happen to him
he knev only too well what would be his fate what must be the fate of any man within these walls when his radiant heat transmitter began to function
the others ran from the tower
from the soles of their metal boots appeared their gravity plates shielding mass from gravitational pull
they shot heavenward soared on stub wings slithering from the arms of their vacuum suits shot skyward again when altitude was lost in distance repeated the process skyhopping rapidly off to the east
and from the west the face of talgor the tall paled under his helmet
the sky to the west seemed to be darkening with a great cloud
only there had been no such thing as a cloud in the sky for a million years
this blackening was caused by the massed bodies of the masters every one capable of movement was rushing to tower because of the fragmentary thoughtthreat he had permitted them to receive
a menace to their race
this one mad human midge must be crushed then more leisurely the rest of the slave race that had lately grown annoying
talgor watched from the entrance
the up and down advance of the masters like waves of a great black sea rushed upon him
they towered up in a last ascent before swooping
he could see individual bodies now monstrous cylindrical bodies witft four stubby limbs heads with taring lidless eyes glaring out through waterfilled helmets
he leaped to the control of his heat transmitter
his thin white fingers clutched it
one touch of that ardrium lever and if his calculations were correct the human race was saved
it was as tremendously sublimely simple as that
but he himself the thin air outside the tower whistled and shrieked with the cleaving of thousands of stubby wings
talgor the tall pulled at the control for weeks along the equatorial belt where life was concentrated human beings under the leadership of the score who had been last to talk with talgor destroyed remaining vestiges of the monstrous race that had enslaved man for thousands of years
the old and the very young those who had been too distant to get to tower with the main body all the masters talgor had not annihilated
then with mankind once more enthroned on earth they erected a great statue to talgor where the tower had once been
had once been there was scant trace of the structure now
when talgor had pulled at the control the vacuum walls had blazed and melted allowing the radiant heat to smite full against the wheeling towering horde of masters
the heat had charred their heads then exploded their helmets as the water within was turned to steam
only blackened fragments strewed the burned earth for miles around all that was left of the last grave threat against humanitys existence
talgor
well there was no tower left no trace of its banked machines
there was nothing left where the tower had stood save a distorted transparent bell within which was fused metal
talgor had given his life horribly when he pulled that control
talgor was dead
but the human race lived on
out of the gale came cries of men fishermen blown to sea in sinking boat saved as mate checks strange light days and two nights we were out there drifting helpless in the gale and all the while we pumped to keep afloat write william neher of new york and warren brown of beverly mass and again wed sight a ship during the day but couldnot make them see us go on by leaving us to pump again and put off drowning a little longer
but the second night we figure our pumping is about over our hands are so svollen we can hardly grip the pump handle our backs ache like toothache and were beginning not to care much when way off come the pin points of steamer lights
for hours as those lights came nearer we signalled with our flashlight and when there was a chance of hearing us through the gale we yelled like wild indians
we owe our lives to third mate charles guy of this ship the tanker hansen of the sahine transportation co inc and to the fresh eveready batteries in our flashlight
for it was the light that attracted mr guy and made him change his course
soaked by the storm in use hour after hour those eveready batteries lived up to their reputation
if they hadnot wed be down now with davy jones
i the guarantees freshness national carbon co i east 42nd street new york a fresh a thats why theevereadv i the empty stratocar a sky glorious with flung streamers of scarlet and purple new leaping towers and arching aerial streetways traced a prismatic arabesque epitomizing the wonder and the beauty of the century
but don atkins his lithe compact body poised on bigthewed legs widespread and firmly planted was as oblivious to that faroff glory as to the bustle of the federal skyport all about him
he stood beneath the high loom of the landing trap squinting into the west out of slitted eyes from whose corners weather wrinkles rayed threadlike and he was conscious of only two things
under the yellow silk of his airmans tunic a small hard lump was cold against his breast
it was the uii ra mod ern sc ience ays to come a lever that connected to thomas helmet ey author of the lansotl screen the land where time stood still etc talisman o the silver eagle the throbbing pulse in his temples reminded him symbol of the gallant fellowship into whose fold he had been inducted at last
the secret that for months had lain prickling between him and his one close friend bart thomas was a secret no longer
bart himself darting from the distant pacific would be here in minutes now to receive from him the twisting handgrip of the order
in minutes in seconds now a siren howled across the field
a black speck notched the low suns upper rim
on time to the dot
atkins exclaimed
a white blur in the air was suddenly a silver teardrop shape caught in the highreaching fingers of the landing traps gaunt girders a thousand feet above him
the gigantic beam surged down pivoting on its huge hinge perilously fast at first then more and more slowly as is unieasiied when two powers clash 4i its hydraulic shockabsorbers sapped the stratocars incredible momentum
atkins dashed for the spot where the duraluminumskinned mancarrying projectile would ground to end thomas halfhour flight from frisco skyport
a knot of browngarbed mechanics clotted around the tiny car
their wrenches clanged against the boltheads that had clamped tight the hatch cover against the airlessness of upper space
twirling metal rasped against metal
the shining oval door swung back
with eager impatience atkins shoved past the mechanics thrust head and shoulders into the aperture
happy landing old sock he shouted
welcome to the greeting froze on his ups
the tiny cubicle was unoccupied was starkly staringly vacant
in the heatless light of the ceiling tube the teleview screen mirrored the skyport tarmac glimmered from the glossy leather of the cushion on which thomas should have lain outstretched
but thomas wasnot there atkins skin was a tight prickling sheath for his body
the thing was grotesquely weirdly impossible
impossible for his chum to have got out of the stratocar unless someone had unbolted the hatch from outside
impossible for it to have landed somewhere so that that might have been done
to have arrived on the dot of its schedule the stratocar must never have relented from the uttermost limit of its speed
time lost in any halt could not have been made up
impossible for there to have been any halt the device was propelled by the blast of an electrostatic catapult at its starting point and had no power of its own
once stopped it could not have taken up its flight again
and it had come straight as an arrow to the hooks at which frisco had aimed it
a fleck of white on the cushion caught atkins eye
he reached in snatched it up
it was a bit of paper and on it mr atkins a peremptory voice battered at his giddy brain conceal that and bring it to me at once
the airman thrust the scrap into his pocket whirled
the groundmen were crowding in around him their swart countenances curious but it was evident that none of them had spoken
then he recalled the tiny receiver clamped against the bone behind his ear and he knew whence the summons had come
this device hasnot been perfected yet the grey man in the hidden room had said but within tne limits of the field i can speak to you through it secretly and at will
there had been a viewscreen before him too whose cosmicray eye could scan anything within fifty miles
close it up don atkins snapped and say nothing to anybody
then he was running across the long level tarmac was dashing up the broad steps of flight headquarters building was hurrying through the interminable maze of corridors within
the chaos within his skull took on a pattern as the amazing revelations of his initiation came back to him
the nation dreamed itself at peace with all the world
the asafrican alliance americans fatuously thought having driven out the white races from the continents they had so long dominated wanted nothing but to be left alone hey reckoned without the driving ambition of hungchen the new genghis khan who had forged an irresistible war machine behind the inscrutable mask of the east and awaited the auspicious moment to launch it against the occident and the americas
if he could not be stopped war rapine slaughter must inevitably destroy the golden age to which civilization had at last attained
but here was the wallpanel in a guarded corridor whose curious quality he had been taught less than an hour before
atkins halted glanced cautiously left and right
he was unobserved
he bent to get his lips close against a certain whorl in the blue tracings with which the marble was figured whispered a password
a whirring sound seeming to come from the very stone itself told him that the impact of his voice had set in motion the soundlock within
the apparently solid marble slid open and the airman went through
the wall thudded shut behind him
in the windowless room he entered a short gravefaced man mouselike in grey silk looked up from his desk
let me see what you found he said without preamble
atkins fumbled in his pocket with shaking fingers pushed the paper across the desk to the chief of the silver eagle
the red lines on it leered at him again the ominous design that had pronged him with knowledge of the catastrophe that had overtaken thomas
a deftly drawn dragon was coiled around the orb of earth one taloned claw sprawling triumphantly to obliterate the double triangles of the americas
the chiefs grey face was almost expressionless as he touched the thing with a fingertip but under his pale inscrutable eyes little muscles twitched uncontrollably
the token of hungchen he said
like him to let us know that hes defeated our last device against his spies
what does it mean
atkins groaned mental agony making him forget rank for the moment
what does it mean
the others tones were very calm only the vaguest flatting betrayed the despair that must be closing in on him like a pall
it means that the key to the gaps in the west coast electrobarrage is in his hands the only thing he needed to enable him to strike
thomas was bringing the plan to army headquarters and hes got thomas
but but you said that the silver eagle memorizes all its messages
you said that spies had tapped every means of secret communication weve had and thats why the sliver eagle was organized correct
we thought that a band of glorified couriers shot across the continent at a speed greater than any yet known would circumvent him
but weve failed
this lets us know that we have failed
they will get it out of thomas no
atkins fist pounded down on the desk
bart will never tell die before he tells
he wonot die until they know strip his brain the chief broke off
but that may take time
if we can find him before he ripped a long tape from a machine on his desk
a straignt purple line traced on it wavered at a single point
look here
this deflection in the flightgraph shows that an extra amount of power was being absorbed between three minutes twelve seconds out of frisco and seven minutes fortysix seconds after the start
i noticed it and thought that the projectile had svierved slightly from its course was taking additional energy to straighten it out
but it occurs to me what sir
atkins demanded excitedly
what that something may have come into the field there betveen three hundred and twenty and seven hundred and seventy miles from the pacific on the great circle course
we might look that region over going sir
grey eyes stabbed keenly at the trembling airman new atkins
i donot know bart thomas is my friend
chief
more than a brother very well the grey man made his decision
you may go
and god help you if you are caught
listen the kapparay a light from traffic trol flashed the all clear signal and atkins thrust his throttle home
his gyrocopter leaped straight up from the fields shot up through the night past the successive glows of the level markers
the red of the lumbering freighterlane the yellow of the localflight zone the cerulean blue of the level in which the great transoceanic liners plied cometlike they surged past in his viewscreen dropped below
sunburst came to him from over the bulge of the rounding terrain as his ceptor staggered logily
its roaring vanes could no longer find any support in the near vacuum of the stratosphere
atkins twisted the controls
the liftingvanes collapsed into their slotted grooves
the flyer was a sleek silver fish from whose tail the crimson flame of rocket gases fanned out
it darted westward silent and swift as a bat out of hell
atkins throttled down reluctant but obedient to the chiefs instructions
he must not overtake the sun darkness would be his best aid
two red spots burned bright on his cheeks and secret fires flickered in his glowing eyes coming old man he muttered between his teeth coming bart
stick to it give in tell them endlessly blurred earth streaked underneath him endlessly the red position dot drifted with nerveshredding slowness across the map framed at the flyers elbow
he shut off the feed unfolded once more the gyrovanes
he drifted down through the darkness silent as a cloud in a foggy night as invisible
a rugged mountainside forestcloaked swam up into dim view
atkins checked the descent hovered
a twist of his wrist and the beam of his kapparay projector was searching the serried carpet of the trees
to the unaided eye that beam was utterly imperceptible but on the specially treated screen at wnich the airman peered avidly a flickering disc cut through imaged foliage through dark underbrush
to the kapparay all organic matter is transparent only earth stone or metal can reflect it and become visible
minutes dragged
bare ground only bare ground netted by branching streamlets
then what was that
atkins held the ray steady quivering with bowstring tenseness
an irregular cube of stone showed mistily
a house
a human habitation in the wilderness
his heart bumped crazily against his ribs
but wait a minute it might be a ranger station a depot of the men who patrolled this primeval forest that was preserved as a national park
beyond the house a metal something huge curiously formed bulked vaguely
atkins pulse leaped
he had found that which he sought
thomas captors thought themselves well hidden beneath the leafy screen
evidently the kapparay was one secret that had been successfully kept from them still don atkins dropped until he was a bare hundred feet above the treetops
too bad his search beam could not reveal human forms
he dared not send the map coordinates of this place by radio
he would be overheard the gang would be warned and escape
but at full power it would take him seven minutes to reach frisco skyport
then a hundred pursuit rockets would leap into the air
in minutes the mountain could be surrounded by wellarmed men
he reached for the throttle
the sea of foliage almost black in the long evening shadows glowed suddenly into green flame
just above the strange building an orange pinpoint leaped into existence
an inverted cone of radiance soared lightningswift from that focal point
instantly the copter was bathed in the flare
intolerable heat struck at atkins
the steel walls about him flamed cherryred
he was frying in the torrid blast
already his senses were leaving him with despairing instinct he thrust at the release lever of the emergency hatch beneath his seat no time to snatch at the parachute cone
he was falling falling lifted slowly back to consciousness
his body was seared with pain
an iron band constricted his chest and his blood was salty warm on his lips
a black silence enveloped him broken by vague rustlings and the sound of trickling water
his dazed eyes adjusted themselves to the dimness and he saw twisted tree branches moonlight sifting through leaves all about him
he was lying across a sturdy gnarled bough
above him he could make out broken branches a funneled path torn through thick interlacing foliage
slowly it dawned on him what occurred
plunging down he had struck the lofty crown of some forest giant
the smaller branches the massed verdure at the top of the tree had absorbed the force of his fall
this larger branch had caught and held him had kept him from crashing through to the ground
he had failed miserably
the realization wrenched a groan from him
suddenly he tensed clinging tightly to his bough listening acutely
a voice sounded
heavy bodies threshed through the underbrush
a yellow glow flickered among the trees below and was gone
it came again held steady as it grew brighter
two bulking shadows appeared forcing through the thick growth
the dim backthrow of a lantern beat against the dull green of a uniform familiar to atkins from hunting and fishing expeditions in these very woods
this was luck
their post could not be far off with its radiophone chance a coded message to the chief
his throat tightened to a cautious call the lanternbearer stumbled ripped out an oath
it was not in english
his light found his face
high cheekbones thick lips narrow slanted eyes
they were orientals
they were searching for something
of course it was he for whom they were looking his body
they wanted to make sure of his death make sure that his crumpled form lying perhaps near a trail would not betray their hiding place
the lantern glow flashed dartingly along the ground into the treetops
atkins tried to make himself a part of the limb
rough bark rasped a deep wound in his palm
he flinched uncontrollably lost his grip
he was slipping was falling a desperate tightening of his gripping knees a flexing of his aching arm muscles stopped the disastrous fall
but the leaves still rustled with his movements
a sharp challenge ripped the forest silence
a tube in the yellow hand of one of the searchers spurted blue flame
it shot through the leaves and its heat the acrid smoke of seared greenery stung atkins nostrils
a second bolt came still nearer
even if they missed him the light of those raytube flashes must reveal him to the hunters
cut it out mingai the other voice rasped in english nothing but a wildcat or some othei animal do not think so
i do not like that we have not found the body of the flyer
forget it
he was burned up in the ray
the orange ray does not slay
it merely accelerates the electronic vibration of metallic atoms until the melting point is reached
but i forget you would not understand
you are as stupid about scientific matters as the americans among whom you have been raised
you even speak their barbarous tongue better than the language of your ancestors
you give me a pain
come on lets get back tell fukong to do his own dirty work brave you are when he cannot hear you mingai sneered
but in his presence you cringe and are meek like the rest of us
no friend lisan we do not return as yet
all right if youre going to be that way look further
not till i discover what there is in this tree
hope died in atkins brain
going to keep on raying till were spotted by some snooping ranger
no there is a better way
mingai turned back to the tree
his cylinder again jetted its blue flame
it was continuous now was boring across the trunk
back and forth the steady yellow hand drew the disintegrating beam
the great bole quiv50 ered started to sway
atkins got his feet beneath him on the perch leaped down
his aim was true
his heavy boots struck square on shoulder
he felt bone crack beneath the impact of his weight
even as the man dropped the american jumped sideward catlike his lithe form twisting in midair so that he faced the other oriental
he caught a fleeting glimpse of a startled countenance then the saffron face was obliterated by the crashing thud of his fist
he whirled away hurtled into the shadowed brush
thorned tendrils caught and tore at atkins
a root tripped him and he crashed headlong into a tree trunk
he thudded to the ground lay there his tortured lungs laboring his outstretched hands plucking at the earthy loam
from behind atkins heard a thin whistle shrill almost above the range of human hearing
from far to his right another responding
evidently the men from whom he had escaped were signalling for aid
he struggled erect
he was unarmed alone bruised and battered terribly fatigued
but he knew now that he could escape by working down the hill to his left
in the other direction were desperate men weapons at their ruthless command that could whiff him into eternity at will
he turned to the right
pursuit squadron crouched in the shelter of a bush
before him the stone structure he had seen from the air loomed blackly
over the clearing a rope network carried a camouflage of tree branches that his kapparay had pierced
he could hear a murmur of voices but the sounds came from beyond or within the squat building
on the side toward him there was silence and nothing moved
the darkness of the wall he faced was relieved by a horizontal line a thread of light almost imperceptible
the eyes clung to it
then he was crawling across the bare ground that lay between
twenty feet of shelterless surface flecked with the revealing light of the moon
could he make it unobserved
inch by crawling inch every muscle every nerve taut with expectation of a sudden hail of a blue flash that would sear him into nothingness atkins slid toward the beckoning line of light
after an eternity he was in the solid shadow of the wall
he raised himself cautiously and found the place where the light shone through
it was the lower edge of a steelshuttered window just at the level of his eyes
he could not see much of the room within the aperture was a mere slit
but what he saw was enough
just within range of his vision was a tabletop black and glistening like glass
fastened to its surface leather straps cutting deep into the flesh of his arms and legs was thomas
his friends stocky body was stark naked
in a cold lurid light that beat down atkins could see his knotted muscles writhe snakelike the sweat of agony gleaming on his skin
thomas face was deathly white his clenched teeth were revealed by lips that curved away his eyes were closed and his cheek muscles were quivering
his forehead his hair were covered by a metal helmet from which wires curled away out of sight
a low mechanical hum rose steadily in pitch
bart thomas form arched slowly up from the table straining against its creaking bonds
suddenly the hum stopped and the twisted body slumped flaccidly inertly down
a yellow hand slim its long fingers ending in pointed nails came into view holding a small sponge to thomas nostrils
the prisoner quivered his eyes opened and atkins fists clenched as he read the despair that stared from them
he heard a voice suavely cruel
it is very painful this searching of your brain
if you chose to talk you would save yourself much anguish
atkins scalp was a tight cap for his skull as the bound mans eyelids dropped and lifted again
even speech seemed too great an effort for him but his lips moved
a hand was clamped over atkins mouth a powerful arm wound around him from behind pinning his own arms to his sides
he was lifted from the ground
he drove a desperate heel backward into a hard shin
something crashed against the back of his head and he hung dazed and barely conscious in huge arms that carried his hundred and fifty pounds as though he were a child
the room whirled dizzily about don atkins
he saw men a television screen a black tube that rose through the ceiling from some unknown device
he was carried through another door and a saffronhued face lengthened by a wisp of grey beard and drooping mustachios under a hawk nose drifted hazily before him
only the eyes were clear black eyes piercing behind their slanted lids
atkins was set down in a chair
hands fumbled at him passed a rope around him binding him to his seat
he scarcely noted it spellbound by those glittering eyes
his fogged brain cleared a bit and he saw a tall oriental imperturbable
there were banked tubes glowing behind him and bright copper coils
to one side a table its black top glistening like glass
thomas strapped down was looking at him with eyes in which incredulity and horror flared
the tall oriental spoke
who is this nagarri rom behind don a huge black came in view
dressed like the others of the gang in the olivegreen of the rangers he was still redolent of the jungle
his skin was a deep dull black that swallowed light
his bullet head sat queerly on wide shoulders from which arms thick as saplings hung loosely almost to his knees his voice was a throaty rumble donot know
lord fukong
but the electriceye alarm he flash and i find this one peeking in
so i bring him to you
maybe he the one who we bring down from the plane the one who jump on mingai and lisan
the other nodded
probably
he seems very persistent to atkins you display a great deal of interest in our proceedings
i hope you are satisfied with your present opportunity to observe them
he reached out a clawlike hand and ripped away the front of the airmans shirt
he snatched at the token hanging there
the fine gold chain snapped and he had it in his hand
a faint smile crossed the jaundiced mask of his face and he held the tiny bird out to the black
not a half inch long it was but exquisitely wrought
an eagle poised as if in flight it seemed almost alive
see nagarri this is another of the brood
they wear talismen about their necks like your own tribesmen to bring them good luck
but i fear the dragon of hungchen is too strong for their puny godlet
he turned back to the american shall deal with you in a moment when i have finished vith your comrade
watch closely american and i wish you joy of what you see
now he was talking to thomas and his voice was a crawling threat
have you decided to answer my questions
no
thomas voice was a tortured whisper but his lips closed tight and firm
fear and despair drew haggard lines across his face
fukong shrugged stepped to the wall where a tall slate panel glittered with switchpoints gages gleaming ebony wheels
still stubborn
you will not believe me then that this searcher will delve deeper and deeper into the core of your brain till it wrenches the uttermost secrets of your ego from you
yet it was an american who first proved that thought is an electric process who first measured the tiny currents that flow along the nerves
well if you must have it his fingers closed on a lever just above binding posts to which the wires trailing from the helmet on thomas head trailed
now fukong
fukong a shrill cry from the outer rooiti stopped him
another plane has appeared above
atkins forced his head around
mingai was in the doorway his shoulder bandaged his right arm in a sling
well why burst in on me like this
fukong was imperturbable
send someone to dispose of the remains
the others face was a sickly green
but it got away he gasped
it got away
the phrase was like the purr of an enraged cat
yes
my broken arm i had to use my left i missed with the orange ray and before i could aim again he was out of range voice trailed away in an apologetic murmur
you the other began fury breaking through the stony mask of his face
but again there was an interruption
a sallow hindu appeared
master the plane that escaped is signalling to frisco skyport and their rocket squadron is taking off
the chief had not failed them
he had sent a following plane that by great good luck had escaped the asiatics lethal ray
atkins calculated hastily
in ten minutes now this nest would be surrounded the spies captured thomas freed and his secret safe
fnkong was snapping peremptory orders
mingai and the hindu had disappeared nagarri was unstrapping thomas was carrying him out
the oriental leader himself raytube in hand was unfastening the rope that bound atkins
get up and precede me
the spy gestured with his weapon
the american obeyed staggering on limbs that were needling with returning blood
he was through the outer room his captor close behind him was in the open
straight ahead loomed a monstrous metal shape
eggshaped it was save for one end that was sliced off sharply and there was an opening manhigh in its side was just vanishing within with his burden
atkins followed clanged shut the slide behind him
a steel ladder mounted through a dim green light curving over an inner shell
atkins head came through a trapdoor above and he was in a low long chamber
then he was once more tightly bound
a rough shove from the black sent him sliding across the floor to thud against thomas trussed and naked form
lisan was just closing the trapdoor
mingai fear in his eyes was thrusting up on a valvehandle that projected from a large vertical pipe in the wall
at the far end before a large viewscreen the hindu was seated black discs of phone receivers clamped to his ears
beside him bent over a serried row of gages and levers atop a metal console
a large viewscreen before him showed the forestbordered clearing and the stone building that had been vacated in such haste
fukong pushed at a lever and the viewscreen was a flare of flame
it cleared
where the house had been was a gaping hole in the ground hand moved again
the screen was a downrushing blur
it cleared once more starstrewn the night sky was about them and the farbelow forest was a dark mysterious sea
don old man the whispering voice in his ear was thomas how on earth did you ever get into this mess came to find you atkins said grimly
and i did
how are you
pretty rocky
but keep until fukong gets a chance to work on me again canot understand how he ever got hold of you
your carrier came in right to the dot
what happened was zipping along watching the shoot past in the screen when suddenly something flashed over me and dropped down in front
shot over you
i thought the rocketstratocars were the fastest things ever produced
so did until i saw this craft bet it can make three hundred miles a minute
it passed me as if i were standing still
at any rate there it was right ahead of me and slowing
the blunt end was toward me and i thought sure i was going to crash into it
no way to swerve those carriers you know
but just as i reached it a hole opened and i sailed right inside
good lord
then its a sort of flying trap
damned ingenious eh
i can figure out the rest of it now
you say the stratocar reached new york on time
that means they closed the stern and speeded up again till they were making just the rate i was
afterward they went faster once more got clear of my boat and dropped away
they had just picked me out of it on the fly
i knew at the time was that my hatch opened and the big black was pointing a raygun at me
he told me to get out and i got were in an airlock and there was a rope ladder hanging down
i climbed it and found myself in this room was here and the hindu
then in a little while we were down in the clearing where the others were waiting
after that my troubles really began look at the screen be said sharply
atkins twisted himself back to his original position
in the distance a score of scarlet lights made a dancing crescent on the viewscreen
they rose and fell but came on steadily
he thrilled at the sight
these were the army flyers from frisco skyport
no mistaking that formation
those farspreading wings would sweep around as the center checked and the asafrican craft would be caught in an enfilading fire
fukong and his gang were doomed
peculiar how calmly they were taking it
eastern fatalism he supposed
eastern fatalism hell
memory fanged him
thomas had just told of the incredible speed at command
the spy master was not trapped far from it
he could get away at will
why was he hanging here motionless watching those oncoming flyers a sardonic smile tinging his yellow face
nearer and nearer the lights came
the dim shapes of the army rocketplanes showed phantomlike
the central ship dipped minutely and the long line began to expand
the motley crew of the spy ship clustered behind their leader in the bow
near enough voice rang like a sentence of doom
a long pencil of orange light shot out from his vessel wavered impinged on the nearest plane
the flyer flared red then dazzling white at the tip of the beam
then there was nothing there
the death ray moved on to the next in line
all along that farflung line a coruscation of green swept as the indomitable fighters shot out their futile answer
lethal enough those rays but their range was far short
another plane was caught in the orange beam and vanished another
but the squadron came on their milelong firetails lashing them through the night
if one only one could get near enough to spear the asafrican craft with its beam
taking that one desperate chance the birdmen rushed into the face of destruction never faltering never wavering as ship by ship the orange scythe reaped its deadl3 harvest
only ten ships were left of the score that had first appeared only nine and still the green rays were miles short of their mark
minutes passed that were long as eternity
eight of the intrepid attackers remained then seven
but now the stabbing darts of emerald death were almost reaching their mark
a little more only a little more
suddenly the floor vibrated and atkins heard the muted thunder of the crafts rocket blasts
the spy ship was moving at last
fukong would escape that vas unavoidable
the terrific speed of his strange vessel could never be matched by the combination of the americans
but at least the pitiful handful remaining would escape the holocaust
seeing the futility of their courageous attempt they would return to their base perhaps eifectuate plans for a countrywide encircling movement that might in the long run bring the yellow ship dovn
no atkins mouth twisted in a boundless oath the oriental had no intention of permitting that
the distance between the spycraft and the nearest attacker did not increase
the asiatic was keeping just beyond the range of the green rays was taking toll on the american aviators with false hope while the merciless orange beam flared out mowing the velvet night with destruction
the dragon of hungcben of the twenty flyers who had soared to the attack a bare still charged on
they were insane
they win but couldnot they
atkins stifled a gasp was taut with sudden hope
five of the squadrons remnant had startlingly changed their tactics
they were zigzagging were darting left and right up and down in what seemed a last panicky attempt to evade the ray
senseless it seemed but there was one ship that had left the group
its green ray was doused only the pinpoint red of its tailflame betrayed its course to atkins
he flung out his soul in a wordless prayer that neither fukong nor his aides would notice that stealthy climb
steadily the squadron leader mounted till the scarlet dot that marked him out was touching the upper margin of the viewscreen
ten thousand feet below his comrades flitted about in their macabre dance cheating the orange death again and again by breathless inches
the attention of the enemy crew was concentrated on those darting shapes on their darting ineffective rays
atkins eyes flicked back to the lone flyer
he saw the sudden crimson burst saw the dovmward curve of its flaring wake as a terrific swoop began saw the green ray dart out ahead spearhead of the diving hawk
down and down and down adding the pull of earth to his own driving blasts the avenger plunged in one last magnificent effort to catch the destroyer unaware zipping faster and faster until even in that tenuous air the steel planebody glowed dull red with the friction of its unleashed speed
a minutes grace sixty unobserved seconds of that lightning slant and it would snip the yellow menace from the skies
look fukong look
it was mingai who yelped the alarm
the orange ray swept up
jammed by luck by the luck with which the gods award the greatly daring the downdarting american had found the one vulnerable angle of the spy ship
green flame licked out hungrily but hand was lightquick in its flash to the throttle lever
his ship lurched jerked aside in the last possible moment of safety
the american was under now right under the spycraft
but the dragon ship was driving ahead
in an eyeblink fukong would be able to bring his death ray to bear on the daring flyer don atkins flung heavily across the floor by the sudden jerk saw not quite three feet above him a gleaming copper handle the valve at which mingai had twisted just before the takeoff
legs lashed arms bound sweat pouring from his lined brow eyes bulging from their sockets by sheer power of stomach and trunk muscles alone he swung his torso from the floor
his head came level with that handle
his teeth clamped around it
corded sinews stood out on his neck as he drove the valve lever down
suddenly he was snatched loose by a lurch of the craft and his preposterously twisted body crashed down
but that very lurch told him of success
it was the main fuelvalve
he had cut off the supply
in an instant now the vessel would be caught in the raybeam of the pilot below
atkins tensed to meet the green flash that would mean oblivion for fukong and his myrmidons and for bart thomas and himself
it never came
a shrill highpitched oath footsteps running toward him pulled open his eyes was bending over him face livid with wrath raygun rising for the eoup de grace
behind him lisan came up a strange glow between his slant lids
atkins eyes flicked past the couple
in this final moment o life he must know what had happened why his intended sacrifice had failed
a electric veil shimmering and sparking in a cerulean network of tiny lightnings curved ail across the viewscreen
beyond it the misty shapes of the attacking aircraft spat their green beams
the emerald death rays spattered harmlessly on the ionic curtain and were quenched
from within the orange ray thrust futilely against the hollow defensive sphere of force
this atkins saw in a single flashing glance
then he was staring up at the enraged oriental was waiting in a timeless void for the blue spurt that would sear thought and consciousness and life itself from his despairing brain
wait master lisan snatched at hand swerved it aside from its aim
wait
that way is too easy for the paleskinned dog
let me and mingai take care of him have a debt to pay for vhat he did to us in the wood in the others slitted eyes a glint of satisfaction showed had my doubts of you lisan
twice you have shown deplorable softness in your tasks
this i like much better
you may have your wish
but take him below i have much to do and do not wish to be disturbed atkins skin crawled
death he could face calmly but that which the fanatic gleam in saffron mask promised made him a coward
fukong he croaked barely able to force the words through his constricted throat give me to him
kill me yourself
that would be clean and honest
but the oriental was walking away
they took him down through the trapdoor carried him down flung him heavily on the plates in the narrow space between the entrance hatch and the curving inner shell
untie him mingai
there was an undercurrent of eager excitement in tones
even in the face of what was to come atkins wondered at the gratuitous cruelty of the oriental mind
mingai stooped to him fumbled at his lashings
as they fell away the american leaped up to make a fight of it
hopeless of course had his raygun poised for action
better to go out that way than to suffer the planned revenge of the sadistic duo
now hands up mingai
quick
the virulent threat in voice made the low command seem a crashing shout
mingai straightened
his arms flew above a saffron face from which amazement and horror had stripped its habitual mask
lisan was braced on spread feet his raygun thrust before him
his countenance was alight with a strange flame and his eyes snapped menace
one whimper from you and i flash
there was an instant of stunned silence
then lisan spoke again
here you grab those ropes
tie him up and gag him
quick man
dazed by the sudden turn atkins obeyed lay behind this sudden act on the part
had he suffered a sudden change of heart he recalled in the wood lisan trying to argue mingai out of his determination to search the tree in which he was hiding
he recalled inter56 vention with fukong a moment ago that had certainly saved his life his task was finished mingai tightly bound and a strip from his own tunic jammed none too gently into his mouth
before atkins could his questions there was a sudden dull roar which shook the vessel getting under way again barked no time to lose
he plucked raygun from his belt thrust it into the hand
come on
he was flitting silently up the ladder atkins perforce after him hey were just beneath the rivetstudded trap
lisan lifted the lid slowly till a narrow crack of brighter light showed along its edge
atkins managed to crush in alongside of him on the narrow step and together they peered through the slit
the blue defensive sphere was gone and the attacking ships had vanished
but something else showed in the sky a long slim torpedolike object that sped straight for the spy ship
from its nose a white light flickered in a rapid series of dots and dashes
atkins felt an electric quiver of tenseness run through the yellow man against whose body his own was crushed
a strange pattern formed itself in the mind as he crouched there waiting for he know not what
that oncoming shape had the very form of the rocketstratocars used by the silver eagle
yet this was no messenger waylaid as thomas had been
he had signalled to fukong
why had the spycraft waited here chancing the fight with the american planes when it might have been away and gone with only the slightest effort
what was it that glowed from eyes that shook him with an ague of eagerness
nearer came the speeding rocket and nearer still until it passed out of sight at the lower edge of the viewscreen
the larger craft lurched and lurched again
fukong thrust at his levers there was a hiss of rushing air
then a buzzer shrilled picking up the stratocar whispered
get ready
all right nagarri fukong called
the air in the entrance lock is at normal pressure
open up
the black bent to a ring in the center of the floor and pulled on it
a round manhole lid came away
a head appeared and a squat broad body followed it
straight black hair tiny black eyes almost hidden by high cheekbones broad flat nose over thick red lips this was a tatar face a throwback to the mongol hordes that in the thirteenth century ruled half the thenknown world by force of arms
from that stocky figure emanated an aura of power of dominance
unbounded ambition lust for power savage cruelty were stamped on the round flaccid countenance
lisan clutched atkins arm his fingers sinking into the flesh
hungchen
come himself to receive reports
tomorrow the attack
atkins understood why the spymaster had been unable to flee
he had had to wait here for his chief no way to change the course of the stratocar once it had started
the huge black bowed low
the hindu joined him in humble obeisance
the haughty fukong came away from his controls abject servility in every line of his tall body
the mongol spoke sharply and there was a rapid exchange in a shrill highpiping tongue
now
the snapped word from galvanized atkins into action
he thrust upon the hatch leaped clang
the yellow men swung to the sound of the falling trapdoor saw tvo apparitions spring into view rayguns at the ready
throw up your hands
up viith them
atkins shout drove through the chamber
up or we wipe you out eyes were blazing pits of wrath simian arms went ceilingward the fukong ripped out a virulent traitor at lisan and snatched at the cylinder in his belt
blue lightning hissed from atkins weapon
a blackened corpse crumpled slowly to the floor any more
his voice was thick with fury
but the remaining three stood statuelike
we surrender came the voice of the captured overlord flash heir captives tightly bound the two don atkins the american and lisan the chinese turned to one another
atkins hand went out to the other then hesitated drew back
lisan straightened
no he answered the question in the eyes am not a traitor to my own people
here his hand tapped his own breast there are two loyalties one to the race among whom i was born among whom i have lived my life and have my friends the other to the race of my ancestors
war between them vas unthinkable to me
he glanced down at bound and glowering looked up again a wdstful smile hovering on his saffron face
now there will be no war sorry i couldnot save the squadron of planes
i had to wait until he arrived you see
and it was too dangerous before to attempt to capture the ship
you joined their rotten gang risked death and worse to defeat their plans to save your own people and mine from the horrors of var
atkins exclaimed
by god lisan you are a man
yellow hand and white met and clasped
hey you fellows came bart thomas weak voice from the floor
when you get time you might take three or four of these ropes off me and get me something to wear get all the handshaking you want when we get back to new york

a beam of light was reflected from one of the sides of a revolving twelvesided block each side of which was a mirror itself
this made successive flashes of light
these rays were sent a long distance about a mile and were reflected back again from a mirror
the distance the twelvesided or faceted mirror moved in the time it took the flash to go to the other mirror and return was the basis for figuring the speed of light here is proof of the possibility of life upon other planets
professor charles lipman of the university of california claims to have recently discovered living microscopic organisms in meteorites which have flashed across the ether to earth from other planets
the interior of the meteorite the professor explained remained cool while the outside burst into flaming fragments yes that are grey brown or black are so colored because the iris contains a pigment of that tint
in the case of blue eyes however the outer layer of the iris is colorless and transparent
the inner layer is exposed
this is white and reflects and scatters the light which strikes it
the blue rays of light being the shortest are scattered most readily
in consequence the iris which is really white appears blue
the blueness of eyes is similar to that of the sky the latter also being caused by the scattering of blue light by the upper atmosphere

the real cause man will never know
a a group of eminent scientists and engineers once made an error in mathematics which altered the whole science of electricity
in a congress of engineers and physicists from all over the world convened for the purpose of establishing definitely and permanently the sizes of the various electrical units ohm farad etc for there was much confusion in this matter
it was finally decided to make the abampere the absolute or physicists unit of current exactly equivalent to the ampere the practical or engineers unit of current
on this basis the relative magnitudes of the other electrical units in each of the two systems absolute and practical were to be determined some undetected error in arithmetic the abampere was made equal to onetenth of an ampere and not equal to a whole ampere asthe congress had decided
as a result of this error the relative values of all the electrical systems in the two systems are different from vhat the congress set out to make them
whereas the scientists wished to make an abcoulomb equal a coulomb the latter is instead ten times the former
and so on and on
this error which was never corrected thus altered the entire science of electricity
a he number seems to have some special significance in our solar system
the diameter of the sun is times that of the earth
the distance from our planet to the sun is times the latters diameter
and the distance from earth to the moon is times the diameter of luna cience can now bend light
previously except for the great spacecurvatures vhich relativists say surround stars and suns no conceivable agency or material could actually cause light to travel in a curve
this feat was accompished by dr harry robert dittmar of the du pont research laboratories with the aid of pontalite a new plastic known chemically as methyl methacrylate polymer
du pont scientists recently demonstrated that a pretzelshaped length of pontalite could conduct light carry it around bends as a cable carries electricity
a flashlight was held close to one end of the twisted plastic tube
the other end of the tube shone brightly
the reason why pontalite bends light is because of the crystalline structure of the material which refracts the light in a series of very straight lines joined at slight angles like bar links in a watch chain so that the light stays inside the conductor until it reaches the end on the in the hygienic age of the future harold faddley aged commits a crime supreme
by he hard irregular shape of the selfadjusting nibbler moved over the grassland like a gigantic mechanical cow only it had caterpiller traction bands instead of legs
its thirtytwo jaws working alternately in echelons of eight opened shut nipped tore rhythmically
professor obinson had well remembered the importance of achieving conditions as identical as possible with those produced by the teeth and jaw action of herbivorous animals before the fodder went into the metabolisers
farmer geary watched the nibbler at work
he saw beyond it the vast threestoried acreages of his multiplecrop flats incongruously tilted on the side of durdleberry slopes in the distance
the bizarre shadow of the combined windsuncatcher like a spray of tulips mounted fanwise on a rotating mast slanted across the meadow
this is good said geary rubbing his hands
this is fine
he had been reading through his accountants estimate of balance and saw every prospect of being nearly ten per cent up on the previous half year
his soya byproducts his fibrous residues and his metaboliser it looked like a gigantic mechanical cow fodder all showed a most healthy increase
indeed the only slight setback had been in the thirdtier chlorophyl crops from the flats and this had been due solely to a mechanics unaccountable error in setting the thermostats
well he would settle this mechanic
mason it was
he had already appealed to the commission claiming for the loss to be made good
this would probably reduce superannuation prospects to those of the third class unless he made good in the next year or two by earning maxima efficiency bonuses
so farmer geary had every reason to feel pleased with himself as he returned to the gleaming farmhouse
he found the portrals there and old faddley and his wife and young tim on vacation from the university of agriculture
they had been talking about old times and new as people will in all ages
the greatest blessing of all mrs portral was saying as farmer geary stepped in from the lawn well its hard to say
i remember when i was a girl my mother used to tell me about how she used to mix foods together and put them into pots and ovens instead of just heating the carton
she said that it was a full days work doing all that unnecessary mixing and cooking and cleaning plates and dishes afterward
fancy having to use plates and dishes over and over again have been really hygienic agreed tim
but then the twentyfirst century was never much in advance of the tenth in the business of feeding think that the greatest blessing has been the abolition of edible animals said farmer geary adjusting a recliner and settling himself at the most comfortable angles
imagine the horrible animal smells and the dirt the sweating skins and be coarse elbert mrs vating mouths the flies
geary said
well been to outlandish countries where they still have such awful habits havenot it nearly made me sick to see the way they depended on vegetation being transmuted through the filthy stomachs of animals for meat and milk
blessings give my unhesitating vote to synthetic metabolising plant every time
harold here remembers cows and sheep in this country said mrs faddley you harold and geary shuddered
sure
when i was a boy near a hundred and thirty year ago i worked on one of the last of the old farms agreed old faddley
but i was used to it you see and i loved the smells of the farmyard and the lowing of the cows and the simple nature in it all why in the egglayers side of the business today
to handle live birds an to take interest in em reminds me of old times you see
they even used to eat chickens as meat in those days didnot they mr faddley
this was from tim course they did tim
but they wasnot the featherless birds we uses today you see
they had plump flesh and lots of feathers fair bunches of em like you can see at the zoo
and they used to run about the yard an scratch in the ground an peck an cluck an squat in the dust like anything
twas music to me killed them mrs portral interrupted hastily
then they plucked all the nasty insanitary feathers off and then they actually burnt them in ovens lubricating them with animal fat and pigs meat while they burnt
i remember my mother telling me
talk about cannibalism said portral
the chief business of life today said geary
the whole business i say consists of and should consist of nothing but the efficient production and distribution of foodstuffs and manufactures and the vigilant observance of hygiene and sanitation
control of course sir education tim suggested bashfully
we can leave that to those responsible
tim quailed before truculent eye said the chief busi62 ness of life my boy
old faddley in the arc of the wall near the humidor switch wished that some other topic of conversation had been chosen
the very mention of oldstyle farms brought with it a strange nostalgia
while he had been speaking of the smells and sounds of his boyhood days on the land they came back to him with such vividness that he thereafter drifted into a day dream
he fancied himself standing by a gate watching the cows coming through from the churnedup pathway
there were no sounds of mechanism or whirr of wheels not even the distant chugchug of windsuncatcher
the air was calm warm with peacefulness as the cows came sedately through whisking their tails one after the other pausing for an instant to swing their heads sideward and favor faddley with meaningless stares
and the field in which they grazed the surface was delightfully uneven there were tufts and tussocks of grass not the soulless smoothness of modern meadows ready for great lumbering clattering nibblers to work on
how well he remembered
in the far corner near vhere the cabbages started were the hay ricks and vhat a pleasing aroma came from them especially when the sun came smiling after a shower
pigs and fowls and big farm horses and ducks
he never tired of watching the family of ducks waddling comically after the mother to the dear dirty pond behind the stables
dear oh dear
twas well over a century ago no smell like the farmyard mixture he thought and theres no animal like a cow
nevertheless on emerging from his reverie he felt that he had been betrayed by his unguarded enthusiasm into a social indiscretion
he noticed a difference in manner at once
mrs portral also had looked at him with an expression of distaste
there was that sort of aloofness evident in the room which might have followed the utterance of a blasphemy
from that moment faddley ceased to visit the gearys
he shrank into his shell
beyond an occasional business trip by air to canada or to bermuda he seldom stirred from his egg farm
he even refused his usual attendance as a delegate at the egg union weekend meeting in rio de janeiro
sad about the old man was the general verdict
getting into the sere and yellow at last
never was truly with the times you know
of course he has to be with production methods because of the law but at heart hes a reactionary
people shook their heads and went about their business leaving old faddley to his egg hatcheries
such a progressive age with so many diversions to occupy what used to be known as leisure could easily forget a man who properly belonged to the past
but faddley was destined to emerge from obscurity at last and to dart across the suy of the worlds news like a meteor of sensational dimensions
there was scarcely a civilized home in the five continents in which the faddley case was not a topic of conversation from the moment of its first flashing on their visiscreens one of the biggest newsscoops in the history of the transmission had authentic firsthand information of the event
he retailed his intelligence with gusto to the visitors who had dropped like locusts on his tarmac oi hearing that he had something to say thus geary shared in the sensation to his great satisfaction
in his favorite attitude on the recliner he thus held forth can tell you all about it the most amazing thing thats happened in america for many a long year
he had a great opinion of himself as a raconteur and meant to make the most of his opportunity now
this fellow faddley is perhaps the oldest man in the egg business today old in point of years too
well most of you know him i believe is an instance where the crookedness of age warps a mans mind and sends him into a groove of madness
i suppose he had felt himself gradually being left behind by the younger generation you know snubbed would be the word and it preyed on him
anyhow it turns out that for some months before the tragedy he had indulged in a sort of ritualistic retirement meditation and so on in one of his big egg flats that he kept for emergencies
imagine a man of his age locking himself in that enormous building surrounded by tier upon tier of empty incubators laying boxes and all the paraphernalia of his trade
a solitary little figure in that great loneliness tired of the world or disgusted with it i donot know which stay there all day so mrs faddley said and most of the night only going indoors to his home toward dawn
nothing she could say would shake the old fool
if she wanted him to meet company he would growl out that he had no time for it
the man must have been for he had known the whole place inside out for years and that the reserve flat had always been empty and had never heard so much as a single cluck from a layer
anyhow as the inner door swung open there came to the ears of the inspector a dreadful sound like a soul in torment echoing in the back recesses of the flat and then old faddley came running out with a face as white as death
what time yesterday did the arrest take place asked a young airman was up at the time and had no visiscreen on the dash
seven oclock on tuesday evening replied geary
about four hours after he was interrupted by the flashing of the visiscreen that occupied the greater part of the wall to his left
by jove he said the end of the tale
for the visiscreen flashed faddley case trial result
harold james faddley age of upman egg farm wilts sentenced to suspension from all public production work with loss of privileges for life
he admitted his guilt on all counts to smuggling from province of china by air egg liner to harboring in federal domains and on scheduled premises to leading on scheduled grassland under concealment of night contrary to hygienic acts and public laws a prohibited animal to wit a cow a thoughtprovoking novelette of and scientifically controlled destinies by i roamed the universe a lone avenger of the spaceways and no man in the entire solar system guessed his secret
lanoth started walking toward the wanderer his cohorts behind him of the by author of the discus men of ekta warriors of eternity etc
a of intense sadness lay like a blanket upon the grounds and the dullgleaming mansion of walter brundage owner of the small dark star merthel
for janice garth beloved young granddaughter had for many hours lain ill with some strange malady
miriam garth mother of the stricken child stood before the screen in the visigraph room impatiently waiting for the operator to adjust his apparatus to the broadcast beam
then at a signal from the technician she swept up the portable speech transmitter
brundage city on merthel calls ing the wanderer
calling the wanderer
emergency call
brundage city calling the wanderer
the young woman spoke into the microphone until her throat became dry her voice husky
but there was no answer to her call
the visigraph screen was blank
had she been too late
if only daniel her husband were here with her now how much easier it would be to bear
she longed for the comfort of his arms his soft words of encouragement his love
daniel garth who had been enmeshed in a web of circumstantial evidence built up by lawless conspirators daniel who had been convicted and sentenced for life in the plutonian penal institution for a crime which he had never committed
suddenly the glittering surface of the visigraph screen reddened
words in a flat metallic voice crackled from the reproducer
the wanderer stands by for visual connection with brundage city merthel
the visigraph cleared and there appeared before miriam garth the image of the universal man of mystery the wanderer
a weird picture there on the screen the picture of a man clad in a grotesque black steel space suit of a type not generally accepted by rocketmen
no person knowingly had ever gazed upon the features of the wanderer
there were no transparent windows in his helmet and he had never removed his space shell in the presence of others
neither had his natural voice ever been known to register upon human ears
two retinascopic photoelectric cells set in the face of his helmet surmounted the slitted orifice of a speech reproducer
on either side of the iron head was a sensitive cylindric microphone
a small oxygenerator of peculiar design was affixed to the armor of his shoulders
thus the wanderer vas able to breathe see hear and speak without his identity becoming known
miriam garth daughter of brundage calls the wanderer miriam spoke nervously into the transmitter
my daughter has been brought down by a strange form of lethargic encephalitis which our merthelian physicians do not understand
daniel garth the childs father who is a prisoner on pluto is affected similarly
but dr vacor the prison surgeon has been able to keep him alive for three years
i feel that if dr vacor could see my child there might be a chance to save her life
breathless miriam paused then went on but we have no space ship in which to carry her to pluto
bors lanoth the pirate attacked our city and destroyed the only ship on the planet
if you are near merthel will wonot you take her
the electromechanical countenance showed no sign of human emotion as he replied prepare the child for the flight
i shall land upon merthel shortly
the distant sun pale and anemic plunged beneath the jagged western horizon as the trim little ship with braking rockets bellowing a mighty challenge to the bleak merthelian landscape dropped gently upon the ground near the brundage mansion
a side port in the ship hissed spun open and the wanderer stood there on the ground waiting his electric eyes casting twin shafts of dull smokyred light into the shadows
miriam garth and her father both clad in heavy electrically heated fur garments approached the ship
walter brundage bore the unconscious form of his granddaughter in his arms
the wanderer motioned them toward the open port
he waved aside their thanks boarded the ship behind his passengers closed and sealed the port
he made them comfortable and placed the child on a springsuspended litter fastened her securely to guard against the strain of acceleration
then he went to the controls of his oneman ship
he turned to miriam and her father said ascension
ready replied brundage
the wanderer glanced at the indicators before him moved a lever
the ship rose rapidly on an even keel her underjets roaring in crescendo
acceleration
again brundage spoke their readiness
with a blast of stern rockets the ship shot outward in a long arc toward the disc of pluto the wanderer his body braced against the support rails gradually adjusted the gravitation plates as pull lessened
after the fierce thrust of acceleration had subsided miriam let her eyes linger upon the motionless figure of the pilot
who was this strange man in black steel armor this weird avenger of crime who was ever ready to assist someone in acute distress
laymen on every planet had advanced the theory that the wanderer was a senseless cosmic ray automaton remotely controlled by some human intelligence
but scientists contended otherwise
the wanderer had displayed certain reflexes to unforeseen contingencies they claimed that denoted perfect coordination of mind and body
this could not have occurred the men of science stoutly declared in the case of a mechanical robot
the wanderer had first come into interplanetary prominence by swooping to the aid of a group of embattled space patrolmen on the inner satellite of mars and assisting them in the extermination of a band of pirates
thereafter wandering ceaselessly through the black night of space the wanderer had waged an almost singlehanded warfare against piracy until but one outlaw leader now remained alive bors lanoth
the deeds had made of him a legendary figure of romance and mystery had earned him the title wanderer of the void
and the fact that he was a masked unknown lent glamour to his exploits
he had agreed to reveal his identity only when bors lanoth last of the space pirates no longer roamed the skies
thus miriam sat in meditation fo many long minutes her mind reviewing the colorful history her thoughts returning at last to her personal troubles
there was daniel her husband a convicted felon who for three years had lain in a deathlike sleep in the plutonian prison
and now janice was affected in a like manner
what was the nature of this unknown physical condition tnat had seized them
tears started afresh to eyes
she turned toward the observation port beside her gazed out in an abstracted manner
then she sat upright in her chair
many miles out across the blackness of space she saw the unmistakable orangered flame from the stern jets of a space ship the yellow dots that were portholes in the side of the vessel
she announced her discovery to the wanderer
yes he said know
that ship has been pacing us for more than an hour
it is bors flagship manned by his followers from the reptile planet
i knov it by the set of its rockets
for a long time i have sought an encounter with lanoth a fight to the finish
he would never give me that opportunity
but now while i am on a mission of this sort he brings the fight to me ear tore at heart with icy fingers
the young womans nerves burning like redhot wires were at the breaking point under the severe mental burden that had been imposed upon her
she slumped listlessly back into her seat suddenly deciding to place her faith blindly in the ironclad creature at the pilot controls before her
deceleration the wanderer announced
brundage hastily affixed elasti barnesses about miriam and himael the child required no attention she was suspended on all sides
vibration of the stern ceased
then abruptly ilranr her frail body surge fcrwiri arans the supporting straps as me braking rockets flamed nt ie
miriam stared out at ship which had now ranged much closer
the craft had cut propulsion rockets and was braking fiercely nosing downward for a landing on pluto
wind shrieked about the hull of the vessel as it hurtled into frigid atmosphere
the wanderer regulated the gravitation reactor accordingly
they soon dropped to a jarless landing upon an iceincrusted plain near the penal institute
the wanderer brought out space helmets and oxygenerators from a locker in the ships nose
as you know atmosphere at night is but slightly above absolute zero he said
you will need these to protect your lungs against the extreme cold
there is a small one to accommodate the child
all are fitted with shortdistance cosmic ray transmitting and receiving apparatus
the wanderer placed a helmet about the head of each of his passengers started the oxygenerators saw that the communicating devices were functioning properly
the voice boomed in ears require no space gear for myself he said as if in answer to the question she had been about to voice
my helmet is sufficient
the girl looked at him and wondered
there will be fighting perhaps and you will need a weapon
the wanderer looked at brundage and indicated a rack of guns on the far wall
brundage selected a side arm and a long gun provided himself with ammunition
the wanderer inspected the brace of wauxum highpressure pistols that hung in clip holsters at his own waist
miriam and brundage donned their fur garments and the young woman took the child in her arms
they then followed the iron man into the airlock and paused at the quartz window in the exit port ship was just settling down some hundred or more yards away the flame from ier under jets blasting out a wide berth in the ice plain
it would be best for you to remain on the ship the wanderer told miriam
he opened the lock and he and brundage stepped down upon the ice
miriam closed the port behind them pressed her face close to the windov her heart thumping madly against her ribs
the dark plutonian night was bitterly cold hazy with drifting flakes of congealed and frozen atmosphere
overhead stars glittered with a sort of frigid jewellike splendor adding a touch of eeriness to the frozen world below
miriam jerked nervously at the burst of white illumination that suddenly came from the pirate ship
she could now see plainly her father and the wanderer striding purposefully across the ice crystals
a port in the great ship opened and a spaceclad man whom miriam instantly knew to be lanoth leaped out
the young woman shuddered almost overwhelmed with nausea at sight of the reptilian horde that poured out of the lock behind the pirate leader man half crocodile they appeared to be walking upright upon their short stubby hindlegs their long horny tails sliding upon the ice
a single large eye set in the center of their foreheads glowed with a baleful luminosity
they leaped and cavorted about lanoth brandishing weapons grasped in their webbed hands
they wore no space suits for they were inhabitants of a planet far more frigid than pluto
lanoth waved them back and started walking toward the wanderer
the two men halted facing each other at a distance of thirty feet
brundage was to the left and slightly back of the wanderer bis long gun held in readiness
the communicating device in helmet brought their conversation to her
ho wanderer
we meet at last
yes lanoth we meet
but not at a time to my liking
i have on board my ship a child vho is at the very threshold of death
her life is measured in minutes unless dr vacor the prison surgeon takes her in charge immediately
let me pass with she and her mother and i give you my word i shall return what care i if the child dies
lanoth snarled
you are indeed dull of wit
wanderer if you do not realize that this situation is little short of perfect for the fulfillment of my plans
i shall cancel the old charge against brundage as well as the one against you
miriam saw her father surge forward heard him rasp damn your black soul lanoth
a gun flashed in the hand of a reptile man
brundage spun slumped to the ice lay still
the wanderer fell into a crouch came up with mechanical precision a flaming gun grasped in each of his metal hands
lanoth gave ground before the terrible fusillade
he had not been able to match the lightning double draw
but now his guns were out and up blasting forth the hatred of their owner
the wanderer his own guns jerking viciously marched steadily forward into the blazing death that hurtled at him from the hands of his adversary
behind lanoth the reptile men held their fire fearful of striking their leader
crouching beside the window in the little space ship miriam garth heard the clang of bullets against the helmets and armor of the men on the snow plain before her felt the vibration as missiles struck the hull of the vessel
brundage was moving now was getting on his feet
he had only been stunned by the bullet
the helmet had saved him
he brought up his rapidfire long gun brought it to bear upon followers pressed the trigger
but the pirates closed in upon him slowly inexorably despite the menace of his gun
lanoth and the wanderer were close together now still blazing away at each other
miriam marveled that either of them had survived the withering fire from the others guns
lanoth began to weave about from side to side
and then the wanderer dropped to one knee
up
miriam shrieked into the little microphone in her helmet
get up
wanderer
the wanderer shook his head as if to clear his brain got slowly and wearily back to his feet
he took deliberate aim and his left gun spat once at the pirate leader
lanoth staggered the weight of his guns swung his limp arms to his sides and he crashed to the ice in a crumpled heap
the reptile men came forward in a rush
miriam was about to turn from the window when suddenly from out of the darkness in the direction of the penal institute there charged more than a hundred spaceclad giants some swinging huge swords above their heads others firing wauxum guns rapidly as they ploughed through the frosty ice dashing straight toward the band of half men
some of the pirate crew sought to escape by fleeing into their ship
but their line was quickly broken hacked to pieces by flickering doubleedged swords blasted out of existence by guns in capable hands
soon it was all over
out there on the ice lay the members of inhuman crew
none lived save those who had sealed themselves in the pirate ship ope blossomed anew in heart
guards from the prison had come to the aid had defeated the pirates and made it possible for janice to be taken on to dr vacor
perhaps it was not yet too late suddenly ship shot upward at an angle stern first with half her underjets working
the big vessel rolled and pitched her banks of keel rockets firing intermittently
the surviving reptile men were making a desperate effort to take off from pluto
evidently unskilled hands were at the pilot controls
the roar of cross talk in phone ceased abruptly
an tative voice spoke crisply in the plutonian tongue
then as the pirate craft nosed skyward under power of its propulsion rockets a thin line of green flame lanced up from the roof of the prison
two glononite shells exploded with a fierce white glare against the forward hull of the laboring space ship
a third tore away her jets
she rolled over slowly folded nose upon stern and plunged downward a seared and twisted mass of wrecked metal to a final resting place in the bleak mountain range that fanged the eastern sk
space piracy in the universe had ended miriam knew with the destruction of that mighty ship
the crusade was finished and the iron man could now unmask reveal his identity and retire to a life of peace and quiet
who was the wanderer
and what was the grudge that lanoth had harbored against walter brundage
brundage the wanderer and two of the guardsmen approached the little ship
they were coming to take janice on to the prison hospital to dr vacor
what would janice find there life
yes possibly
life in the form of an encephalitic lethargy that would drift ultimately into death taut nerves gave way
the young woman fainted slid slowly to the floor still tightly clasping her unconscious child to her bosom
later miriam garth opened her eyes in the prison hospital
she was on a long examining table and dr yedell vacor was bending over her
the huge physician offered a small vial filled with a thick yellow liquid
she swallowed the drug and immediately felt new life surge through her veins
vacor smiled said our roof lookout observed your encounter with the pirates and we sent guardsmen to your assistance
they brought you here
your daughter is safe in the room with her father
she has she regained consciousness face clouded
she has not mistress garth
it is a case that baffles me
her condition is the same as her fathers and i have been able to do nothing for him other than to keep him alive with intravenous injections of concentrated food and to take precautions against the collapse of his digestive system through disuse
what is the nature of his illness
miriam asked
three years ago earth time said vacor when your husband came to serve his sentence in this prison ha made a most unusual request
he asked to be placed in a chamber that had been specially insulated with a certain combination of metals
daniel garth was a scientist of prominence not a man with a criminal record so as superintendent of the institution consented
i knew he had sufficient reasons
shortly after his entrance here he fell into a stupor and physical degeneration set in rapidly
the latter ceased immediately however when he was placed in the insulated room
i have kept life in him but i have failed to restore him to consciousness for one small instant
he is not diseased he has fallen before the influence of some strange electrical emanation the nature of which i cannot understand
neither can i discover its source
your daughter is in the room with her father
perhaps some day they will recover completely
i do not know iriam tugged at the physicians sleeve
you have not told me everything doctor she exclaimed her voice edged with hysteria thing like this could not just happen
i know that this wave of electrical energy has been intentionally directed against daniel and janice by some intelligent being some person who wishes to destroy them both
and if they are securely shielded from the wave why do they not regain consciousness
you have formed some theory doctor
you must tell me
you are correct
mistress garth in your assumption that a deliberate attempt has been made upon the lives of your husband and daughter
i have definitely established that fact
the prison cosmic ray engineers have registered the emanation on their detectors but the wave is of such an infinitely high frequency that their instruments are not sufficiently sensitive to indicate the direction from whence it comes but you have not explained why they do not regain consciousness
vacor spoke slovly
indeed i have not
and i find it the most difficult of all explanations
i am a medical man not a scientist well versed in electrodynamics or cosmic ray radiation so i shall make the situation as clear to you as i possibly can
the human body as well as any given amount of matter vibrates at a certain frequency peculiar to its own size weight and chemical composition
to subject a human body to a wave whose frequency is the same as its own would bring about a number of physical changes
the brain would be most disastrously affected since it is the seat of the senses
the fierce upheaval of the identical frequencies beating together would almost instantly obliterate the mind drive out the ego the intelligence
next there would follow a general breaking down of the vital organs there was a deathlike pallor upon face and her voice sounded hollow in the great room
then the minds of daniel and janice have been utterly destroyed
not destroyed vacor said but released from their bodies
he motioned toward the darkness beyond the window
they are out there perhaps or in this very room with us
we do not know cannot know unless they return to their bodies
let us hope they do so
miriam pondered the immensity of the thought
it was beyond credence
human intelligences torn from their fleshy garments to be hurled naked out into eternity
where else
drifters in time and space
would they ever return to their bodies or was there some unknown and immutable physical law that would prevent at this point walter brundage came to the table
lanoth has regained consciousness and wishes to make a statement before he dies he said
the wanderer wants you as a witness doctor
they crossed the large room and entered a small operating cell in the surgery department on the left
the wanderer and a prison physician stood at either end of a metal table on which there lay a broadshouldered young earthman
the dying man turned his head slightly so that his failing eyes might bear upon the newcomers
miriam garth gasped
why she faltered why its jean
jean gossard
i canot believe it
yes miriam the whitefaced man on the table murmured jean gossard your childhood playmate is bors lanoth the pirate
i make this statement so that i may find some measure of peace in death lanoth or gossard coughed blood bubbling on his lips
dr vacor administered a stimulant
the pirate rested a moment then went on as you know miriam daniel garth and i both loved you when we were youngsters on earth
you cared only for daniel
this caused me to hate him to hate you to hate even your father
neither of you ever suspected it for i guarded my secret closely
my hatred flamed higher when daniel finished his science course at the university with high honors while i failed miserably
something happened to my mind i do not know what and i swore to make each of you pay dearly for what i then considered a great wrong a space ship to venus and there joined a band of pirates
using the name bors lanoth i eventually became their leader and built up a powerful organization
it is not necessary to recount our deeds now
they are well known to you
when denexium was discovered on merthel and your father went there miriam to supervise personally the mining i felt that my revenge was close at hand
and when you and daniel joined him it was i who took the cargo of denexium which daniel garth was accused of stealing
i worked out the false evidence that convicted him
he is innocent
a pained expression twisted the features of walter brundage
he bowed his head should have known it he muttered am sorry miriam
miriam placed her cheek against her fathers shoulder took his big hand in her small ones words came again in a whisper and it was i who subjected daniel to the ray that forced his intelligence from his body
but i did not direct a wave against his daughter
she after attaining a certain age and size and being the child of daniel garth and consequently of similar chemical construction became affected by a harmonic of the fundamental wave from my transmitter
she became attuned in much the manner as we in order to escape etheric noises and distortion adjust our visigraph receivers to a harmonic of the transmitting station
why did you not transmit this wave against garth early in his year of bonded freedom
vacor asked wished to greatly lanoth replied feebly because i feared he would trace the stolen denexium to its buyer on mars
but i did not perfect my transmitter until the latter part of the year
then mmch experimentation was necessary in order to determine the natural wave length of his body
where is this transmitter
brundage demanded
it was destroyed with my ship
there is no longer an emanation
lanoth turned his head slightly
now wanderer you have vanquished me
the the universe is waiting to learn your identity
tell them as you promised
and and jean gossard alias bors lanoth the pirate was dead
but the wanderer said nothing
he was leaning against the wall for support his arms hanging motionless at his sides the red glow in his electric eyes dimming rapidly
miriam suddenly remembered that she had seen him shot down in his battle with the pirate
the wanderer is wounded she cried
lanoth shot him will attend him vacor exclaimed
as vacor started toward the wanderer a young physician dashed into the room
dr vacor he said breathlessly
daniel garth and the child are regaining consciousness
come quickly
with a glad cry miriam ran past the young doctor and out of the room
brundage and vacor supporting the wanderer between them followed
a weak and slightly emaciated daniel garth sat on the side of his cot smiling
miriam flung herself into her husbands arms tears of gladness streaming dovn her cheeks
daniel she choked
garth spoke soft words of greeting
little janice who sat on the cot beside her father said that was a bad old dream i had daddy
brundage and vacor came in with the limp heavy body of the wanderer sagging between them
both spoke heartily to garth
daniel garth laughed
do not concern yourselves further with that heap of metal he said
toss it into a corner
i have finished with it
the two men stared
what do you mean
vacor asked quickly suspiciously mean said garth that you are burdening yourselves with an inanimate object
brundage turned to vacor
perhaps his brain is not yet clear he said laughed again
my mind is perfectly clear i assure you
i will explain
i built that robot in my laboratory on merthel some years ago synthesized a brain which i placed in its skull
the auditory nerves are connected with the microphones that serve as ears the optical nerves with the retinascopic photoelectric cells and the nerves of speech with the reproducer
the motor nerves doctor are connected with the mechanism that activates the robots body delicate relays making and breaking the different circuits in the course of motivation
power comes from a small almost inexhaustible battery of my own design
the brain is nourished by a certain fluid a pump circulates through it and brundage placed the robot in a chair
it is marvelous vacor murmured do not fully understand how the synthetic brain am coming to that garth went on
years ago on earth jean gossard bors lanoth and i experimented with a high frequency wave which we hoped would release the human intelligence from the body
we obtained little success and gave up
on merthel i experimented further wishing to liberate my own intelligence so that i might project it into the brain of the robot
then i was convicted of stealing a cargo of denexium and was forced to give up my laboratory work
toward the latter part of my year of bonded freedom i traced the denexium to a certain buyer in dotho mars
i secreted myself in this buyers warehouse several times and gained much information
i learned that it was lanoth who had stolen the stuff and made it appear that i was the thief further learned that lanoth was about to loose a secret wave against me
the pirate was aware of my effort to trace the metal and he did not want me to prove my innocence
peculiar physical symptoms which i experienced later indicated that lanoth had started transmitting his wave
the symptoms disappeared before i had suffered to any great extent only to return at regular intefvals for several days
then they ceased
the realiaation suddenly came to me that this was the sanie ray with which gossard and i had experimented on earth
lanoth then must be jean gossard
and he was seeking to find the natural wave length of my body
soon he would be successful
with only a few days of liberty remaining to me i hastened to merthel changed the appearance of my space ship placed the robot on board and hid the ship in a mountain range near brundage city
then i came here to start serving my sentence and requested the insulated room
i wanted ray to release my intelligence but i wished my body shielded against physical deterioration
when the ray forced out my intelligence i i shall call my intelligence entered the brain of the robot and started a warfare against lanoth and piracy in general too perfected a ray transmitter and incorporated it in the body of the robot in order that i might project my ego out of the synthetic brain when necessary released my intelligence tonight just after lanoth died and i my intelligence went out to assist drifting ego back into her little body
you have heard statement now with mine you have a clear picture of the whole affair
walter brundage stepped forward
my boy he said huskily do not know what to say about the part i took in prosecuting you
what can i do
erase it from your memory garth told him
the thunder of voice filled the room
by garth
then you are daniel garth clasped his wife and daughter to him am or was he said the wanderer of the void
coming soon a new penton and blake interplanetary exploration story by 295b a this i a to former slories a power has been so comma ffls power by twe to i etarre had not spoken to me it was she was my tvyo e that the supreme you out so reij mold its i land i noticed for several moors we stroocled dissolve you will be mere ghosts master novelette of world conquest the i a dying world stood alone upon the balcony
at his back towered the observatory with its mammoth telescope
below the balcony rough rocky clifs fell away to meet the restless sea which rolled and tossed fretfully
he swept the vast panorama before him with lidless eyes
from this prominence the country was visible for miles
off to one side in the distance loomed jagged peaks
on one of these stood a power plant an energy radiator one of the countless broadcasters which dotted earth in the portions still inhabited by men
the man if such he could be called gazed into the darkening heavens
behind the observatory the sun hung low in the sky
it had been that way for several hours its slow movement barely perceptible rotation was many times slower after five million years
mernoq himself represented an amazing spectacle
he was a man whom his ancestors of five million years before would have disowned as an incredible monster
given a latitude of fifty thousand centuries evolution had worked strange pranks on mankind
the biped which had held reign over dominions for the greater share of his long varied existence was much unlike his predecessors of the remotely distant mechanical age
was it fate coincidence or a dominating undying spark which had seen mankind speeds beyond the stars to flee by author of little hercules the jameson satellite etc mankind triumphant over all obstacles which had beset his path
since the mechanical age man had alternately scaled the heights of utopia and had tasted the dregs of chaos and degeneration stark shadow had fallen often across the portals of civilization yet the human race had proved itself undying
years of worldly strife had come and gone insect scourges had threatened and nearly won pestilence had waved its grimy scepter throughout the solar system and there had been interplanetary warfare
worst of all there had come invasion by space wanderers creatures from the faroff stars nearly invincible and equally as threatening
mankind on its planets and moons of the solar system had suffered enslavement
only by the the weird cavalcade bled inside the illuminated chamber destruction of venus entire atmosphere had mankind destroyed the inthe lifeless solar system of the fyfyre i vaders
this had happened long ago yet the earthmen remembered
mernoq was a typical earthman
he stood between four and five feet in height
standing upright on two legs which were jointed to move in either of two directions he had four arms two on each side each member terminating in eight fingers
the legs were much longer than the body
during the last hundred thousand years or more the body had grown smaller due to the increasing diminution and final disappearance of the digestive tract and organs of respiration
to keep alive humanity no longer found it necessary to eat and breathe
science had supplanted the comparatively short existence of the gastric organs with a more practical means of austenance radioactive blood was kept charged with energy from the huge broadcasting units
oxygen was superfluous
in this manner the life span had been materially increased until a life of ten thousand years had become common
the head of mernoq had neither mouth nor nostrils
like the appendix of man the unused mouth had finally disappeared
food no longer existed and articulate speech had long since yielded to mental telepathy
on either side of the head were slightly elongated ears curved to catch the slightest of sounds
two black lidless eyes peered intently from the face intelligence radiating from their depths
humanity had done away vith sleep
like food and oxygen it vas no longer necessary
the energy broadcasters recharged the body constantly
hair that telltale mark of barbarism had become unknown among earthmen
instead of hair there arose from the head fully two dozen antennae
these served a double purpose
they picked up the thought waves of their fellowmen and also received the broadcasted energy which supplied their bodies
mernoq stood looking at the distant broadcaster which threw pink waves of light in every direction
from this station he and the members of the observatory staff received the energy their bodies required
reception except in the case of the more powerful broadcasters was limited to a thousand miles or less number of broadcasters in one vicinity varied in accordance with the amount of population
there were few spots on surface one stood in danger of starvation
turning mernoq entered the observatory climbing a few short steps to where several of his companions were grouped about a table
upon it stood intricate machines
several of the earthmen were gazing at a large screen upon which the great telescope projected what it saw
a large pair of fiery stars occupied the center of the field
mernoq spoke mentally
the antennae of his comrades quivered slightly in attentiveness
the long night will soon be upon us with its terrible coldness
then we must retreat into the sealed chambers
sirius is nov nearing the zenith
eloow indicated the bright double star with a wave of his arm
it is time that uljoph returned said one of the others
he has been gone over thirtyfive years on his expedition to the twin suns of sirius rumor has come to me said mernoq
do not yet fear that the expedition has become lost in space
perhaps tonight our telescope may pick up the returning space ship rumor wnat have you heard
manipulating a set of controls at his side eloow looked up inquiringly into the face of mernoq
the rest watched the screen eagerly
sirius dimmed away into the distance as the telescopic field was brought closer to earth
vacuum yawned blackly at them
black and empty
reod exclaimed
mernoq remained silent in spite of this gloomy remark
he was thinking deeply
earth was a dying planet
a space expedition had been sent to alpha centauri in an effort to find a planet outside the dead solar system to which mankind might migrate
alpha centauri was found to possess sixteen planets none of them however suitable for habitation
the expedition to sirius had immediately followed
we shall wait five years more said mernoq and then another expedition will start out for still another star
but where
it has not been definitely decided
many of the nearer stars have been suggested
but we shall give this expedition time to prove itself
both uljoph and aamon are among the best commanders of the earthmen
why didnot you go yourself instead of aamon
he has always seemed bitter against you for your unparalleled success especially because the earthmen have placed their faith and reliance in you to lead them know mernoq replied
that is the very reason i sent him
i gave him the chance to distinguish himself along with uljoph
aamon is a mental genius and should be encouraged what of tonight
eloow wanted to know
you said you had had word
we have observed nothing with our telescope replied mernoq
the observatory at yigni however has sent me strange reports
as you are probably aware they not only have the most powerful telescope in the world but the most erratic one
they have sacrificed clarity for greater magnification
i received a report from bralel who is stationed there
he reports seeing a flash of the expeditions space ship returning from sirius
the vision blotted and faded
he gave me his telescopic figures
if those at yigni really saw the space ship coming home i calculated that it would show up on our screen either today or else tonight his information acted as balm for the impatience of the earthmen
but fully two months were to elapse before the space ship actually arrived
radio communication at that distance was impossible
civilization waited expectantly and anxiously
failure had crowned a previous effort
optimism however ruled to such a marked extent that partial preparations had been made for a departure from earth
the laboratories and workshops were kept busy
one question was uppermost in the minds of all
had uljoph and aamon found a perfect world in the system of sirius or had failure fallen upon the earthmen once more
and then one day the ship arrived plumbing waning atmosphere at a greatly reduced speed
out of it poured the forces of uljoph and aamon
they were unusually jubilant and seemed glad to be among their own kind once more after a departure of three and a half decades
they immediately joined mernoq
why did you not radio he asked them
our proximity with sirius destroyed many vital parts of our sending apparatus but we heard your messages before entering the solar system uljoph replied
it will be necessary to construct our sending apparatus on different principles when we return once more within the influence of sirius stated aamon
return echoed mernoq
then you have been successful
we have was the enthusiastic reply it was a colorful story which uljoph related
after fifteen years of space flight they had reached sirius discovering that it possessed twentyseven planets
the planets varying in size presented varying conditions
many of them had moons
commencing from the innermost planet the earthmen had explored them all even to the outermost world distantly removed from the dazzling orbs of sirius
two worlds had been found to be ideal
they were the sixth and eighth planets
the seventh world was habitable but was overrun with rank vegetation and loathsome forms of life
zyse the sixth planet was much to be preferred
bexn the eighth world teemed with animal life boasting a strange race of intelligent creatures
zyse was by far the most beautiful world of the entire system
we must desert this wornout world said mernoq
the vanguard of our people will soon start for zyse
but there must be more preparations made aamon argued
we cannot start at once
mernoq saw with disappointment that attitude was antagonistic
he saw enmity in his glance the enmity which mernoq hoped he would have lost on the trip to sirius
the great leaders reply however was conciliatory
yes preparations are indeed necessary before the greater share of us leave for the new world he admitted
yet during your absence our optimism led us to construct many space ships
a vast fleet of them is equipped and ready now on mars
no
i do not intend leaving for the new system until the last contingent goes
that will be a long time yet
i shall go with the last ships which are to carry the valuable kletin metal now stored on venus
months later the waiting space ships on the planet mars headed for zyse
they were the forerunners of the exodus the first ships to leave the old system
from that time on ships continually left for the new home planet until several years later there were but a few left
strangely enough aamon showed no desire to head contingents to zyse
mernoq was glad for aamon was valuable and seemed to have got over his old envy
beneath the monolith had become nearly abandoned as mernoq and two hundred of his men stood on the desolate planet venus
the suns huge globe hung just at the edge of the horizon
venus had ceased rotating
one side forever faced the sun a red hot hemisphere
the other side frozen cold by the temperature of space lay dark and as equally deserted
the atmosphere was gone a terrific war with the invaders from a distant star had destroyed the envelope of air ripped open fissures in the planet released the inner elements and had blown the cruel invaders into eternity
venus was as dead and deserted as moon or mars
stars shone crystal clear all about the sun gleaming and twinkling
in space suits the forces of mernoq walked over the cold surface of the planet
mernoq had brought the space ship to rest upon the narrow thousand mile strip of shadowland between the cold and flaming hemispheres of the dead world
mernoq now gave instructions to aamon
stay with the ship while we descend into the underground chambers after the kletin metal
be sure that the energy broadcaster continues to function properly
we shall be back shortly
enclosed in the bulky space suits with their multitude of exterior apparatus the earthmen headed for a tall monolith rising from a clump of rocks which strewed its base
reod shone a peculiar ray of green intensity from his space suit upon the broad base of the tover
almost immediately a doorway opened
in a long line the weird cavalcade filed inside and down a broad flight of steps into a large chamber
the walls glowed radiating an ethereal light of their own
in the center of the chamber stood a massive machine its various parts formed of intricate apparatus
this was the auxiliary energy broadcaster to be used in case the one on the space ship failed or in the event that the space ship was moved away from the vicinity
the sides of the vast chamber were pierced with small doorways leading to the storerooms of the kletin
when charged with a peculiar force of light produced by the earthmen this metal furnished gravity for the floors of space ships
it was to be found in large quantities upon the planet uranus and the earthmen had mined considerable of it on this far planet and moved it to venus for storage
in groups the earthmen entered the storerooms and started the removal of the kletin
mernoq saw one of the earthmen walk toward him with a load in his four arms
it was ibaeg and his action seemed a strange one
others were also emerging from the storerooms with the metal but with the exception of ibaeg they were all heading for the broad stairway leading to the surface
ibaeg where are you taking that
the man made no reply but hurried his pace
he ran straight for the energy broadcaster
mernoq and his subordinates were standing at the opposite end of the machine
ibaeg was approaching from the other side
sensing trouble of some sort uljoph hurried toward ibaeg seeking to intercept him
but he was not quick enough
striding up to the dormant energy plant ibaeg threw with all four arms his load of metal into the mechanism
there came a crashing note of twisted parts ernoq stared aghast at this strange action uncomprehending
the miscreant legged it for the flight of stairs those near him too surprised to think of pursuit
besides aamon and more of the earthmen were in the space ship outside
ibaeg could not escape
his action had been that of a madman
it was seemingly pointless
at the foot of the stairs uljoph stopped and stared upward
are you mad he demanded
ibaeg made no reply
he was nearly to the doorvay vhich led from the monoliths base when a terrific roar shook the subterranean chamber
then came a mighty concussion as if a gigantic body had thudded against the ground far above
with a frightful crash and billowing accompaniment of dust a great white boulder svept ibaeg off his feet and beneath it rolling dovm the stone steps grinding them to powder and smashing into the rocky wall
uljoph leaped out of the way just in time
the curtain of rock dust spread like a veil as large pieces fell from the fractured wall blocking the upward passage completely
the monolith has fallen exclaimed reod
he stared at the ruins in dismay
there was an explosion
all became quiet
the rock dust settled slowly
for a moment the earthmen surveyed the clogged passage in mental silence
not a square foot of opening was left
they were sealed as if in a tomb
we must signal aamon
he can dig us out with disintegrators
a call was sent out to aamon
the reply which came back jarred the sensibilities of the earthman worse than had the strange action of ibaeg or the succeeding explosion of the monolith
mernoq your reign is at an end came his vindictive thought waves
ibaeg did his work well the broadcaster is broken and you are entombed
when i leave for earth you will all die
i shall be free to build my own empire in the new system of planets but my men i have loyal men aboard ship exclaimed mernoq more out of surprise and consternation than contradiction
dead mernoq all dead just as you shall soon be gloated aamon
my supporters are many i now return to earth where i shall set a time explosion to detonate the atmosphere in the same manner employed by the earthmen who destroyed the atmosphere of venus ages ago you are mad aamon shall be safe far beyond the solar system when the cataclysm takes place
when i reach zyse i shall conquer the martian vanguard of ships and all other ships which have left since then alone shall be all powerful
now die mernoq you and all your puppets mernoq looked around at his companions who were stricken dumb by the rapid succession of events all planned so well by the evil genius of aamon
in each others eyes they read the agreement of the certain doom to befall them
the space ship containing the source of their sustenance was gone
the auxiliary plant in the chamber where they stood was wrecked
their situation was truly desperate have two hours in which to live was quiet yet deadly ultimatum
we may be able to repair the damage which ibaeg did but unless we hurry such repairs several of the earthmen who were skilled mechanics set to work on the damaged broadcaster
they worked steadily removing the damaged parts and repairing them
time moved by
an insidious sensation of weakness commenced creeping over the earthmen
suddenly one workman swayed dizzily
another workman sprang to the task taking the place of his fallen comrade
mernoq experienced a strong urge to sit down
his legs seemed no longer capable of holding his body upright
he fought desperately against this urge
when his knees sagged he was promptly caught in the arms of a companion who eased him gently to the floor
the time he inquired
how long have we
less than half an hour for most of us was the grim reply few of us may last even longer than that
mernoq felt himself lapsing into unconsciousness
fully threequarters of the earthmen had weakened and fallen
some retained their senses yet were too feeble to move
the lack of energy was making itself felt
the the lever came the weak mental communication from one of the earthmen who staggered to the machine with the two remaining parts
two of his companions weaved in the direction of the starting lever while the other stood at his side to assist him
behind them mernoq rose weakly upon his four hands
a strong subconscious prompting had returned him to consciousness
he seemed unable to rise
he watched cyponom reach for the lever with one hand his remaining three arms clinging to various nearby portions of the machine to support his sagging body
yxlese reeled helplessly against his fellow mechanic dropping the remaining bit of apparatus in its place
the piece had only to be fastened
yxlese reached out weakly to give the necessary twist
his arms stiffened and never reached the mechanism for his supporting comrade fell yxlese slumping across his inert body
through a haze of semiconsciousness cyponom watched mernoq crawl forward through an effort of tremendous will power reach the machine and pull himself slowly upward
a dizzy mist obscured the vision of cyponom
when it cleared he saw mernoq sag backward and hit the floor heart sank
at the last vital moment failure had mocked them
he was the only one left with his senses part of them and they were rapidly leaving him
he clung tight but seemed too weak to hang on any longer
he felt his grip weakening
his eyes wandered to the part which mernoq had made one final effort to reach and turn
his heart skipped a beat
it was fastened
mernoq had reached it
a darkness overwhelmed cyponom
the final order from his brain commanded three reluctant arms to drop their holds and seize the lever which the other arm held with its eight fingers
as cyponom fell the weight of his body pulled the lever
a grinding noise issued from the machine
pink vibrations of light danced from the apparatus forming a shimmer of color around it
strewed about the vast chamber lay nearly two hundred unconscious earthmen many of them close to death
entombed he broadcaster roared into action
soon the reviving earthmen their antennae picking up the energy from the waves which penetrated their space suits commenced to rise how much better off are we now lamented reod
we are entombed we are alive returned mernoq spiritedly and while life still exists within our bodies we may yet dare to hope
the philosophy of mernoq was sound
upon this philosophy mankind had clung tenaciously to life throughout the ages in the face of adversity
how are we to reach earth without space ships even if we do escape this place queried uljoph
reaching earth is but half as important as sending out a warning of treachery and his plans to explode the atmosphhere
but we have no way of getting to earth nor any way of signalling in time to forestall plan said uljoph have a plan mernoq told them a desperate plan one depending upon close calculations and long chances but first we must get free of this place
mernoq would not divulge his hopes
first he said they must win through to the surface of venus
the outlook was discouraging
on three sides solid rock surrounded them
the bowels of the planet lay beneath their feet while overhead lay heavy strata of mantle rock
the avenue before them was blocked with massive fragments of the great monolith interspersed with rock debris from the cracked walls of the passage once heard of a secret exit from this place said nenerm
where is it do not know was the uncertain reply
these chambers are old
no one alive can remember when they were built
there is a legend telling of an attempted escape of the space invaders long ago
a group of them burrowed deep inside venus
they were all destroyed by the earthquakes which followed the destruction of the atmosphere
a passage from these caverns is supposed to lead through their secret exit
then why were these caverns not destroyed by the quakes asked mernoq
that is what throws doubt on the truth of the legend replied nanerm yet the legend exists
mernoq at once ordered his men to tap the rock walls in search of hollows beyond
the earthmen spread out into small groups searching carefully the adjoining storerooms as well as the central chamber
both wall and floor space was nearly covered before an excited telepathic communication burned itself upon his brain
we have found it
mernoq and his subordinate officers hurried to the spot
several of the earthmen held back a section of rock which balanced nicely on a convex axis
a dark passageway lay beyond
uljoph advanced into it but mernoq motioned him back
let the stone swing into place he said
we must be sure that it is dependable and will open at the right time in case we must return this way he stone swung back
as mernoq had feared the opening of the secret door had been gropingly accidental
after much experiment the concealed exit was reopened
a combination of pressure movements on the nearby wall was necessary
mernoq and his men took careful note of these
he was then satisfied to enter
he detailed twenty of the earthmen to stay with the energy broadcaster and keep it working properly
watch it carefully
our lives and yours depend upon it
we shall follow this passage to the end
if we fail to reach the surface we shall return
if we win through we shall communicate with you when we arrive back at the spot where the monolith stood
with these parting instructions mernoq and the remainder of the earthmen snapped on the glowing lights of their space suits and filed into the cavity out of sight around a bend in the tunnel
the opening was closed softly behind them
they tramped for miles through the interior of venus the tunnel sloping gradually downward
mernoq commenced to despair of ever reach ing the surface yet he was determined to follov the tunnel to its termination
it became warm excessively so
although the surface of venus was dead and cold the interior was not
the earthmen became aware of this more than ever as the passage continued its downward slant
then through the gloom ahead of them they saw the end of the subterranean passage
it ended blankly yet as they approached nearer and their lights dispelled the shadows they saw faint square outlines of a huge door
a vague murmur beyond made them pause and grow apprehensive
mernoq broke the suspense by ordering it opened
several of the earthmen seized the huge metal pull shaking loose from it the dust of ages
no lock was in evidence
constructed of stone and metal the door was massively built towering far above the height of the earthmen who tugged at it
contrary to the expectations of mernoq however the door opened easily partly of its own volition so it seemed as if it had waited patiently through the long centuries
had the earthmen only known it the door had remained closed for more than a quarter million years
a black dust vomited forth from the doorway whirling and falling among the earthmen
there followed a rumble like a thunderclap
beyond the doorway lay a vast cavern whose high walls threw back the red and green glow of lurid flames
to their startled eyes were revealed long tongues of fire shooting up to lick the ceiling
they were no such flames as the burning of oxygen might produce
the flames were red and terminated in oval tips edged with a bluegreen luminosity
come
mernoq strode fearlessly in direction of the raging inferno
his men followed
in warm palpable dust which rose nearly to their knees they walked slowly toward the brilliant fire which as they approached nearer they found issuing from a broad deep crevice in the cavern floor
the internal fires of venus never believed they came so close to the surface
they stopped at the edge of the fife pit and looked across to where the cavern stretched away into the gloom
dimly visible were several rocky corridors
mernoq lingered for a moment undecided as to directions but he saw that one end of the crevice might be skirted and ordered the corridors to be explored
they circled the flaming cauldron to see what lay beyond
uljoph drew attention to the cavern ceiling
i was perfectly circular
the cavern was not artificial
an intelligence had constructed it
was the legend true
had the invaders fashioned this place as a tomb or hideaway or had mankind made their way to the internal fires long ago in the forgotten past
mernoq wondered
they walked close to the ragged edge of the crevice and peered downward
the fiery hell was fully a hundred yards across lurid flames obscuring the bottom
hidden by the flames a boiling inferno of molten rock gushed in and out of the planets interior
a mental cry of terror issued from across the darting flames
the antennae on head told him the directions from which the cry had come
rapidly he and his companions circled the fire pit and raced into the corridor from which the cry had issued
other earthmen were excitedly milling about inside
in the center of the throng they came upon a ghastly scene
seven earthmen lay dead mutilated their space suits crushed and ripped
the bodies had been torn to shreds
for a moment in the horror of the situation no one saw the large boxes whose ends flanked the passage
they lay on shelves
uljoph was first to discover them
he climbed over the side of one and looked down into the metal container
his mind ejaculated one thought
empty
meanwhile others were examining more of the strange boxes warning came too late for a long tentacle slid up over the side of a container sharp metal claws ing an inquisitive and unsuspecting earthman
zougmre wriggled to free himself
a monstrous body surmounted by a hideous head lifted up and more tentacles waved wildly menacingly as the creature glared balefully at the surrounding earthmen
six snaky arms writhed from the black repulsive body protected by an artificial shell of metal
the tentacle ends were tipped with metal sharpened to razoredged cutting power
a head with an eye in front and an eye in back of the oval cranium turned from side to side
the eyes stared intently exuding a cold crafty expression of intelligence
a blunt snout sniffed inquisitively
several of the nearer earthmen sprang to the aid of their stricken comrade but it was too late
three more tentacles curled themselves around the doomed man cutting his body to pieces
get out of here quick urged mernoq
we are powerless to combat them
down the corridors ambled five of the insidious creatures
more of them were emerging from the metal containers
the earthmen raced to the comparative safety of the fire cavern
what are they
the invaders exclaimed mernoq
the things that conquered the solar system ages ago we thought them all dead
impossible deplored reod
how could they have lived
suspended animation replied mernoq whose astute mind had conceived the truth of the situation
when we opened that door it released forces automatically which were necessary to bring them out of their sleep
air machines were set to working too
see
there is air down here now pointed to the leaping flames which seethed outward from the pit the bluegreen luminosity changing in color as it yielded to red and white heat
a tremendous wave of hot air sent them scurrying backward making them aware of its warmth even throughtheir space suits
we are weaponless against them cried uljoph
mernoq realized this fact keenly
the space invaders were not only armored but doubtlessly possessed weapons too
mernoq hurriedly led the way around the fire pit and into that black section of the cavern which lay ahead
he was hoping against hope
they must go that way and hope for a continuance of the tunnel
to return the way they had come would ultimately mean finding themselves trapped
these thoughts flew swiftly among them
what of the twenty men we left with the energy broadcaster
uljoph suggested
suppose they attack in that direction
the tunnel rises that way
the air will die out in the upper levels
but if their air machines generate more air
the ominous question remained as the earthmen set out on a run past the fire pit the increased heat of the flames driving them far to one side near the vall apprehensions grew less as he saw ahead of them the continuation of the tunnel
he had begun to fear that the cavern marked the tunnels end
the earthmen became weary after a mile or more of rapid running
it was the desire of mernoq to put a goodly amount of distance between them and the hateful creatures of the fire cavern
the latter had suspended themselves in a living death to bridge the ages with their menace
subterranean battle the satisfaction of the earthmen the tunnel struck a steep incline much steeper than the one they had recently descended on leaving the kletin storerooms
in some places steps had been cut because of the tendency toward perpendicular ascent
the climb was a long one
soon they found that the air manufactured below them was dying out
they were once more in the usual vacuum
the lower levels had been left behind
they came to a long flight of steps up which they climbed to find themselves in another large cavern
all around them lay water
they were on an island in a subterranean lake
their bright lights revealed shore little more than a hundred yards away
the island lay in nearly the exact center of the lake several hundred feet from shore
it bore evidences of having been purposely constructed
the water or fluid of the lake which was closely akin to water took on a peculiar appearance to the eyes of the earthmen
it appeared dull and without lustre
this was due largely to a lack of atmosphere
how can we cross queried uljoph
we can hardly swim with our space suits
if the water is not too deep cr the bottom is not full of holes we can walk across
if we could but drain the lake down through the passage why original idea vas lost in a brilliant burst of inspiration
his sudden enthusiasm was shared by the rest
drain the lake into the internal fires
kill the monsters
for a moment mernoq felt himself overwhelmed by the possibilities of the daring plan
in his minds eye he saw the waters of the lake rushing down the long tunnel filling the lower level and cascading into the molten pit of fire
there would be boiling chaos clouds of steam the long dormant invaders scalded to death
his indecision was short
cut a channel
the earthmen set to work a will rapidly cutting a ditch from the lake to the orifice of the tunnel in the islands center
luckily they possessed the rock picks which made up an essential part of their space suit equipment
rapid headway was made for the rock was a soft type peculiar to venus
a large group started working from the tunnel entrance while others worked up to their heads in water at the lakes edge their globed helmets rising out of the water only to disappear again
mernoq sent one of his men to gauge the depth of the lake
the man walked out of sight the water swirling above his head
from time to time he radiated reports to his comrades above
his space helmet finally broke the surface of the water near the farther shore where their lights had revealed a continuance of the tunnel
the lake was comparatively shallow
we can all walk across said mernoq
when this water starts draining into the lower levels we must hurry warned reod
steam will be forced back this way
what of those we left in the chamber of the broadcaster
uljoph inquired
if the steam rises they will die too
the steam will seek the nearest and easiest exit said mernoq
besides remember the heavy stone blocking the entrance to the secret tunnel
it will resist tremendous steam pressure of the earthmen made a starfling discovery
air is blowing up the shaft
it is rising into this cavern
it was true
a strong current of air blew up the tunnel bringing a thin veil of dust with it
mernoq feared the coming of the interstellar invaders
more atmosphere was being generated from the corridors leading off from the fire cavern
we must hurry
only a thin slice of rock separated the two channels which were nearly converged
the earthmen chopped madly with their picks
they had worked frantically in shifts only a fraction of their number being able to work unhampered in the ditch
a scout mernoq had sent down the tunnel now returned
they are coming
they have weapons
a trickle of water burst over the lip of the tunnel leading from the island to the lower levels
the alarm spurred the laboring earthmen to desperate measures in a superhuman effort to send the lake rushing down the tunnel before their ancient mies could emerge
upon the rising current of air came a deathly cry which the radiophone ears of the space helmets readily picked up
it was eerie and chilling like no sound the earthmen had ever before heard
one of the terrible things they had unwittingly revived strode into view below them on short squat legs
in several of his long tentacles he carried gleaming discs
the earthmen stood at the top of the shaft with upraised picks the only weapons they possessed
these were crude indeed compared to the destructive weapons which aamon had carried away on the space ship
two of the pale disc beams fell on the nearer of the earthmen focusing for but a brief moment
a round portion of each space suit glowed red then disappeared
underneath the flesh of the earthmen shone a ruddy hue iridescent sparks shedding themselves rapidlly
the unfortunate men fell dead while the discs of fire continued to burn completely through their bodies
the disc beams flicked upon others of the band
one of them staggered toward the water
another sank to his knees beside the tunnel
back he cried
with all four arms he brushed and struck madly at the glowing spot which ate through his space suit let them he rose suddenly and jumped down upon the advancing monster in a despairing leap as he felt the death ray eating swiftly into his vitals
his impetuous leap hurled back the interstellar invader upon four or five more who came crowding up from behind
for a moment all was confusion in the tunnel tentacles hastened the death of the martyred man who had used his rapidly expiring body to the greatest advantage
extricating themselves from the tangle of bodies and tentacles the terrible creatures of the fire pit scuffled up the shaft their disc rays waving wildly
a deluge of rushing water met them hurling them backward
one survivor clung with his tentacles to the lip of the tunnel opening
with mighty strength he pulled himself out of the strong current
fully a hundred picks hacked his tentacles as all four arms of the nearer earthmen rose and fell
the dismembered body devoid of anything with which to cling yielded to the strong pull of the current
the shrieking head with its hateful venomous eyes disappeared beneath the cascading water the horrid screeching muffled to a frantic gurgle or a moment the earthmen seemed rooted to the spot
several of their number lay dead victims of the disc beams
yet the earthmen had triumphed
reod shook his head ruefully fear for those we left in the chamber of the energy broadcaster
we must get back to where the space ship landed said mernoq
then we shall learn if they are safe
directions were quickly found and they headed for the distant monolith which lay broken and wrecked because of the treacherous attempt aamon had made to send them all into eternity
even now unsuspecting humanity upon the earth prepared for further contingents of the exodus while aamon was laying his plans
the thought urged mernoq to greater haste
he had a plan in mind
it was not long before the jagged remnants of the great monolith became visible upon the horizon
the earthmen hurried to the spot
where the entrance to the subterranean chambers had been located was now but a tumbled mass of rock
mernoq sent out a call to those they had left imprisoned in the kletin chambers with the energy broadcaster
it was answered
their comrades were alive and the mechanism was functioning perfectly
how are we to communicate with earth and warn them of treachery queried reod
we have no equipment
do you realize what type of explosive aamon employed in destroying the monolith
why yes
the explosive was annite
i recognized it when i heard the blast
the mind of mernoq still remained reservedly inscrutable
annite he continued is a queer explosive
what do you mean
its destructive forces are tremendous yet it has a peculiar fault when exploded in space or upon a planet which has no atmosphere
why yes fragments of it are generally blown off it and fail to explode
exactly
mostly through a lack of barometric pressure
and what good will that do us asked uljoph
in one of these large rocks we are going to hollow out a crude form of rocket gun mernoq explained
we shall charge it with the fragments of unexploded annite which is strewn about here on the ground
in a brief flash they recognized purpose
they were going to rocket a warning to the earth hoping it would reach there in time to prevent the cataclysm which aamon had planned
rocket messages were hastily made
with their picks the earthmen commenced fashioning a rocket gun in the side of a huge slab which faced away at the desired angle mernoq wanted
for the construction of the rocket itself mernoq searched among the ruins at the monoliths base for metal stanchions which had previously been built into the entranceway
it was here that he made a discovery which he considered fortunate
there is sufficient metal to build three rockets for dispatch to earth if we can gather annite to power all three
can we send a message without its destruction when the rocket crashes against earth
arrange parachutes to be released when the rockets hit atmosphere suggested uljoph
or we may be able to fix reverse annite charges in various positions so that the increasing friction with atmosphere will explode them and slow up the rockets speed
by searching a large part of the vicinity where the explosion of annite had occurred the earthmen gathered enough fragments to send off and equip with reverse charges all three of the rockets
mernoq and his subordinate officers figured the mathematical position of the two planets and their movements quite carefully also estimating the force of the annite
the rockets would hit their target
it is a long chance these rockets uljoph said grimly
what if none of them are found or suppose they land in an ocean where tjfiey cannot be recovered
in that case said mernoq it will mean the destruction of atmosphere and all human beings now on the planet
you think that aamon has done his work and departed for zyse
he has had time for it
our only chance is to get word to them in time to charge the atmosphere with a counteracting gas
one of telescopes may discover our plight here suggested reod
space ships may be sent have been thinking the same said mernoq yet it is probable that aamon has a ready story to tell especially in regard to the demolished monolith
each of the earthmen measured the possibilities and hoped the gages at the observatories on the earth picked up the proximity and composition of all foreign objects entering atmosphere
some of the rockets would be traced and found
the question of timely arrival however vas uppermost in their minds
in spite of the terrific power and accelerating impetus afforded by annite it would be a long time before the projectiles reached earth
a order the earthmen set off the first rocket
at long intervals the other two were sent into space
off they hurtled in the direction of the greenglowing planet which glowed steadily in the sky
earth and venus were nearly in line and the suns position favored the sight of the rockets
time must pass time which battled with the time aamon had set for the destruction of civilization
the rockets not only contained messages relating to perfidy but they also gave specific directions for charging the atmosphere
it was at suggestion that another chance of salvation was made possible
mernoq employed this at once
on a sloping wall facing the nlanet earth messages were written in gigantic characters on the chance that earth telescopes might be trained that way
time dragged for the waiting earthmen
a close watch was kept upon the green star for the earthmen were fearful of the telltale flash surrounding the planet which would tell of success
the earthmen knew that it would be a long time before the stellar messages reached earth a great number of times longer than passage by space ship
only a few days had passed when one of the earthmen issued a mental cry of excitement which brought the general focus of attention immediately upon the green glowing planet vhich swung far off in space heart chilled with fear
had the gigantic cataclysm been unloosed at last
his keen eyes searched for the telltale glare of destruction
instead he saw several bright specks growing larger in the sky
they expanded to view as they came and he saw that they were space ships
five in number they cruised about the vicinity of the wrecked monolith finally settling to rest
the stranded earthmen watched in undecided anticipation
was this help arriving or had aamon returned to finish the sinister work which had narrowly failed him the first time
several figures stepped from the nearest ship and approached them
mernoq with gladness in his heart recognized one of them as eloow atmosphere cried mernoq voicing the apprehension uppermost in his mind
is it saved we do not yet know for certain but we hope for the best how did you get here so soon
we sent rockets but that was but a few days ago we read your cliff message from our space ship said eloow
we were already on our way here
but aamon where is he
on his way to zyse but it is a small start he has
we left for venus secretly almost at the starting moment of ship in the direction of sirius
his course of flight has diverged only at a slight angle from our own
i was suspicious of him when he told how the monolith had been destroyed in blasting a necessary passage into the kletin chambers
he reported that you and the others not returned with him had decided to stay and move the kletin out upon the surface of venus before more ships were sent for it were these ships to come for us
mernoq asked
sixteen earthly days hence
when destruction of ai was consummated and he was safely on his way out of the solar system observed mernoq
and you were found entombed and dead added eloow
when our tele scope picked up the inscriptions you made on the cliff i dispatched one of our ships back to earth to take pre90 yentative measures against reachery
the formula for charging the air
mernoq interrogated eagerly
the formula so long preserved and which is entrusted to but a ievf of us you aamon and myself included
the same formula which our ancient ancestors used in keeping the exploding emanations from venus atmosphere harmless when they struck the atmosphere of earth
then our fears are at rest for aamon would not have timed the explosion to occur before he had left the solar system and you say that he has but a short start
that is so
aamon must never reach zyse mernoq avovied
it is unlikely that he shall replied eloow have suspected him ior a long time
i never placed the trust and confidence in him that you did
on one reason or another i held up most of the ships which were to leave with aamon but i could not manage to delay aamon himself
i did the next best thing
i placed a man aboard with orders to hamper the speed of his ship in case we wished to catch up
let us give chase at once
mernoq hurried with eloow to his ship
four ships rose from the cold dead surface of airless venus and raced off into space
the remaining ship stayed while its occupants set to work releasing the score of imprisoned earthmen attending the energy radiator
the course of ship had led sunvard designed on a straight course to sirius which would cut close to the orbit of mercury
earthmen eagerly scanned the proximity detectors as high speed was attained
the four ships spread out so that they cruised several thousand miles apart
they were nearing orbit when the sunward ship of the group first picked up the location of slowermoving space ship
the four pursuing ships gradually converged
a message was radiated for aamon to stop
his answer was a vicious blast of power which narrowly missed the nearest ship of fleet
aamon put on a sudden spurt of speed
it was evident that minion who had been responsible for the slowing up of ship had been detected
that his end had been a swift one neither eloow nor mernoq doubted
the four ships kept abreast of at a safe distance
another blaze of power went wide of its mark
still another and much closer charge caused one of the pursuing ships to tumble crazily in space until it once more righted itself
shall we fire asked eloow turning to mernoq
mernoq nodded grimly
the order was communicated to all four ships
simultaneously blasts leaped out at the fleeing craft
two of them struck
they waited to see the extent of the damage ship demolished at one end rolled awkwardly off its course still hurtling at meteoric speed
mernoq and eloow watched the proximity detectors
a series of blasts from the spacewrecked craft lashed savagely and spitefully at its avengers
they were ineffectual yet revealed dangerous potentials which were still another barrage will finish him
mernoq halted in the act of issuing instructions as eloow gripped his arm and pointed significantly at the proximity detector
aamon has lost his propulsion power
he is falling into the sun
what end could be more fitting
we have only to stand by at a safe distance and watch him go to a wellmerited death
mernoq revised his orders to fire
instead his ships formed a funeral consort about the doomed and helpless ship of his archenemy whom once he had trusted and encouraged
they cruised too far distant for aamon to vent any further spite upon them although he made several vain attempts
nearer and nearer the great flaming globe of the sun they raced the initial momentum of ship at the time he had been struck swervingly diverted tovvard the suns incandescent mass
he had no power to change the course
the end was inexorable
so fast were the five ships moving through space that soon the ships of the fleet commenced to feel the tremendous drag of the suns immense attraction fall was accelerating
he and his faithless crew were consigned to a flaming hell which would consume them long before they ever reached it
they were to die a horrible lingering death of suffocating heat watching tormented ly the sunward side of their space ship grow red then vhitehot before they perished miserably
something of this inevitable doom must have impressed itself on aamon for in the middle of the funeral cortege the cosmic coffin with its living and doomed cargo burst suddenly into a bright flash of light
where a slowmoving dot had rested on the proximity detectors there were now but a few tiny specks slowly radiating from a central point
aamon had chosen the easier way
no longer did he stand as a menace to mankinds peace and security in the exodus to the new world

a ross superman of future eons knows but one master evolution
by author of the comet doom the accursed galaxy etc he little ratfaced man looked fearfully at the mechanism in the corner of the lamplit laboratory
it was like a tall cylindrical cage of metal bars connected electrically to the generators huge vacuum tubes and other apparatus in the room
he turned jerkily toward the other two people in the room
one was a serious lanky young man the other a girl whose soft face was pale and whose dark eyes held hooded apprehension
these two were ross sherill brilliant young biologist and his wife gail
the ratlike little man asked fearfully is that the machine
the thing youre going to use to to change me it fraham said ross sherill steadily
the projector that is going to throw you a million years ahead of the rest of the human race in evolutionary development
his serious eyes kindled with scientific enthusiasm as he addressed the wizened little fraham evolution is ordinarily a very slow process he went on a physical and mental change which i recently you think i want to be a halfape a severed is caused by certain kinds of cosmic radiation that effect slight changes in our bodies forcing our race ever higher on the road of progress found out how to produce those forces artificially many times stronger
so when i turn those vastly intensified forces on your body you will in a few minutes pass through evolutionary changes that will take a million years for the rest of the race to pass through naturally
yes but whatll i change into cried fraham
suppose i change into something awful what then
once thrown you ahead in development and observed what the human race will evolve into i can bring you back to your present status sherill told him calmly found a certain cosmic radiation that reverses evolutionary change and use that on you
the lanky young scientist took a packet of bills from his pocket the thousand dollars i agreed to give you for submitting to the experiment get it when were done raham stiffened at sight of the money and an ugly gleam came into his slitted eyes might add that youll get the money only by undergoing the experiment sherill added pleasantly have a pistol in my pocket and if you try shoot
well what about it are you willing to undergo the experiment face was beaded with perspiration and his eyes rolled from the money to the bulky enigmatic mechanism
he finally spoke hoarsely got to do it and you know it you know the police are hot after me and that i need that grand to get out of the country
but remember he added desperately you promised to bring me back so be just like i am now will youll be out of here in an hour ross sherill told him eagerly
step inside the projector
as fraham slowly obeyed entering the cylindrical cage with steps weighted by dread gail sherill laid a trembling hand on her husbands arm
her dark eyes held fear
ross she said afraid of this experiment
i wish youd give it up bother me now dear please the tense young scientist begged
he was turning switches shifting controls
the generators around the room broke into humming life the great tubes silently lit to a violet glow transformers sprayed a crackling brush
sherill his hand on the final switch regarded the terrified little man inside the projector
just stand steady fraham he said
it will take only fifteen minutes of exposure to the force
he flung the svitch
brilliant white light broke from the vertical bars of the projector a blinding cascade of radiation that hid from sight the trembling man inside
the evolution accelerating force was playing upon that mans body millions of times more powerful than such forces had ever played upon a human being before
ross sherill watched tensely his hand on the switch
behind him gail watched too her slim figure rigid with fear of the unknown
what was going on inside that glowdng halo
what tremendous changes were taking place in fraham as the awful cosmic forces flung him through thousands of years of future development each minute
it was ghastly unholy the fearridden girl told herself this artificial shortcut on the road of slow evolution her husband was violating the basic laws of the universe itself in thus hurling a human being a million years past his fellows in development
why had she ever let him do it
sherill counted the minutes beneath his breath
fourteen fifteen
he threw the switch open
the blinding glow of radiation died and they stared petrified at the man inside the cylindrical cage
the wizened ratfaced little criminal had vanished and in his place stood a man of superhuman terrible aspect
his huge form was bursting from clothes
for this man was almost seven feet tall with colossal shoulders tapering down into a lean perfect body of tremendous strength
a body that was as much superior to the ordinary human form as man is to the ape
but the face
it was godlike in terrible beauty the features perfectly regular the mouth a straight merciless line the eyes enormous glowing ones through which looked a cold vast mind whose shock was felt tangibly
the head was quite hairless
my god cried ross sherill staring in amazement at this superhuman figure
fraham changed ross change him back cried gail clutching her husbands arm in terror afraid
too late for that
fraham or the godlike man who had been fraham was stepping out of the projector
his glowing eyes fastened on sherill and the dazed young scientist felt those eyes reading the depths of his mind like an open book
that inhuman gaze swung to pale face and she flinched in horror from it hen the transformed coldly beautiful face turned back to sherill
he spoke in an icy level voice
to think it was you a savage semianimal who developed me
fraham said ross sherill hoarsely
you did change into the kind of man all men will be in a million years
he went on with desperate hope
all right now that seen what the course of future evolution will bring forth bring you back to your former state
step back into the projector
the creature before them laughed
a cold terrifying and mirthless laughter
you amuse me he told sherill
do you think that i would let you change me back now into what i was into a dimminded shriveled halfape like yourself
no i stay as i am and with my brain i can bring all your witless race under my rule easily
ross gail cried desperately to her husband do it if you let him stay like this
you must change back
ross sherill suddenly produced the pistol in his pocket and levelled it at the godlike heart
back into the projector fraham or shoot he cried donot intend to let my experiment release a superminded monster on the world
the superman before him laughed again
you think to match wills with me
throw that weapon out of tha window
his glowing eyes were riveted on ross as he uttered the command
as those supernal eyes bored into his soul the young biologist felt himself losing control of his own body
he tried to pull the trigger and couldnot
his muscles were obeying not his own mind but the hypnotic command of the creature before him
resistless his hand went up and flung the pistol out of the open window
fraham went on contemptuously in that eerie cold voice
you begin to see how helpless you are to resist me
just as helpless will all men be when i appear in their cities and order them to submit to ray rule
his glowing eyes flashed may have to destroy many of them before they learn my power
but it will be easy
my mind can devise weapons against which your race will be powerless to resist
i will build the first of those weapons now
as sherill and his wife watched the superman moved swiftly about the laboratory picking up some ebonite rods two copper discs a small piece of bismuth and other odd objects
they saw the transformed fraham deftly quickly join these things together into a tripodlike instrument crowned by the two discs
ross sherill realized in horror that it was some awful weapon of the future designed to be used upon present day humanity
the lanky young scientist crouched leaped for throat
fraham whirled and the hypnotic a command of those terrible eyes froze sherill halfway across the room
you will remain in this room you two commanded the superman while i test my new weapon outside
i can use you as subjects to test other weapons upon
without another look at them he strode out of the room with his curious weapon
looking numbly out through tha window into the moonlight they could see his huge figure striding up the slope of the hill behind the old country house
they saw him stop up there on the crest where he seemed to be setting up and adjusting the tripodlike thing
ross sherill threw himself toward the door get the pistol i threw outside he cried to his wife
that monsters got to be killed at once or hell destroy the world
he reached the door and stopped
he could go no further his muscles were obeying the hypnotic command of the superhuman fraham and not his own will
sherill concentrated strongly but could not get through that door
neither could gail when she tried
ross we canot get out she sobbed
we got to cried the young scientist wildly
if we donot be responsible for the havoc that creature will wreak on earth
then he pointed through the window and cried look hes trying that devilish weapon now
up there on the crest of the moonlit hill they could see the huge figure of the superhuman fraham bending over his tripod instrument
they glimpsed a swift terrific flash of white fire or force that drove out into the moonlight from the thing
they saw the monstrous superman straighten and peer into the silver night as though to see the effect of that tremendous bolt as it struck somewhere far away canot stop him
gail was exclaiming her eyes wide with dazing horror like children against a brain like that unable to oppose our minds for a minute against his
like a bomb exploding in his brain an idea burst blindingly upon ross sherill
we canot oppose his mind now no he cried but what if i throw myself forward a million years in development with the projector also
then have a mind as vast and powerful as his i could fight him
he leaped instantly toward the cylindrical cage going to do it gail
it will only take fifteen minutes for the force to throw me ahead and i donot think hell return before then
gail clung to his arm crying
no ross donot she pleaded become a monster like him wonot
sherill told her desperately
fraham was of a predatory criminal cast of mind and that is why even after he had developed so tremendously he still had in mind only the desire to dominate and prey on the world
but i want only to destroy the nienace of fraham and when done so reenter the projector and you can use the reversing force to bring me back
before the terrified girl could protest further he had entered the mechanism
throw the switch gail he commanded urgently little time
the girls hand numbly closed the switch
inside the cage of bars ross sherill was almost blinded by the terrific burst of glowing force from about him
as that awful flood of tingling force saturated every atom in him he felt hurled through abysses incredible fathomless and staggering
he felt his mind and body changing expanding unfolding with each passing minute
vast new vistas of thought opened out in his mind things that had before seemed complex and obscure became crystal clear to him
he felt a superhuman enhancement of his powers of reason
he knew he could solve problems in a moment that wculd take an ordinary man months or years
and as his body changed and grew he felt a boundless physical vigor he had never felt before
his emotions were withering and dwindling and a cold logic was now dominant in his mind
he was becoming he knew the kind of man all men would become in a million years
and it seemed to him now that in changing from his former cramped body and mind he was stepping from an animal state into one of full humanity
the glow of force died about him as the switch was opened and he could look out now into the laboratory
before him staring wildly at him was a girl
he felt a repulsion at sight of her
this savage semiape female thing so undeveloped of mind and body had he really loved this
his new mind sickened at the thought
she was running toward him crying ross then she stopped and he saw horror and fear deepen in her eyes as she met his own gaze not ross at all she whispered changed like fraham afraid of you
she was shrinking back from him in dread
but he paid no attention to her as he strode out of the cage
fraham the other
the enemy whom he must destroy
his supersensitive ears could already hear fraham coming down the hill returning to the house
but he did not fear the other now he knev with cold confidence that he was his match
the haggard wildeyed girl also heard now and cried a warning
ross hes coming
go out and get the pistol if you can be silent he ordered her
as her eyes met his commanding gaze she was mute and stricken
in his new mind sherill felt only contempt for her ignorant babbling
as though he needed a primitive toy like that pistol fraham stepped into the door a huge figure as tall and superhuman as himself
and gloving eyes saw him and realized in an instant what had happened
you youve changed too he cried
well well see whos master he swung up the deadly tripodal weapon he carried
the woman screamed
drop that weapon ross ordered calmly eyes were meeting glowing gaze beating against glowing gaze a contest of two superminds more deadly than the clash of swords
fraham was still raising his weapon but more slowly now
slower and slower his hands moved as upon his brain beat the superhypnotic command to desist
then hands stopped stiffly holding the tripod
he was putting every bit of his own brains colossal power into the hypnotic gaze with which he was battling the commanding eyes of the transformed ross sherill
the two supermen stood silent in the room that was utterly still except for the spasmodic sobs of the crouching girl
they were engaged in a terrific battle of minds such as earth had never held before
then almost imperceptibly the terrible eyes of fraham wavered the merest trifle
his mind before it had been projected a million years ahead in development had been inferior to the scientists
and now that development also had been jumped forward ten thousand centuries his mind was still inferior was slowly breaking down before the scientists will
slowly the hands of fraham lowered
in his eyes was an awful agony of searing hate and fury
yet he could not keep his mental defenses from crumbling before the others assault
drop the weapon repeated ross sherill coldly his godlike face unchanged in calm fingers relaxed and the diabolical tripodweapon rattled to the floor
step into the projector ordered the transformed scientist his gaze never flickering
as he understood the meaning of that command eyes became terrible
hellfires of furious revolt a flamed in them a surge of terrific mental resistance
but commanding gaze held steady beating the other down again with hypnotic command
a hoarse strangled sound bursting from his lips the huge figure of fraham moved stiffly across the laboratory and into the tall cage of the projector
sherill still holding the other with his eyes followed
his hand found the switch of the evolution reversing force and snapped it shut
blue radiation burgeoned from the bars wrapping great form in a shroud of azure light
ross sherill watched immobile as the projector hummed for minute after minute
the crouching girl was staring stunned at the cold awesome beauty of his inhuman face
then sherill flung open the switch
the blue force ceased
and there in the projector stood fraham not the transformed mighty superman but the wizened ratfaced little criminal
he staggered out dazedly wildly
i he faltered and sank into a dead faint on the floor
sherill felt a touch on his sleeve
it was the girl that savage atavistic female thing looking up into his face
ross you conquered him you brought him back and kept him from destroying the world she cried
now enter the projector yourself
let me bring you back to the man you were my husband
bring him back
drag him back across a million years of development to become a semiape like herself to become again cramped of mind and body an unclean primitive animal
no every thought in brain revolted at the idea
he wouldnot give up this tremendous power of brain and body this supermanhood hed attained
he couldnot
the girl seemed to read his thoughts
you promised ross she pleaded
he shook her off coldly
what had he to do with this savage creature
outside lay a world that only his great brain could put in order a world waiting for him to be its master here was much for him to do in that world a race to be forced into new cleaner ways of living war and greed and trickery to be stamped out
he could do all that ross
somehow that cry of heartbreak made him stop at the door
something in his inmost fibers something still strangely bound to this savage creature was stopped and held by it
ross its gail gail she was crying to him
you must enter the projector for me
his relentlessly clear mind told him that this woman was seeking to drag him back into a state of savagery like her own to take away forever his wonderful mind and body
yet something deep within him something not to be controlled even by all his tremendous mental power made him move slow step by step toward the cylindrical cage
at its very edge he hesitated feeling stronger than ever that sick repulsion at the thought of returning to a halfanimal state
please ross
he stepped very slowly inside the cage of bars
with a choking sob the girl threw shut the switch
when the blue reversing force stopped it was ross sherill not the transformed godlike figure of before but again the lanky young scientist who stepped out of the projector
he looked bewilderedly from the unconscious figure of fraham on the floor to the girl who was running madly toward him
ross youve come back she cried face was aghast
why i remember now i didnot want to come back to you gail he said
you looked like an animal to me looked repulsive apelike he held her tight
god what an awful thing that projector almost released on the world he whispered going to destroy it and never build another
whatever power has decreed the slow rate of human evolution knows better than we men knows that if we tried to go too fast upon that evolutionary road we would only destroy ourselves of an exciting sensational drama of the little worlds that no man can see
a complete novelette by author of around the universe trapped in eternity etc i the flower box i the fourth sector of the north atlantic airway the westbound night plane with mail and fifty passengers was in trouble
a fuel leak had been discovered drop down on pontoon four the chief pilot said delay us much
queer the radio man said canot get a word out of somers and alden
pontoon lay glistening in the moonlight
a little emergency landing field fifty by a hundred and fifty feet
a metal raft raised on its pontoons alone here in the atlantic
the moonlight gleamed on its flat metal expanse
at one end was a small metal shed the supply house
at the other close against the lowrailed side of the raft stood the little cottage where the pontoonkeepers lived
there were two of them two young americans roy somers and george alden
the cottage was a singlestory structure entirely of metal silverglistening alumite
this night of june 20th was calm
the sea was placid
the officers and passengers of the distressed airliner gazed down at the somnolent empty pontoon
its beacon lights were burning
the windows of the little cottage glowed with yellow illumination from within
but where were roy somers and george alden
they should have answered the radio call
very queer the radio man said
there ought to be more than somers and alden here
only an hour ago i had a message from the eastbound inside a tiny flower box somers and plane
it stopped here
put off two passengers relatives of alden
an hour ago nothing had been wrong here
the flyer had brought old professor alden and his daughter anne from new york
they were george father and sister who were to spend a few days on the pontoon visiting him
and the chief pilot of that other plane had reported something else
was it a reptile from the prehistoric ages a serpent hundreds of feet long
shortly after leaving the pontoon a passenger was found to be missing one jose toro who had come aboard at new york
he was booked through to london but evidently he had left the ship at the pontoon
very strange
five people unaccounted for
the pilots searched the pontoon
they got their fuel from the storehouse
there was no sign of disorder
nothing wrong
they searched the little metal cottage
its door had a smashed lock
nothing else was wrong
the few small interior rooms showed no signs of violence
the luggage of professor alden and his daughter stood as mute evidence that the guests had arrived
the officers of the mail plane reported the condition of pontoon by radio to new york and to london and in ten minutes they departed
perilous manhunt
when they were gone pontoon still lay silent and deserted
drama had been here tragedy doubtless but it was over now
but was it
on the floor of the kitchen under the low southern window stood a little flower box
it was a box only a foot wide two feet long and hardly six inches deep
soil was in it
a geranium flowered at its center
it seemed to have been neglected
was only recently watered
nothing of tragedy and drama going on here now
no sign of life here on this deserted metal raft
here in the flower box a little sign of life showed an ant in one corner wandered disconsolately over the dirt looking for food
but what of that
anyone here now staring at the little flower box would have concluded that there was nothing to see
fatuous reasoning
who ever thinks of the amazing realms of smallness always under our eyes teeming always with drama and tragedy
this little flower box for instance hour and a half before the distressed westbound flyer landed at pontoon and found it deserted roy somers sat with george alden in the kitchen of their metal house
alden had just come from his radio instrument in the adjoining room
the eastbound plane is landing here alden said
roy what do you think father and anne coming to spend a day or two
his face was flushed his dark eyes sparkled
the big blondhaired somers was excited
good lord what news
your father and anne somers could think only of anne
coming here now
anne who through all the lonely days and nights was so constantly in his thoughts
in ten or fifteen minutes alden said
what a surprise
get busy roy got to get this place slicked up
the plane from new york landed swiftly discharged professor alden and anne and quickly departed
to somers it was like a dream having anne here
he clung to her hands
a smal slim darkhaired girl her face like his was flushed
roy youre hurting my hands he released her hands in confusion and turned to her father
professor alden was a small frail greyhaired man in his sixties thin and wiry like his son george
somers picked up the suitcases but there was one small satchel which the professor insisted on carrying himself tell you about it later he said discovery of mine
anne began cooking supper
the professor and his son crossed the raft to inspect the supply house
somers joined them
but after a minute or two he wanted to be back with anne
he left them unceremoniously recrossed the metal field in the moonlight and approached the little metal cottage
the door was closed
strange
he had left it open just a few moments before
then he was stricken by the sound of a voice
not voice
and i am here
i want to be with you
the voice of jose toro
somers recognized its suave spanish accent
he had met this toro
a young latin american chemist who in new york was professor assistait
somers had never liked him
for one thing he was far too attentive to anne
but jose i thought you were on the plane going on to london but got off
there is something a sudden jealousy had made somers pause by the door
there was a small hallway inside beyond which was the kitchen
anne and toro evidently were there
the voices were muffled by the closed metal door but still they were plainly audible
jose the girl obviously was startled
jose let me go
anne was almost screaming with terror
the house had several windows all of which were open
somers leaped for one of them
the heavy metal hurricane blind came snapping down in his face
and all the others slid closed simultaneously all of them electrically operated from a switch inside the house
and there was muffled voice stop fighting you little fool
dios
i do not want to hurt you back at the door somers frantically pounded lunging against it but it resisted all his efforts
and the metal window blinds vere the same
the little house was impregnable
mingled with screams of protest again came voice adventure for you and me eh ninta
no one can catch us now to the raging somers the voice seemed to have a new quality
softer
dimmer
behind somers young alden and the professor came dashing up breathless
that fellow toro somers gasped
here inside here with anne the voices inside were steadily growing fainter
get a crowbar george break the door it seemed an eternity while they waited and somers raged and plunged at the resisting door
then within a minute young alden came rushing back with the heavy iron bar
the voices inside were very much dimmer now queerly far away in sound
but they could not escape from the sealed metal house
somers thought that triumphantly as he seized the crowbar and bashed in the door lock with a single blow
they rushed inside
it seemed to somers that just then he heard faint terrified cries
but the place was empty
somers dashed through the rooms
anne he called where are you
he dashed from one little room to the other
searching frantically the sealed house was empty
i the kitchen the trembling professor alden straightened from the floor
his small satchel was in his hand
he set it on the table
it was open
somers saw rows of tiny metal vials some red some white
he has stolen some of my drugs my great discovery the professor said somers and alden stood gasping listening
amazing diabolical plot of this jose toro
amazing thing of science this which now the professor was so vehemently telling
as the professors assistant toro had helped for the past two years in the old mans chemical researches
revolutionary research successfully ending with an amazing discovery
a drug to shrink every tiny atom of the human body cells
to reduce in size every atom of any living organism
uniform dwindling so that the shape the identity of the complex cell agglomerations remained unchangedand only the bulk was altered
the professor gasped out his astounding secret as with trembling fingers he searched his satchel of vials
a drug for reducing the mass of a living organism
and a drug which was its opposite to increase the mass increase the bulk
incredible thing
somers stood confused
incredible
yet it explained this disappearance of anne and toro
incredible fantasy
yet here it was
somers mind tried to encompass it
anne and the villainous toro had been here but now they were gone
but theyre not gone
professor alden was saying right here of course
gone from us in size but right here somewhere have to take the drug
make ourselves small find them somewhere here the professors hands shook as he gripped his little vials roy george thats what anne and i came to tell you
i thought we might make an experiment here never yet tried this with a human
only with insects he held one of the red and one of the white vials
the red for dwindling
we must hurry be gone so far into smallness he suddenly checked himself
somers saw an expression of horror sweep his face
on the floor there was a sound of scratching
the rasp and scuttling of insect feet unnaturally loud
for an instant the three men stood chilled with horror
they saw the thing now an oblong black thing down on the floor of the room over by the window
the bright light from the overhead electric bulb illumined it clearly
an ant six inches ong
it stood belligerent on its bent legs
the professors voice broke the tense silence
he toro must have dropped a pellet of the enlarging drug
this ant licking at it donot you realize
it seemed to somers that his heart stopped beating
the ant was visibly enlarging swifter always as though every moment its rate of growth was accelerating
its multiple eyes glared
it reared erect
roy
kill it
the old professor was terrified into a panic of confusion
the thing eluded them
long glistening black shape pinched in the middle like an hourglass
it disappeared through the broken outer door out to the moonlit expanse of the pontoon
roy my god roy george
somers and young alden leaped past the whitefaced old man
at the outer doorway all three paused
the professor gasped got to kill it let it swim away escape it will devastate the vorld
out in the moonlight near the center of the glistening metal landing field the hideous thing stood poised
only an ant somers stood with cold horror clutching at his heart
the damnable thing was growing larger
what would its size in an hour be
swimming the ocean reaching shore
a monster with no limit to its growth perhaps
again the ant reared itself erect
its eyes glowed phosphorescent in the moonlight
and then it dropped horizontally
belligerent with the realization of its size it came scuttling forward
the fight with the ant somers the brief terrifying combat was a fantasy of horror
he was aware of the hideous thing advancing
enormous insect now
it advanced lusting to seize these upright enemies who stood regarding it
somers heard the professor give a terrified cry and dart sideward
but young alden jumped forward
the ant reared to meet him
they grappled and alden toppled backward fell with the ant down upon him
somers reached for the heavy iron crowbar wdth which he had bashed in the cottage door
he seized it leaped forward just as young alden fell
and somers swung the iron bar
it struck the huge blackshelled body
there vas a sickening mashing crack a noisome stench of sticky white ooze
the back of the giant ant was broken its pinched middle sagged its whole mangled length writhed
with his senses reeling somers stooped and jerked the fallen young alden away
the insect lay writhing as tnough in a death agony
young alden had rolled away and was climbing to his feet
somers had dropped the iron bar
he turned and picked it up to strike again
too late
amazing strength of this ant strongest living thing of its size in all the vorld
it reared its mashed and mangled body
it seemed gigantically to leap with its broken legs
somers head reeled he was barely aware of what was happening
he saw professor alden standing nearby the huge mangled insect leaping upon the old man seizing him bearing him away
somers and young alden all at once found themselves futilely despairingly in pursuit
the giant ant held the old mans bodys aloft and with it scuttled and lurched across the moonlit metal surface
the professor screamed a brief scream of agony
somers flung the bar
it struck the ant mashed it again
doubtless now the thing was dying or dead
but the momentum of its huge body and the blow of the bar slid it forward
the low guard rail of the pontoon was near at hand
the noisome gigantic mass of shell five hundred feet above somers heaved the boulder down full at head and puip still gripping its victim slid and crashed through the guard rail vanished over the edge
there was a drop of thirty feet to the placid moonlit sea
a silent interval of horror then one final splash
tough george
somers murmured done for forgotten anne got to do something
they turned and ran
to somers came the irrational thought that now in the kitchen they would seize this damnable jose toro
but sight of the empty room brought somers to his senses
how could he seize toro and rescue anne
yet they were here somewhere frantically he and alden poked about the little room
but there was nothing to see and only silence responded to their frantic calls
silence and the tramp of their own footsteps the grind as they shifted chairs and tables and the faint lap of the calm ocean against the walls of the pontoon
a sudden thought struck somers which turned him cold with horror
he gripped his companion
my god george we canot do this trample them if theyre here small under our feet they stood transfixed almost afraid to move
somers tried to reason what must have happened
this jose toro with his unwelcome attentions to anne toro had known professor secret of the drugs
toro had left the plane hidden himself on the pontoon
watching his chance he had got into the house stolen the drugs and the girl taken her into the realm of smallness
but where were they now
what part of the room
alden was tremblingly opening the satchel of drugs
two vials missing it looks like that he said
these others red and vhite father said the red ones for smallness didnot he
somers remembered it
each seized two of the vials
alden locked the satchel again
somers opened his small red bottle
a score of tiny red pellets were inside
but how many were they to take hey could only guess
one perhaps for normal shrinkage
they decided to take only one each at first
and add others later
but as they became small in which part of the kitchen would they search
somers mind tried to envisage the coming experience and it set him gasping
why to a human tiny in size this kitchen would be expanded into a gigantic realm
one might run across the floor and be minutes reaching the opposite wall
minutes if one were small enough it might be a days journey
a vast realm of smallness here with toro and anne wandering in it
then somers thought of something else
toro must have dropped a pellet of the enlarging drug
that ant had eaten some of it
the ant what was an ant doing in this metal kitchen on the metal pontoon in the middle of the atlantic
the little flower box
somers cried know where they may have gone alden knelt with him on the floor beside the flower box the overhead light shone strong upon it
look roy
look
alden murmured
amazing sight
down there on the caked dirt half hidden by the tiny fuzz of growth two little figures were plainly visible
toro and anne
he was carrying her inert body in his arms
tiny human figures
a quarter of an inch high no more
toro carrying anne
struggling laboriously through the growth of grass blades
dwindling figures
already they were smaller than a moment before
the grass far taller than head almost hid them
a vague instinct made somers reach down
but he checked himself powerless
how could he seize that tiny human form no bigger than an ant
his descending hand suddenly seemed monstrous his thumb and forefinger were incapable of grasping the minute figures
breathlessly he and alden crouched stared down threading advance had moved the grass blades but now he was too small for that
he staggered with body moving between the blades without touching them
was anne dead
somers could not think so for the fleeing toro then would have abandoned her
she had fainted probably
then he knew that anne was not dead
the drugs were effective on living organisms only and body now was dwindling equally with her captors
toro came out of the grass
so small a eighth of an inch high
certainly no more than that
and it seemed that as somers bent lower to look toro was gazing up with a waving arm in gesture of defiance
almost invisible now
somers blinked
he heard alden mutter gone
no
still there
somers was almost sure he saw the tiny moving speck which was toro and the pinpoint dot of bluewhite dress
there was a tiny ridged crack in the caked dirt smaller than one would make with the scratch of a fingernail
it seemed that the moving specks had dropped into it vanished
somers breathed again
and then he tensed
george he murmured give me a match donot dare look away
i donot dare
somers continued to stare at the spot
his groping hand took the match from alden
then he bent lower and very carefully stuck the match upright into the dirt a half or threequarters of an inch from where anne had disappeared
carefully he memorized the direction
two pellets
would that dwindle them quickly enough
he stood with alden both of them pale and tense
they held the pellets ready
somers nodded to alden and simultaneously they swallowed the drug
somers instinctively closed his eyes
he was conscious of an instant sweetish queerly aromatic taste in his mouth
his senses reeled with a dizzying swoop
descent into smallness omers opened his eyes
the sense of swooping dizziness persisted for a moment and then clarified into a semblance of normality
he found alden clinging to him
you all right roy
yes
only i feel a queer tingling sensation
they were seated together on the kitchen floor with upraised knees and feet drawn close to their bodies
the little flower box was in front of them
to one side were the legs of the kitchen table with its level top above their heads
suddenly they were conscious that the whole scene was in motion
the walls the ceiling everything in the kitchen seemed to be slowly shifting
a queer steady crawling change
slow at first like the hands of a clock whose movement is barely perceptible
but the change was obvious
ever5tthing was expanding
and the movement was not only visual
they could feel it now
the floor was crawling outward under them
it drew their feet out so that their knees shifted down with tiny jerks
they had to hitch themselves into new positions to maintain balance
amazing but after a moment they found the physical strangeness passing
they stood up clinging together with the floor shifting under their feet pulling their feet apart so that every moment they had to take a step inward
and the movement was accelerating
a weird change was taking place
the table legs were huge
the table top was higher than their heads
the flower box seemed to have doubled its size and it was no longer near them
six feet away now and shifting crawling steadily further into the expanding distance
somers laughed grimly
got to keep our wits not get rattled
yes
i think wed better go over there
they started walking
the sensation was strange but in a moment they got used to it
six feet to the flower box
they took a few steps
but the box was drawing away
they ran
the wall of the box was at their shoulders when they reached it
a shoulderhigh green fence
they scrambled up over it tumbled in a heap onto the dirt
somers saw some six feet away a round white pole sticking up waisthigh
the match another few feet beyond it would be the place where anne had gone go there yet
somers warned too big
might trample her
for a moment they stood with the waisthigh grass blades expanding around them
from the edge of the box there was a drop of thirty or forty feet
the kitchen tabletop was a monstrous plateau a quarter of a mile away and high in the sky
sky
no the wide expanse of ceiling was still visible as a blur above them an expanding fading blur
the electric light bulb up there was a distant spot of white glare
how long they stood engrossed somers did not realize
then he swung about his heart pounded with alarm
the white matchstick was a great pole eighteen or twenty feet high
and it was thirty or forty feet away
beyond it very distant over the huge grass fronds a great towering shape was visible
somers moved to where between the twentyfoot leaves of the grass he would see that towering shape clearly
a crooked pillar of browngreen towering up hundreds of feet to a blurred mass of red
the geranium
a lake of muddy water was at its bottom
alden too was staring in amazement
and suddenly he was gripping somers
things moving
my god you see them
the world of the flower box
steadily with a constant acceleration it was opening up
and there were things alive here of course
with a trembling hand alden was pointing at the expanding tower of the geraniumstem
things alive on it
they were too far away now to be distinguished clearly
but undoubtedly there were moving living beings
a new world here
and in it time was lost size was lost
size and distance always changing
everything growing swiftly gigantic and moving away into newly created realms of distance
then suddenly somers became aware of the matchstick again
it was a gleaming white column now
it towered two hundred feet into the bluewhite blur of sky
and it was at least four hundred feet away over the tumbled expanse of dirt and rock somers went cold
the column was receding so fast
could they reach it
somers ran with his companion floundering after him
four hundred feet
he knew he had run that far but still the gigantic white column loomed ahead
then panting almost winded they reached it ran around its huge curving side
this way somers panted
toward the geranium
the geranium plant was only a blur in the distance with a gleaming radiance shining upon the watery expanse at its base
somers headed toward it
another desperate run
amazing realms of smallness miles of rocky cragstrewn waste ridged and pitted little gullies opening
they leaped over them
they stumbled fell picked themselves up and ran on
roy wait i canot all out of breath
somers stopped
despair was in his heart
they had waited too long
they could never reach that crack
alden came panting up
take it easy got to keep together got to reach that crack
alden smiled grimly
if were too small we can get larger you know
no need of all this running he added
both realized that the tumbled area of rocky distance had lost its movement
the drugs action had worn off
they peered into the half light
rocks were strewn here now
gigantic green stalks rose into the sky behind them the grass blades
memory came to somers
this was the place where toro had stood carrying anne roy look off there
somers followed the gesture
a mile or two away the rocky ground suddenly burst upward
an earthquake a monstrous cataclysm
it shook them with the rocks shuddering under their feet
a distant upheaval
the ground rising as though by a vast explosion
yet it was a slow upheaval
a pushing upward
a mountain of earth rising a hundred or two hundred feet into the air and falling back into a huge tumbled litter of broken rock
the roar of it came echoing from the distance a queer crashing roar blurred and muffled
they stood gazing transfixed
the earth had been pushed upward by a monster coming up from underground
a mile or two away but still they could see the gigantic shape
was it a reptile from the prehistoric ages a monstrous serpent hundreds of feet long
they could see it slithering twisting coiling itself then lengthening out moving away until in a moment it had vanished
somers turned to his companion
he tried to laugh
the tension of his taut nerves made him feel suddenly hysterical
george do you know what that vas
my god no worm wriggling up through the loose dirt
a worm in the flover box
astonishing aspects of size
size to govern ones viewpoint of everything that monster only a miserable little worm
why here in the vial of drugs in his pocket was his ability to get large again to change that distant fearsome monster back into a harmless wriggling little worm
somers felt into his pockets to make sure that the vials were safe
he recalled the professors brief words concerning his drugs an aura which they flung about the living organism they were altering an aura like a magnetic field so that his clothing and the small articles in his pockets were within its influence
yes the vials were sate
he laughed grimly sure got to keep our wits george
this can be handled better than were doing it
they were planning to take some of the enlarging drug and then they saw what was obviously the crack into vhich anne and toro had vanished
it showed now as a yawning shadow across the landscape about a quarter of a mile away
come on somers said
easier to walk there than to take any more of the drug
they started
somers was pondering what procedure toro might have followed
one dose of the drug would have worn off now
had toro taken more hey came to the crack
stood awed
it was a long broken gully
a great ridge of upflung earth was here on the plateau of its upper brink
they stood on the tumbled summit gazing down
if they went down there somers said dubiously suppose we ought to climb down
the descent did not take them long
they stood presently on the guliy floor with the broken walls towering above them
the twilight was deeper here
the sky was a ribbon of greyblue haze
silent rocky desolation
their low voices echoed with a queer muffled quality
but where have they gone
alden was saying
roy how can we ever find them
there were plenty of rocky recesses here where toro might be hiding
somers took a step then checked himself shuddering
anne might be here at his feet tiny as an ant
his gaze swept the stonelittered gully floor
george whats that over there he said abruptly
a little crumpled white thing ten or fifteen feet away
they went and picked it up
it was a small square of white linen smelling faintly of perfume
in its corner was a small embroidered handkerchief
had she dropped it here by accident or was it a trail which she purposely had left for them to follow
they were here somers said evident
i believe anne dropped it purposely
she may have marked this spot here for us to show that this is where they took the second dose of the drug
they consulted
then each took a second red pellet
the sensations were not so confusing this time
crawling shifting of the enlarging landscape
the handkerchief grew monstrous
a great billowing mass of white fabric
presently it was higher than their heads
the strands were like plaited rope
the billowing folds were ten feet high
then twenty feet
george
look here
alden was stooping
on the shifting ground which every moment was growing rougher more broken there lay a bent black wire
it was several feet long and rapidly enlarging
one of hairpins
no mistaking it
the trail into smallness
brave little anne she had recovered from unconsciousness
she was alert now leaving a trail for them to follow
and the deduction of another fact was easy
this monstrous hairpin in another moment it was longer than somers body still was far smaller than normal compared to the gigantic crumpled mass of the handkerchief
anne and toro had dwindled here
they had taken the second dose of the drug
and they were not moving very far in space only in size
we must keep ourselves here somers said until this dose is worn off
i doubt if theyd take a third one
again he envisioned the enormity of smallness
this was only two pellets
with others one might go down and down into infinity
every tiny widening crack here at his feet held new gigantic realms if one were small enough to penetrate them
every tiny grain of rock in this vast valley held a new universe of smallness
at last the drug again wore off
somers and alden stood regarding a great tumbled white hill
a thing indescribable
billowing folds of shaggy white ropestrands woven into a titanic fabric
it stood piled into a huge mass fifty feet or so in height with a spread of an acre or more
a score of entrances to the dark recesses under it were near at hand
cavemouth openings and in one place a yawning oval ten feet high
somers and alden stood peering into the inner darkness
was the trail lost
there had been no other sign from anne
were she and toro motionless now
hiding somewhere here wonder somers said just wonder that cavern in there from the yawning opening ahead there came a muffled scream
a cry of protest
terror
defiance voice
with alden after him somers dashed forward plunging into the blackness of the cavern
combat of size i had seemed dark under the vast billowy folds of the handkerchief
but when he got inside somers was at once aware of light
a reflected sheen from the fabric itself and a dim effulgence from the rocks
he had noticed it outside in the gully a while ago a glowing dim phosphorescence
swiftly he and alden dashed forward their eyes rapidly becoming accustomed to the softer light
the scream was not repeated
quiet
somers murmured
got to locate them
he had stopped and stood clutching alden
they listened peering
a glowing labyrinth here
rounded shelflike recesses in a dozen places of the cavern walls
and all of it plaited rope strands so coarse a fabric that they could have climbed its rounded slopes
no sound
eerie phosphorescent darkness
dios
give me that voice
the sound of a scuffle
and then they saw toro and anne
two figures seemingly of normal height
they were standing about fifty feet away on a shelflike recess of the fabric wall some fifteen feet above the rocks
toro in white shirt and dark trousers anne in her paleblue dress
both mudstained with clothes torn by the journey
they stood on the ledge struggling the man gripping her cuffing her
dios
give me that wonot kill me if you like i wonot go any further they had not yet seen their pursuers
anne quite evidently had seized a vial of the drugs
he was trying to snatch it from her
the realization came to somers as he and alden dashed forward
he was aware that up there on the ledge anne had jerked loose her arm and flung something away
the vial of diminishing drug
it hurtled through the air and fell to the rocky floor
toro shouted an oath
and then he saw his oncoming enemies
somers already had reached the slope which led to the ledge
he leaped upon the rough fabric climbing it
toro seemed stricken with astonishment
he stood defiant thin dark face livid with rage
his hand darted into his trousers pocket
the vial of the enlarging drug
fiendish triumph distorted his face as he swallowed a pellet
and abruptly somers saw that he was groving
a slim latin american
but already he was six feet tall
alden was shouting after him
kill him come with you let him escape with that drug in that second reason came to the stricken somers
he fumbled in his pocket
the vial of enlarging drug
take it quickly
match this fellow in his growth
and he swung and shouted at alden you stay here take care of anne no both of you get large not so dangerous but keep away from me fight him
somers crammed two pellets into bis mouth
a sevenfoot toro leering with the triumph of his growing bulk stood up there now
then he turned jumped backward down another slope and vanished
somers head had reeled from the drug but almost at once the feeling passed
he was aware that the eerie phosphorescent scene was shrinking
the fabric of ceiling was coming down the walls closing in
these closing walls it startled somers into a panic of confusion
he stood tense clinging to the slope of the fabric
but its surface was smoothing the spaces between the ropestrands were closing on his fingers
he could feel the surface bending under his weight
and suddenly he slipped saved himself from falling by a backward leap
he had thought it was a drop of nearly ten feet but it seemed only two or three
he got his balance stood wavering
on the dwindling rockground across the cavern lay anne with her brother holding her
dwindling figures already they were no longer than somers arm was a blur of movement as toro made a rush through a narrowing sidepassage
somers scrambled after him
the shrinking fabric wails scraped him as he wedged through
panting he got outside turned and beheld the small tunnelway through which he had emerged
it was hardly big enough for his hand
dios
got you now
he swung around as the figure of toro leaped upon him
they grappled
somers mind was alert
above everything he knew he must keep his wits
the shock of weight made him stagger backvard purposely he went limp sagged and fell pulling his adversary down upon him
and then with a sudden lunge twisted and brought himself uppermost
he found toro perhaps a foot larger than himself
stronger undoubtedly
but both quite evidently had taken two of the pellets
it seemed that there was no relative change in size
he and somers were enlarging with equal rapidity
somers found himself straddling chest
the fellow was lunging squirming flailing with his fists
around him somers was aware of the dizzying swooping scene
all shrinking
rocky walls of the valley lowering and closing
and almost at his side was a crumpled white handkerchief
he was gripping throat and toro with his breath shut off was choking his eyes bulging
but tire sight of the shrinking handkerchief set somers shuddering
it seemed with that instant glance that he saw the tiny figure of alden carrying anne trying to run
realization swept somers
at any instant his leg or the flailing legs of the prostrate toro might mangle those tiny running figures
he cast toro off
he leaped erect
stooping he snatched toro sideward
barely in time
it seemed that the handkerchief was almost under somers feet
the double dosage of the drug had confused somers so that he scarcely thought of combat with his human enemy
but toro had lunged to his feet
he stood panting and then he jumped again upon somers
they wrestled fought with wild scrambling blows
somers felt the thud of fist upon his head face was close as he panted can conquer the world with these drugs
i dropped some of it but i have plenty left you have to do for me first somers retorted
but his adversary was strong
he was bending somers backward now his weight pressing his dark saturnine face leering with triumph
somers felt himself backing against a rocky wall
incredible for beyond shoulder there was another wall advancing
and toro saw the danger
he mumbled with startled horror
his grip loosened he jerked away
somers free recovered his balance
god
these closing walls
this was no valley in whicn they were fighting
no more than a narrow rocky trench a few feet wide and shoulderhigh
horrified realization swept somers
in another moment his gigantic bulk would be mangled here between these rocky sides
he saw toro make a leap and scramble upward
the ditchwalls vere pressing but the upper surface had come down to somers waist
he jumped drew himself up and rolled out
it seemed that the slit of rock was closing like a reptiles mouth trying to seize his emerging legs
the upper surface familiar undulating dirt and rocky terrain lay spread in the distance
as somers staggered erect dizzy with the dwindling scene again the murderous toro came at him under the giant folds of the handkerchief anne and her brother saw the enlarging form of toro rush away and the gigantic somers after him
alden was aware of the danger
he lifted anne
can you walk
i guess so better now
got to get outside get away be too large might trample us
an amazing scene encountered them as they ran outside
a combat of giants they saw the fallen toro somers astride his chest choking him
men twenty feet tall
now thirty feet
in another moment alden realized these giants would trample the handkerchief
the sweep of one of their legs would presently encompass a hundred feet of this rocky ground
anne was limping with a twisted ankle
alden picked her up carried her running to escape can take the drug now anne murmured
foolish of me to be afraid of it
put me dovn better take it george
he thought so too
the gigantic trouser legs of somers and toro great svaying pillars rising into the air lunged back and forth
dizzying mammoth blurs in the gloom
the enormous bodies were blotting out the sky
suddenly the titan shapes lifted upward and were gone
alden and anne each took a pellet of the drug
the valley closed in on them
they scrambled out to the surface
the giants were still fighting
there was more light out here and they were plainly visible
it seemed that now they were fully a mile away
they swayed locked together
five hundred feet tall
it seemed so
then they went down rolling lunging
then up again staggering with mammoth strides
and then anne cried oh look
dear god look at roy somers had been beaten to his knees fists were raining blows upon him
then suddenly as though with supreme effort somers was erect
one of his arms dangled behind him
the watchers saw that the dangling hand held a boulder
and somers heaved it aloft and crashed it down full on head
there was a breathless moment while toro stood wavering
the boulder dropped with a great roar to the ground and somers staggered back panting
a breathless instant
then the body of toro fell forward came toppling crashing down
for a moment its thousandfoot length writhed and twisted
then it lay still with the mammoth figure of somers bending over it
tiny arena omers bent down panting over the fallen body of his antagonist
toro was dead
no doubt of that the smashed weltering head was mute gruesome evidence
and there vas other evidence in that moment somers was aware that the motionless dead thing was dwindling
death had checked the effect of the drug
he stood now swaying over toro
the body had seemed perhaps seven feet long
he saw it shrinking now
the whole rocky terrain was shrinking
vague distant blurs of monstrous shapes were dwindling coming closer taking familiar form
why these tremendous green stalks they were blades of grass
that giant yellowwhite pole that was the matchstick somers hastily retreated
he must keep away from that matchstick
alden and anne might so easily be trampled
minutes more of the shrinking landscape
and every moment it was more familiar
that great red blur in the sky that was the geranium blossom
somers turned the other way
the great green stalks were thickening around him
hardly higher than his head now and he pushed his way through them
presently he was wading in them with their tops lower than his waist
he came to a kneehigh parapet with an abyss beyond it and a great blurred vista of open distance
but the blurs off there were taking form
the monstrous blurred spread of surface off there so high and far away came down and shrank and showed itself to be the kitchen table
somers stood peering over the brink of the flower the vastness of the kitchen floor seemed a hundred feet below him
but soon it was fifty twenty
he swung over the edge
for a moment he clung dangling by his hands
a drop of ten feet
he let go
landed on his feet
the wall of the flower box dwindled to his shoulders
the action of the drug was wearing off
somers sat on the open kitchen floor until the movement of the scene had ceased the little flower box was here
two feet long a foot wide six inches deep
he bent anxiously over the small spread of dirt peering waiting for anne and her brother
they came at last
tiny figures enlarging
shoving through the grass climbing as he had climbed over the side and out of the box
carefully he lifted the tiny sixinch figure of anne and set her on the floor but the dizzying swoop of his carrying hand left her gasping
at last they were together again and all things assumed their normal proportions
moonlight streamed in through the open window of the darkened kitchen
the placid summer ocean rippled with silver
somers sat with anne beside him
alden was in the adjoining room at the radio sender think somers said out of a silence that the drugs should be destroyed
too dangerous
and the flower box the drugs are in it
destroy this flower box the girl shuddered
yes
poor father
concluded on page science questions and answers his department is conducted for the benefit of readers who have pertinent queries on modern scientific facts
as space is limited we cannot undertake to answer more than three questions for each letter
the hood of correspondence received makes it impractical also to promise an immediate answer in every case
however questions of general interest will receive careful attention
editor science questions and answers i was surprised the other day to find that the chemical formulae of cane sugar and milk sugar are the same this seems a little odd since they are different in sweetening power
from what little chemistry had i always understood that different substances must have different formulae
gloucester virginia
the study of sugars and related compounds belongs in the realm of organic chemistry the compounds of carbon
the incredibly numerous compounds containing carbon are all due to the latters remarkable ability to hook up with almost anything in chains rings and other formations
all sugars are basically of the foimula given above but each is put together in a different way with resulting differences in taste appearance and chemical activity
if the atoms in a general sugar molecule were arranged merely by chance there could be different combinations
only a few dozen are known however
in organic chemistry the formula above means nothing
it simply indicate the proportions by weight of carbon hydrogen and oxygen
for a true indication of composition the organic chemist uses structural formulae which show exactly how the molecule is put together
he can show by the change in position of atom why this sugar and that are quite different
as a typical example common alcohol has the same formula as methyl ether which is poisonous
when we look at the chemists structural formulae ve see how they are different
alcohol is methyl ether is this difference in hooking up makes all the difference between a liquid which can be drunk and one which cannot besides many other differnces

editor science questions and 
answers how is sleeping explained
when our brain sleeps why do not the heart or lungs do the same
brooklyn the phenomenon of sleep has lately been much clarified
intensive biochemical research has revealed that there is a rhythm to life
it pulsates much like a wave
the pulsations are periods of activity and rest
activity drives all the bodys chemical processes in one direction toward fatigue
this state is characterized by the presence of excess phosphates in the blood
to complete the cycle the organic organism must have rest
this allows the chemical processes to reverse and prepare for another stretch of activity
fortunately however nature has provided that our heart and lungs have a different system of rest periods than our brain muscles and bodj cells in general
this was necessary because the animal organism cannot survive any extended period of rest for the heart lungs and stomach
these organs work and rest pulsate very rapidly
after each heartbeat the heart rests for a fraction of a second
after each breath the lungs take a short nap
the total amount of rest in a days time for the heart is about the same as that we give our bodies when we lie down and sleep

editor science questions and answers what is all the discussion on the canals of mars about it definitely known whether they are there or not
one would think such an easily observed phenomenon would have been settled long ago madison wisconsin
strange to say the authenticity of the martian canals has not been proved
in shiaparelli vho was admittedly sharpeyed announced that he saw fine line markings on mars which he called canali
unfortunately that italian word is far too suggestive when transposed to english
shiaparelli meant channels not manmade canals
since bis time the discussion has waxed furious
famous astronomers corroborated his discovery
equally famous ones denied their existence
lately it is becoming generally credited that no such regular and numerous markings occur as shiaparelli and and lowell claimed to see
experiments conducted in the laboratory indicate that the human eye and mind have a tendency to connect faint spots and markings by wholly imaginary straight lines
in the case of viewing mars in a telescope the image is very hazy at best
it literally takes a conscious straining of the eye to distinguish even the larger markings
the socalled canals being at the limit of visibility may be subjective imagined rather than objective seen
photography has failed to reveal the mythical canals
but the claim is made justifiably that under the best of conditions the eye is more sensitive than the photographic plate so there is still no positive evidence on either side
perhaps the only sure check on this engrossing question will be when man finds a way to traverse space and explore mars himself
ed
editor science questions and answers noticed that the filterable viruses are being called living liquids as in the farley story recently
science fiction aside are they truly alive
san francisco calif
strictly speaking the answer is probably no
filterable viruses seem to be more of the quality of subtle poisons than of living matter
it seems that some diseases like the mosaic disease of the tobacco plant and silkworm jaundice produce a lethal substance which is able to interfere with the metabolism of healthy tissue
unlike cultures of germs the virus is filterable through the finest of porcelain filters indicating that it must have a colloidal composition
whatever the substance is which can reinfect tissue with the disease that produced it it is not composed of the germs and microorganisms we know at present
either its potency is due to incredibly tiny living organisms matched in size by some of the larger molecules or to superpowerful poisons which in undetectable quantities can poison a mass of protoplasm unthinkably greater in mass
measles and scarlatina in man are on page world8 moat perfectly developed man if vou had only days to live doctors said you had only ten days more to live
what would you give to have another ten of life
anything in the world you would say
unfortunately it would be too late rvhlle you have many years more to live i8 the time to fortify yourself against later troubles

by fred miles here are orchids for two fine tales in the february issue of the world in a box by carl jacobi and the ice entity by jack williamson
though not as good as the legion of space the ice entity was a vastly interesting story
presented in the same issue as stort story it helped to make the best of the four numbers of the rejuvenated was very delighted to see a draving by jack binder in this issue
the yarn it illustrated was the third best in my favor for the month
the cover was excellent
almost photographic in its realism
keep up the good work
new providence new jersey
by john baltadonis story brain of venus takes the cake for february as far as concerned
the way it started out i thought for sure that the ending was obvious there i was waiting for the introduction of the heroine to marry captain brant when bango he gets killed
that in itself stunned me but vhen the second hero of the story got killed got to hand it to fearn for having enough nerve to write a story having two heroes and both getting killed
protoplasmic station by paul ernst wasnot as good as i had expected it to be
however it did provide good reading matter
invaders from the outer suns by frank long jr had a novel twist
ice entity was something new
black fog looked like just another death cloud story at first
only this time instead of a hero and heroine emerging victorious at the end mankind really is doomed
quite a surprise twist
i agree with ronald armitage on the subject of cartoons
why not pick a better subject
frankfort ave philadelphia penna
a by john hartos having just finished the february issue of i feel that i must write you in appreciation
carl story world in a box is the best story in the issue
the others too are good
zarnak by max plaisted is a good idea and a pleasant variation from the fiction content
the december issue rated pretty highly too
lanson screen and the brainstealers of mars by john campbell jr were among the best in that number
this is the first letter i have ever written to any magazine
center street hempstead new york
readers will be interested to learn that mr campbell has written more stories concerning the interplanetary adventures of his two intrepid spacerovers blake and penton
the first of these will soon be ready for publication
how about other firstletter writers sending in notes to this department
ed
by john chapman the february is the best of the four issues published up to now
if you keep improving as you have been youll soon reach the top
brain of venus was unusual
try to obtain more of his stories
wandrei comes second with black fog
these two authors are about the only ones who really know how to end a story with a wallop
instead of the routine procedure in which the fairhaired hero saves earth and lives to win the heroine etc etc fearn discarded the hackneyed ballyhoo and reversed the situation so that the hero sacrificed himself to save the entire universe
and no heroine either
judgment sun will be the third eando binder story you have published since august
by all means keep up that pace
binder is without doubt one of science fictions greatest writers and never be tired of reading his stories
some other authors like to see in are murray leinster nat schachner frank kelly and rowley hilliard
the illustrations are great
marchioni is the king of artists
keep him and donot bother about securing anyone else unless it would be paul
como ave minneapolis minn another binder novelette for you next month his best story to date
ed
by youd although i never wrote to the old magazine i am writing now to welcome the old mag back
it was with mingled feelings that i tore the wrapper off your december issue and saw that paul was gone
your cover artist is good however and like to see him alternate with paul
your layout is good
especially the forecast for the next issue how about a coming shortly feature
i am looking forward to all the stories announced for the next number
the outstanding stories in the december issue were the lanson screen the only good story ever read by zagat and was it good
the brainstealers of mars the funniest story read in ages campbell is a worthy successor to weinbaum
and of course the weinbaum tale brink of infinity
ringmaster was appealing mainly because of the uranian professor character have more stories about him
would like to see stories by miller hamilton leinster keller harris hilliard pragnell williamson and zagat if he can produce another like the lanson screen
desborough road eastleigh hants england
by norm sirirsger i was very glad to see the reappearance of your magazine on the newsstands although there is room for improvement

two other yarns the brink of infinity and the lanson screen were very good and took second and third places respectively

continued from page usual and new as was the ease with wein baums story
zagat told an old story with a new twist while cummings and hamilton took hackneyed but interesting plots and filled their stories with exciting adventures
so ended the good half of the magazine
as for the inferior stories they were by gabriel wilson
this story was good once but long ago well written though taking sixth place
echols story was formula stuff
static was too short and dry
now for some general criticisms
you should try to print a serial
a novelette should be at least sixteen pages long
keep your authors away from the timeworn themes is only published every other month
i believe that it should be published monthly or oftener
and here are bouquets has brought back many famous old authors to science fiction
cummings merritt farley kline burks theyre all good
the general run of your stories tend to be written in the principle of story first then science
this is a vise plan a story may be dominant in science and have an entirely new conception but it will fail to hold the readers attention because it is poorly written and then again a story may be well written and fail to click because the plot is too old
consequently your stories cover a larger scope because your requirements as to science content are more tolerant
my ten favorites are merritt burroughs cummings farley williamson burks leinster coblentz verrill and hamilton
six of these men write for you
keep them

by james wilhelm i have been a reader of your magazine for some time and like it very much
i have never written to you before but i need some information
i have been experimenting for some time with light and its peculiarities
outside of what few instructions came with what equipment i have still in the dark no pun intended
i would like to experiment with black light infrared and photo electric cells
also with electricity especially the more startling and amazing phenomena that can be achieved with the proper preparations would like to know where i can get information and equipment for these experiments
randolph ave elkins va
any public library should contain an assortment of books on light in the physics section of their science books
or you can consult the bibliographies mentioned in any encyclopedia after articles on light readers drop mr wilhelm a card if they have any information for him

continued from page the first place the cover is excellent
as a contrast to the past three issues the figures are lifelike and their faces express varied emotions
in my estimation the best tale in the issue was brain of venus
of the short stories world in a box is tops
he who masters time was also interesting
zarnak is terrible and i wish youd blow it to atoms you have the artist shanghaied
but now i have thrown enough brickbats so how about some friendly suggestions
would it be possible to enlarge the interesting science questions and answers
and hov about more of those very interesting questions in test your science knowledge
after reading some of your stories i found more material for questions that were untouched
the reader speaks is altogether too short
we fellers like to know what others think of i know all this is a big order to fill but by all means try to enlarge science questions and answers
fifth street washington there are seven questions and answers in this issue enough ed by irving koskow although the december issue of is the best of your three issues thus far there remain some minor imperfections
first and foremost take that comic strip zarnak out not only childish but silly
please bear in mind that many of your readers are not adolescents and constitute a goodly portion of your circulation
the space wasted on zarnak could be used to advantage in enlarging the reader speaks
i must congratulate you on the other departments and features
most noteworthy of these are story behind the story and scientifacts of mars was most novel and interesting of all the stories in the issue
there is but one correction like to offer concerning this story
granted that a type of animal such as described is capable of changing its protoplasm given a sufficient amount to vork with how could it possibly reproduce a spacesuit or bits of metal which are not organic from organic protoplasm
mutiny on europa was a fine tale on a par with yarn
fulton street brooklyn many readers like zarnak a battle going on about the strips merits
come on plaisted supporters lets hear from you
what kind of a plot would you want zarnak to have
your point about the campbell story is well taken but remember that the thushol did not create the space suits they stole them from the space ship
they could only simulate inorganic substances externally of course

editor science questions and answers albinos are explained as lacking pigmentation
how does this occur
can there be albinos of any animal
hartford conn
although no complete survey has been made it is undoubtedly possible that there can be and have been albinos in every species of animal
white blackbirds white crows white swifts white rabbits white rats and such are well known where the original stock is heavily pigmented
in albinos the factors for pigmentation have been lost in the intricate nuclear combinations which occur in the ripening germcells
in the case of an animal with one of the dark pigments melanins it is necessary for a ferment tyrosinase to act on a pigmentproducing substance called tyrosin
if either factor drops out of inheritance the fertilized eggcell develops into an albino
the phenomenon is comparatively rare because the pigment cells are hardy in the biological sense being closely related to skin cells which are toughest of all
there is also a form of albinism which is acquired rather than prenatal
cases have been observed of animals such as chickens changing from black to white or move rarely of human hair whitening overnight
in such cases of false albinism the pigment matter can be found to have moved to a new locale as for instance the liver
it is depigmentation rather than nonpigmentation

editor science questions and answers is there a direct connection between the motions of the moon around earth and earth around the sun
if so why doesnot our calendar indicate that the true month is onethirteenth of a vear
superstition salt lake city utah
there is no mechanical connection between the separate orbital motions of earth and moon
if the moon were miraculously to increase its speed of revolution by twice it would move outward from earth but earth would not change its periods of rotation and revolution noticeably
by coincidence the moons period of revolution divides almost exactly thirteen times into a year
the ancients tried their best to work the moonperiod into the year with indifferent success
in the heydey of roman civilization no two people agreed as to the year since the first of the caesars
julius caesar with the aid of a competent astronomer established in the calendar bearing his name which is in use today except for the modifications made by pope gregory in julius success in making a calendar that lost no more than three days in years was due to his disregarding the period of the moon entirely which is incommensurable with the year

editor science questions and answers i donot believe personally that a cat has nine lives but heard some wild stories of how cats survive all sorts of deaths and lots of people believe in it
now lets see what a scienceeditor would have to say about it besides plain bah
long branch a cat has fundamentally one life and one only
one bullet in its brain will kill it as suiely as it would any other creature
but the cat does seem to have a special tenacity for that one life
for one thing it has by long evolutionary processes developed to perfection the art of always landing on its feet
this faculty measurably increases its chances for longevity
then it has those richly innervated long hairs or whiskers in its cheeks which apprise it of danger in the dark upon contact
added to this is an ability to see in depths of gloom in vhich most other creatures except owls and bats are totally blind
it also has the homing instinct strongly developed which enables it often to reach safety and shelter when stranded
physically it has a highly developed efficient body well protected from teeth to claws
its senses of smell and hearing are very acute
and lastly it has far more intelligence than is generally suspected
its seeming dumbness is a camouflage for a firstclass thinking organ
all these points in its favor taken together give the cat a distinct advantage in the grim game of eluding death
it is questionable whether even the anthropoids with their semihuman intelligence have greater survival value than the felines
only man with his guns and snares has the power to rob the cat family of prestige in the iunele

the wars of the future will be fought if at all in the atomic laboratory
and its a safe bet that the harnessing of atomic energy will be discovered only by accident
throughout the history of science accident has been the important agency responsible for uncovering the great scientific wonders
for example in berthold schwarz was attempting to find a compound for making the philosophers stone
all of a sudden his table of chemicals exploded on him
gunpowder was discovered
in an italian doctor named luigi galvans quite by accident came upon a dramatic scene which gave us electricity in circuit
galvani noticed that vhenever his electric machine began to spark between electrodes a frogs legs he had freshly dissected lying on a metal plate began simultaneously to twitch as though it were alive
by hanging a dozen frogs legs to dry by copper hooks on an iron grille he played with the idea of animation again and the whole line began to move even the aid of the electric machine nearby
thus current was born
and so it will be in the future

if a person is actively interested in science fiction he goes to any extremes within reason of course to stimulate interest in the type of fiction he loves
in ray three years of scientifictional activities i have employed various methods of introducing science fiction to the general public
at school in my english class i often devote my oral to sclentifiction
many of my written compositions are also based on science fiction
of course there are those who scoff at my choice of reading matter but i have interested quite a few hitherto antisolencefictionists

concluded from page a monster it had killed its creator
again somers and anne were silent awed by their memories
the little flower box stood here before them
the moonlight through the window streamed brilliantly down upon it
little arena
small spread of caked dirt with a fuzz of tiny grass and a forlorn geranium at its center
what amazing realms of smallness lay hidden here the match still stood with a tiny scratch in the dirt beside it
a few inches away toward the geranium the dirt was softer
there was a tiny broken mound
somers mind swept back
a worm had poked itself up there and then wriggled away
he bent closer
even now he could distinguish the body of toro
a speck on the dirt near the upright rnatchstick
and as he stared he saw two tiny black ants struggling over the ridges of the dirt
they came upon the tiny speck
they stood for a moment picking it apart
and then they carried it away
