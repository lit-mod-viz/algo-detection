only those who see the end could any light the mystery lend 
but time have stop -PRON- mouth with dust long since to earth -PRON- do descend 
from the silver light

but -PRON- pure and deathless love throughout the aeon will extend 
til no man be leave to stand where desert cover sea and land 
and fob of even the jackal cry 
the breeze alone blow oer the sand 
ihe instant chuok dove into the slime of the pool -PRON- realize -PRON- be in trouble 
crawler slap -PRON- sucker into -PRON- skin eager for -PRON- blood 
but -PRON- momentum carry -PRON- deeper and -PRON- be too late to stop 
-PRON- see the faint glimmer of the shoe in the red haze of the water 
pull -PRON- out of the mud -PRON- swam upward until -PRON- break the surface 
then -PRON- be quickly out on the grass roll over and over to scratch off the small crawler -PRON- stand up shake the water out of -PRON- shoe moxita come over and favor -PRON- by pull out the remain crawler that -PRON- hadnot roll off 
but -PRON- still wasnot speak to -PRON- 
not after what have happen last night that damn guatoeat 
all this trouble 
chuck dewitt wipe the mud off -PRON- shoe and slip -PRON- on 
finish with the zipper -PRON- smile hopefully at hoxita but -PRON- be still mad 
-PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder and go back into the tent -PRON- would recte the day before lloxita follove -PRON- in silence 
slowly -PRON- begin to pack and -PRON- pack with -PRON- 
-PRON- be a good wife even if -PRON- be a boondooker 
chuck think that the green tint of -PRON- skin add something to the natural lithesome beauty of -PRON- race 
but these mad spell of her -PRON- irritate -PRON- 
-PRON- whirl at -PRON- -PRON- be only a guatooet for cripe sakel good guatooat -PRON- correct 
and -PRON- have to chase -PRON- away by throw a shoe at -PRON- -PRON- may not come back 
iell all for that chuck say sarcastically fling a pair of dirty sock into one of the pack 
-PRON- buckle the strap and toss the pack onto the levitator platform a stupid religion -PRON- persist worship big oatsl lloxita didnot reply dhe lapse behind -PRON- wall of silence 
and -PRON- wouldnot speak -PRON- glance at -PRON- another hour or so 
-PRON- mad spell often last two day 
but chuck know that -PRON- be falsely accuse -PRON- ihe cat werenot symbolic nor even remotely connected with religion 
boondock woman like the big tawny thing and boondock man seem to hate -PRON- and chase -PRON- away whenever possible 
chuck could easily understand why like last night the big oat have prowl near -PRON- tent and create so much racket with -PRON- scream that -PRON- hadnot be able to sleep 
so -PRON- have chunk a shoe at -PRON- to chase the thing away 
the shoe have plummet into the pool 
-PRON- be too far back to the city to get another pair so -PRON- would have to dive into the pool for -PRON- old one 
guatooat be big trouble all the way around 
-PRON- take the guide rope and float the platform out of the tent then begin to break down the plastic structure 
toxita help -PRON- dutifully 
everything be pack and -PRON- move out onto the jungle trail 
for a while koxita walk behind -PRON- 
but -PRON- soon tire and climb upon the platform 
chuck be a bugtrapper 
-PRON- make the round twice a month in -PRON- territory and sell the brittle bug shell to the hospital on earth 
when boil down via chemical process into a liquid state the sticky substance that form the bug outer shell be a positive cure for the common cold -PRON- tend one trap take the horn bug out of the statis field trap and kill -PRON- then slimg the carcass aboard the platform lloxita who love -PRON- inspite of the time when -PRON- be mad at -PRON- scoot over to make room for the shell 
-PRON- sneak a loving glance at -PRON- strangeworld wife 
lately -PRON- have come into -PRON- mind to have a son 
of course -PRON- wasnot easy to get the idea over to lloxita 
twice -PRON- have try -PRON- but well -PRON- d also mention -PRON- to harper the old trader who operate the shell marketdome down by caix lake and harper have say rather embarrassed to take -PRON- wife with -PRON- on -PRON- next round of trap 
chuck be do now 
but advice be not succeed because -PRON- seem that lloxita be stay mad at -PRON- 
after -PRON- would throra that shoe at the guatooat toss -PRON- blanket outside onto the platform and that s where -PRON- would spend the night 
other earthman have child by boondock woman 
ho problem there 
proof of the matter be harper 
eighteen kid 
hope 
the only trouble be with lloxita and the guatooat s iearily 
chuck bend -PRON- head and stroll on down the trail 
haybe harper could advise -PRON- 
after last night 
chuck know something have to be do 
the way thing be go now -PRON- nerve would collapse in another week 
the day seem to pass slowly but -PRON- put -PRON- mind to the task of tend the trap and -PRON- wasnot until late in the evening that -PRON- notice the two guatooat slip through the dense fern that border the trail 
the big oat be seldom dangerous 
-PRON- resemble an earth tiger in some way except for the thin tentacle grow in a mass from the top of -PRON- head 
at first -PRON- wasnot sure but when -PRON- see one spring lightly across a small clearing -PRON- know -PRON- be follow -PRON- 
just to be safe -PRON- stop and take -PRON- proton rifle off of the platform blinglng -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder -PRON- feel more secure be at about two hour from now -PRON- say in direction ihe didnot reply 
chuck look at -PRON- wrist watch 
-PRON- be odd that -PRON- wasnot over -PRON- mad spell yet 
ihey seldom last this long 
woman i ihe guatocat seem to -PRON- do a good joh of keep up with -PRON- 
chuck notice because when -PRON- quicken -PRON- pace -PRON- be still there sometimes invisible but always present nearby 
-PRON- hope -PRON- wouldnot start anything 
there be a stiff penalty for kill one of the creature whether -PRON- attack -PRON- or not 
evidently if one attack -PRON- be suppose to run 
chuck have never hear of one of the cat attack a man but -PRON- would be damn if -PRON- would take any chance with one of -PRON- 
ihe oat seem to be creep closer become more courageous every minute 
-PRON- wasnot worry yet 
if thing come to bad -PRON- would climb upon the platform and boost -PRON- up out of reach 
time be a factor 
if -PRON- could manage to reach the clearing at the cat would wander off 
ke glsince back at iioxita dhe seem to be in a trance with the slight fringe of a smile play about -PRON- lip 
-PRON- be tug the platform around a curve in the trail when -PRON- come face to face with one of the guatocat 
the big tawny thing be crouch ahead of -PRON- in the trail -PRON- tail make a circle ominously in the air tentacle wave furiously -PRON- stare at -PRON- 
the oat appear to be prepare to spring 
there wasnot time to get on the platform vith an instinctive motion 
chuck sling the rifle off -PRON- shoulder and bring -PRON- up and sight 
there be a hissing noise as -PRON- press the button and the big oat fall apart into tiny dust mote that settle slowly to barth moxita be scream as chuck dart forward in the trail to make sure that the other guatooat wasnot prepare to attack 
but the other guatooat have depart for place unknown 
so -PRON- run back to comfort ioxita 
-PRON- be cry uncontrollably -PRON- kill -PRON- -PRON- wail -PRON- kill a guatooat chuck be angry now 
uat at -PRON- for worry more about a damned oat than -PRON- and mad at -PRON- because of the stiff fine -PRON- would have to pay for kill the thing 
shut up -PRON- tell -PRON- 
viciously -PRON- grab the rope to the platform and with the rifle grasp firmly in -PRON- othdr hand -PRON- trudge quickly past the tiny pile of dead guatooat in the trail 
-PRON- didnot take much longer to reach -PRON- be anxious to get out of the jungle now and -PRON- be also worried 
moxita be have a nervous breakdown scream -PRON- head off 
at -PRON- could send for a doctor 
-PRON- be pant heavily when -PRON- break free of the jungle into the clearing before marketdome 
the platform inertia fling -PRON- to the length of the rope when chuck stop 
harper -PRON- white beard stream over -PRON- shoulder come run out to iioxita and help -PRON- down from the platform 
ilrs 
harper a kindly boondock woman be right behind -PRON- 
together -PRON- lead the still sob moxita inside the huge airconditione dome 
chuck be almost too winded and tired to move 
a moment later 
harper come back out of the dome 
-PRON- wear a troubled frown 
tllgodl -PRON- exclaim do -PRON- really kill a guatooat 
chuck still breathless be only able to nod -PRON- head 
for sake why i think -PRON- want to be a father fall -PRON- have damn sure spoil -PRON- chance nowl the oat be attack pant chuck 
attack rave harper swinge -PRON- gnarl hand 
-PRON- stare at chuck -PRON- eye flash rage 
then -PRON- begin to simmer down 
bor a time -PRON- just stomp around in the dust 
chuck be lean on the platform for support something harper have say be begin to dawn on -PRON- what have a guatooat get to do with have a baby 
chuok ask 
-PRON- have a fairly high intelligence ratio and be form ooaolusion that soar -PRON- 
harper didnot answer merely shuffle the toe of -PRON- shoe in the dust chuok moan 
boondock doesnot have a a trisexual race 
harper shake -PRON- head all -PRON- fault guess just take -PRON- for grant that -PRON- already know about the bird and bee look not go to let one of those damnea oats touch i donot give a bucket of blood if -PRON- never have any child oats only furnish atmosphere son harper explain patiently 
ever hear one scream fhat scream be a sonic nerve stimulent that do something chemically inside a woman 
ihen why do boondock man chase -PRON- away 
how would -PRON- like to have a hundred brat yap at -PRON- heel 
boondock woman require only two month in order to give birth to a new litter 
chuck do some rapid figuring fhat amount to about six child a year 
irong harper state shake -PRON- head 
depend upon the number of guatocat 
one oat around one child fwo oat two offspring 
jhen a boondooker want an offspring -PRON- go into the jungle and capture a guatocat with a stun gun and put -PRON- in a cage and take -PRON- back to -PRON- home 
bingo 
if -PRON- would tell -PRON- this before i wouldnot have shoot that oat 
how not only do i have a stiff fine to pay but lloxita to pacify probably stay mad a week 
how would -PRON- feel if -PRON- nerve have just be rip apart harper ask 
-PRON- shake -PRON- old wizened head but -PRON- be bad off than that son 
every time something like this have happen the gustooat refuse to cooperate from there on out never scream around -PRON- again 
but how could -PRON- know i kill one 
chuck ask just go capture one in the jungle on the other side of the city work 
somehow the oat know 
telepathic 
and that be the gist of the evening 
moxita soon regain some of -PRON- composure and chuck set out on the return journey 
unbelievingly -PRON- stun a guatocat and fasten a cage for -PRON- vhen -PRON- regain consciousness -PRON- be as harper have say the cat be morose and sit silently in -PRON- cage nay pass 
pay the fine hadnot hurt half as much as the real zation that -PRON- and uoxita could never have any child 
how that -PRON- have reason 
chuck check with a boondock doctor and what harper have tell -PRON- be relatively true 
week later -PRON- discuss the situation with harper when -PRON- be again in that territory 
moxita have grow sad chuck say lean across the counter as harper count -PRON- take of bug shell lapkitty wonot compare with a child say harper rub -PRON- in 
how be i to know 
could have happen to anyone harper justify often wonder say chuck all of -PRON- child look abont the same age 
why 
eighteen guatocat son 
one of the danger of live in the jungle like this 
all of -PRON- offspring be of the same litter 
well believe i be careful after that 
i have a couple police shepard bring in from earth to use as watch dog 
dog hate the big oat and the cat have little love for the dog 
the dog keep the guatocat away -PRON- yell chuck 
can i borrow one of -PRON- dog 
both of the original dog have die but sell -PRON- one of the pup three month later 
chuck again stop at the marketdome and yelled for harper to come out 
harper and -PRON- greeskinned wife go out into the dust and there sit moxita on the platform with a baby in -PRON- arm chuck be stand on the ground with the rope of the platform in -PRON- hand and a proud fatherly smile on -PRON- face 
ow in jupiter do -PRON- do -PRON- 
harper exclaim astonished 
earthman ingenuity chuck brag be blast 
-PRON- give -PRON- a clue the last time i be here chuck point out 
remember what -PRON- say about dog hate the big cat 
well i capture a guatocat and at an opportune moment put the dog into -PRON- cage 
that guatocat scream alright and loud 
chuck let out a laugh and hand harper a cigar 
so -PRON- see -PRON- continue like to buy another of -PRON- dog 
moxita and i have be think -PRON- may like a set of twin the next the painting be a monstrosity 
-PRON- be a swirl mess of green red and brown throw together into crude and obscene shape 
suggestibility be the keynote of the painting for one oould look at -PRON- for a moment and feel -PRON- imagination come alive with a hundred morbid dream 
the painting hang in john llosbys livingroom above -PRON- reading chair 
-PRON- have acquire -PRON- from an obscure aft dealer a month prior and for all -PRON- ugliness -PRON- enjoy gaze at -PRON- in the evening when -PRON- come home from -PRON- office 
there be a restful feeling in the brown shape a soothing feeling in the geeen and a relaxing feeling in the red 
probably -PRON- be the only person save for the one who have paint -PRON- who oould look upon the painting and enjoy what -PRON- see 
or rather what -PRON- feel 
the door buzzer hum at precisely seventhirty 
john llosby fresh out of the shower with the faint smell of aftershave lotion cling to -PRON- cheek carefully finish the knotting of -PRON- tie glance at the effect in -PRON- dressingtable mirror and feel pleased with -PRON- appearance 
for a bachelor of twosoore and seven -PRON- think still a handsome fellow 
-PRON- open the door and smile at llaria come in darling -PRON- say take -PRON- arm liaria return -PRON- smile and walk with -PRON- into the room 
-PRON- stop in the center of the room and kiss 
inria press -PRON- to -PRON- hungtily and for a long moment john liosby be lose in a strong desire 
when -PRON- reluctantly break -PRON- embrace john push maria away hold -PRON- shoulder and let -PRON- eye take in -PRON- body 
such a beautiful creature 
too bad i couldnot have meet -PRON- twenty year ago for all the good -PRON- would have do -PRON- maria laugh be only twelve 
i have brace on -PRON- tooth freckle splotch all over -PRON- face and i be abominably fat 
bo there well -PRON- would have make a go of -PRON- anyway 
john mosby throw -PRON- arm around shoulder and turn -PRON- around to face the wall upon which hang the painting 
-PRON- fling out -PRON- other arm palm up have acquire a priceless work of art 
how do -PRON- like -PRON- 
maria loke at the painting and for a while say nothing 
john mosby glance at -PRON- face and see a film of fear over -PRON- eye 
-PRON- arm still lie over -PRON- shoulder and -PRON- oould feel -PRON- shrink away from the painting 
finally -PRON- say john -PRON- hideous hot hideous just different say john mosby hastily see that -PRON- be genuinely upset by the painting 
how come on let eat some of -PRON- marvelous cooking then go sit mystify through a horror movie 
john mosby return to -PRON- apartment at twelve oclock 
-PRON- turn on the reading lamp and sit down to relive the past two hour 
marian body so near -PRON- own almost merge with -PRON- own 
-PRON- know -PRON- lipstick have come off on -PRON- shirt collar and the knowledge make -PRON- feel strangely youthful again 
maria william be indeed a lucky find for -PRON- year old -PRON- look and act morg like twentyfive unmarried with interest strikingly similar to -PRON- own -PRON- have come into -PRON- life two year ago at a time when -PRON- have relinquish -PRON- to the staleness of old age and bring -PRON- baok to life 
during the last two year john iiosby and liaria have enjoy a companionship that border on the sublime ihey seem to sense one another thought mood emotion -PRON- vere hold together by a bond of intimacy that neither of -PRON- could understand or explain lany time -PRON- say be just mean for each other and certainly that be true ihey have never cjuarrelle have never feel together 
always -PRON- look for and bring out the good in one another magnify -PRON- affection 
and yet -PRON- be not in love be a link between -PRON- as strong as any personal link could have hope to be 
-PRON- share -PRON- with one another -PRON- thought -PRON- hope -PRON- des pair but there be no love involve 
-PRON- seem that one be extention of the other and that without one the other be incomplete 
ihey have meet and -PRON- have come together and now -PRON- be fulfil 
in all way save one iheir inability to find love one for the other 
john mosby sit far into the morning hour before a weariness fall upon -PRON- and sleep cause -PRON- eyelid to flutter 
-PRON- relax in the chair stretch out -PRON- leg kick off -PRON- shoe 
hlowly -PRON- drop into a light slumber 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- be still partially awake for the sound of the room the ticking of the mantle olook the humming of the airconditioner the swirling of the color over the canvas above -PRON- head be greatly magnify 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- sink down into a warm mist which swirl about -PRON- and obscure -PRON- vision and render -PRON- body immobile 
the swirling of the color over the canvas above -PRON- head 
yes yes -PRON- could hear the color 
-PRON- could hear the red and the brown and the green 
the color sound so much different from the way -PRON- look but -PRON- know which be which 
the lifuid gurgling that be the red 
the rustle awkward scrape that be the green 
and the soft humming vibration that be the brown 
the sound merge creep across -PRON- mind spread through -PRON- body bring a warmth 
-PRON- havenot find love say the sound tug at -PRON- find only plsure and temporary fulfillment -PRON- whisper liaria give -PRON- strength but -PRON- can never give -PRON- love -PRON- murmur caressingly be no good for -PRON- but i be good for -PRON- 
i can give -PRON- love 
john hosby awaken with frightening abruptness 
the voice of the painting still echo in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- hand grip the arm of the chair and a great weakness hold -PRON- in -PRON- frigid grasp 
maria -PRON- say llaria 
the sound of -PRON- name be unpleasant 
maria 
the thought of -PRON- face of -PRON- lip of -PRON- eye that look into -PRON- own be somehow obscure 
the memory of take -PRON- into -PRON- arm and hold -PRON- so near -PRON- push -PRON- out of -PRON- mind 
rise from the chair -PRON- turn and look at the painting 
the red spiral and the green swoop and the brown undulation 
-PRON- flow and wriggle and contort across the canvas 
-PRON- shimmer and reflect the light dully and oarae alive with a thousand faint but perceptible movement 
-PRON- form soothing shape and tender shape and gentle shape 
-PRON- gace into the depth and see a core of softness that beckon so irresistibly that -PRON- could not deny -PRON- 
the reason i buy the painting john llosby thought be because i want love 
the reason i buy the painting be because i feel that -PRON- contain all the love i could ever need or want 
i didnot knoww -PRON- at the time but that s why i buy the painting 
-PRON- have invite maria to -PRON- apartment that night as -PRON- have often do in the past ostensibly to share with -PRON- a large dinner -PRON- have prepare for -PRON-

-PRON- would find out soon enough 
john moshy oroase the room and pick up the telephone 
-PRON- dial apartment and vaite for -PRON- to answer 
all the while -PRON- watch the painting voice come from the receiver sound very sleepy 
this be john maria sorry to awaken -PRON- at this hour but there s something important i must tell -PRON- 
the painting form many shape stretch out the color and snap -PRON- back move curl contorting 
-PRON- could hear the color move softly be -PRON- darle 
maria ask and -PRON- be infuriate by the innocent tone of -PRON- voice 
surely -PRON- must know 
the color be move faster now become impatient for -PRON- to say what must be say and get -PRON- over with 
-PRON- watch -PRON- fascinate by -PRON- subtle change overwhelm by the surge of warmth which pass through -PRON- body cause -PRON- to ache pleasurably with an inexplicable passion have call to say goodbye john llosby say the painting maria say that hideous painting

i canot understand how a painting a hideous painting like that could take -PRON- all away 
the room be alive with the sound of the painting and john mosby wonder if maria could hear -PRON- also 
-PRON- swell in soft murmuring caress -PRON- whisper gentle word that be not word at all but wondrous sensation 
if maria could hear those sound -PRON- would know or -PRON- should know what a marvelous thing the painting be 
hurry call the painting

-PRON- drop the receiver back into -PRON- cradle 
-PRON- wouldnot hurt maria too much ohe wouldnot miss -PRON- for -PRON- own self but -PRON- would miss -PRON- for the particular sameness that have hold -PRON- to -PRON- 
john mosby stretch forth -PRON- arm and start across the room toward the painting while the room swell and pulse to the rhythm of love that come from the painting in beat wave 
the color change shape again and again and a single form finally solidify and become a face 
pull red lip and soft green eye and dark brown hair 
a complexion that be light and clear and radiant

btallg begin why be -PRON- that so many science fiction writer and editor fail to inform -PRON- of some of the simple rule of english composition 
-PRON- neednot know the more obscure one -PRON- arenot expect to recognize the vocative case when -PRON- use -PRON- or the remnant in english of the instrumental case but -PRON- should be able to write clearly without confuse the reader by error in grammar and vocabulary 
instead of follow ambrose exhortation to write -PRON- right -PRON- write -PRON- rough and leave -PRON- that way 
but the genitive case for instance be something -PRON- should recognize understand and know to form 
nevertheless the placing of the apostrophe be a frequent source of error 
-PRON- be often find in the possessive pronoun our -PRON- yours and her and i be confidently expect to find -PRON- some day in -PRON- 
the possessive character of these word reside in the word -PRON- just as in -PRON- thy thine etc -PRON- be not impart to -PRON- by the addition oi with an apostrophe to denote some omission 
yes the apostrophe even when use to form a possessive do indicate an omission 
the original fora of book be johnne -PRON- boke by change in spelling and the elision of an h this later become johni boke and still later book a corollary feminine form such as jane book do not appear because at the time the language be be form woman do not own property 
another error which appear to be common to science fiction author be the inability to distinguish between lay and lie i should almost be willing to say that i have never see lie use correctly in science fiction 
but there isnot really anything difficult about -PRON- 
all that be require be to know the principal part of each verb and to remember that lie be intransitive -PRON- never take an object and that lay be transitive -PRON- must have an object -PRON- must lay something somewhere and no joke please probably the confusion arise from the fact that the past tense of lie look and sound the same as the present tense of lay 
however the follow table be memorizable in five minute and should have be memorize in grade school by anyone who consider -PRON- a sufficient master of the language to be a writer by dr raymond wallace infinitive to lie down or abe past past perfect present participle i lie down i have lie down i be lie down infinitive to lay somet he own or anywhere past past perfect present participle i lie -PRON- down lay -PRON- down i have lay -PRON- down i be lay -PRON- down all there be to -PRON- nothing more be require 
the verb to lie repose should not be confuse with the verb lie 
to tell a the latter verb 
principal part -PRON- lie lie lying be quite a different word with a different etymology 
present i lie down present should know what a predicate adjective be and use -PRON- when require rather than use an adverb 
so say that someone look badly do not mean that -PRON- look unveil -PRON- mean that be vision be faulty lo say that -PRON- feel badly do not mean that -PRON- be depressed or ill -PRON- mean that -PRON- tactile sense be defective 
if -PRON- feel bad say so 
if there be uncertainty over the proper form of a particular word substitute another in the construction to see what form -PRON- should take 
ihere be no confusion over the differ meaning of look anxious and look anxiously host science fiction author do avoid the use of a double negative when only one be require but -PRON- be not so skilful in avoid a triple negative when -PRON- want only a double fhey seem to be mislead by the fact that a negative construction sometimes use word which by -PRON- be not recognizably negative can not help but go be a common example of three negative where only two be want 
xhe intend meaning be that -PRON- must go but not help and hut be all negative in this construction 
a double negat -PRON- have make a positive a triple negative be equivalent to a single negative 
-PRON- can not help go be a correct form of the intend expression -PRON- can not but go be another a little stilted nowadays perhaps but still serviceable 
a particular source of error among writer of science fiction be the confusion of a certain group of word with other which be similar in sound or appearance even though in some oasis -PRON- may -PRON- opposite in meaning 
ihis be nothing but fuzzy thinking and a science fiction author in particular ought to keep -PRON- wit keen 
sxarnple be wrack and rack flout flaunt livid florid wreak wreck torturous full uls ome noisy noisome exercise exorcise and many more 
a writer ought no to be content ne rely to co nt inue use a word in what -PRON- suppose to -PRON- -PRON- meaning 
-PRON- should be -PRON- goal over a period of year to look up in the dictionary every word -PRON- use not only for -PRON- precise meaning and other possible meaning but for -PRON- derivation in order to understand the subtle connotation arise from -PRON- etymology 
youthful wit raconteur and gay blade bs stand far out and away from the more oonservative member of -PRON- teenage gang
