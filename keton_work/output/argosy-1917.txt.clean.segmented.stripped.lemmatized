and guanama have give hemmett carman fernandez for wife which be good of all 
mr hemmett then listen to the superb united state piano in -PRON- drawingroom and to the laughter of edward hemmett jr age three and yawn gloriously 
north america be all right but south america and guanama in particular be well 
steve girton be happy here too although -PRON- have not see much of steve lately 
girton to be sure live right here in the hemmett home but most of -PRON- day be spend at the war office and most of -PRON- evening lately have be spend somewhere else 
mr hemmett frown drowsy amusement at -PRON- own lethargic mental state 
steve have mention dine somewhere but where 
not that -PRON- be worry because stephen girton be capable of take care of -PRON- in guanama or anywhere else 
hemmett stretch -PRON- leg and drowse through another hour to rouse at the sight of mr girton -PRON- 
or be steve -PRON- 
latterly -PRON- have be silent and preoccupy now -PRON- seem to vibrate and glow in the darkness 
latterly -PRON- have use many undertone now -PRON- shout -PRON- 
ne 
wake up 
eh cry mr hemmett happen go to marry -PRON- go to marry -PRON- 
mercede voice drop in something like awe 
mercede tesoro 
be that a fact 
hemmett be wide awake and stare at -PRON- 
-PRON- doesnot seem possible do -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- may be possible hemmett chuckle 
if carman be willing to marry -PRON- there s no real reason why the next most beautiful girl in guanama shouldnot marry -PRON- i suppose but say i do congratulate -PRON- old man 
carman will be tickle to death too 
-PRON- say something about -PRON- and mercede and i pay little or no attention but well by thunder -PRON- be guanaman now in good earnest arenot -PRON- 
for the rest of -PRON- life i guess mutter mr girton with the strange solemnity that have come upon -PRON- 
silence follow for a little the heavy comfortable silence of two man who understand each other perfectly 
hemmett be think pleasantly of the luck that have come to -PRON- old friend girton thrice start hum a little native lovesong and thrice catch -PRON- and stop 
and then -PRON- own thought stray in the direction have take -PRON- muse after a time -PRON- isnot a bad place to live -PRON- life all thing consider 
i suppose -PRON- look more like heaven to -PRON- just now than anything else hemmett chuckle but -PRON- not so bad at that 
-PRON- have sortie rousing adventure here in the good old day but thing be quiet now and forevermore at peace with -PRON- and the world and if -PRON- have only reelect ferrata president everything would be perfect 
briefly stephen girton leave the rosegarden of -PRON- personal thought 
how in blaze do -PRON- ever elect altara anyway -PRON- demand 
nobody ever think the radical party have a lookin everybody assume that ferrata could serve for the rest of -PRON- life 
but -PRON- jam in altara by a hundred vote and hell make a rotten president 
-PRON- will that hemmett agree 
-PRON- seem timid abotit -PRON- own shadow 
-PRON- darned inauguration yesterday be rush through like a wedding ceremony in an alderman office 
but -PRON- be just as legal and bind girton grin 
a lot of those vote for -PRON- come down from carama way where -PRON- have build the uniformmanufacture city 
i know theydid say hemmett and a lot more come from the ricoto neighborhood and the new factory there and if -PRON- come down to that the heavy altara vote in any one region come from the section of this very town where the employee of the national engine work live 
that go perfectly solid for altara 
and here -PRON- stare at each other in gentle astonishment until girton smiled do -PRON- suppose there s any connection between the two thing 
have -PRON- various new big employer of labor be influence -PRON- employee to vote out ferrata 
i doubt -PRON- hemmett say slowly 
although this whole industrial boom be rather queer to -PRON- mind 
almost anything queer be likely to come of -PRON- 
why just see what be happen here at this minute steve new factory be furnish million of dollar worth of supply every month to the european army thatjuld be make more cheaply and buy more cheaply in the united state and carry to europe more cheaply after -PRON- be make and say a fact isnot -PRON- cry mr girton 
well although i have never give -PRON- much serious thought until the last week or so -PRON- be unquestionably a fact be so infernally busy with the tobacco business that never consider the matter until very recently but -PRON- be a fact that certain european nation be pay more than -PRON- need to for the stuff make here 
why 
well for that matter why do all the money flow in and why do all the factory start up at about the same time 
-PRON- all begin two year ago 
-PRON- all begin about the time that certain of -PRON- senator decide that guanama need a big navy and jam through the proposition in the face of all kind of opposition 
girton speak suddenly and second by second the languor of recent month leave -PRON- countenance just as -PRON- be leave -PRON- all begin about the time that canita the confound pacifist go up in the air and decide that the harbor here need a fort big enough to defend two panama canal and jam -PRON- through the senate too 
in fact the whole business now that i think of -PRON- seem to begin at once 
a long halfminute -PRON- gaze at each other through the gloom 
stephen say hemmett have -PRON- be suffer from the native tendency to hookworm of late year 
have somebody be put over something that get by -PRON- altogether be wonder that without mention -PRON- ever since i realize that altara have be elect without a reason in the world for elect -PRON- 
and so have steve more particularly since the infernal radical party get a majority in the senate as well as a president 
and what s more oh bosh nothing to -PRON- i suppose 
girton laugh shortly queer all the same -PRON- persist 
so be all the factory crop up so suddenly 
so be the national engine work with what must be seventy or eighty million dollar worth of capital at least 
what be the concern anyway 
ostensibly a mighty corporation partly native organize for the purpose of turn out the most perfect form of turbine engine 
-PRON- must mean business steve buy up hundred of acre out there on the point opposite the fort and pay tremendous price for the land employ thousand of man and yes and why be -PRON- wall off 
why have -PRON- a fifteenfoot fence about the whole place with guard at every gate 
why be every man in the shop swear to secrecy 
because hemmett say mildly -PRON- be manufacture an engine on a device that be still a dead secret because patent have not yet be issue in several country 
that isnot necessarily criminal even if -PRON- be a bit odd 
but -PRON- break off suddenly for -PRON- native butler be at -PRON- elbow 
a messenger senor for the sefior girton 
-PRON- wish to see senor girton -PRON- 
send -PRON- here that gentleman say briefly 
the man depart to return with another native of guanama some thirty second later 
the visitor be a strange small and slim and immaculate in -PRON- linen -PRON- proceed straight to girton and smile and bow extend an envelope 
from the senor altara -PRON- president senor -PRON- purr 
if there should be an answer i will convey -PRON- 
-PRON- back away while girton whistling softly switch on one of the electric light set in the little tropicalfern jar at -PRON- elbow 
whistle still -PRON- rip the envelope and draw out the official sheet and be -PRON- say that -PRON- even continue to whistle as -PRON- read and then stop whistle 
what exclaim stephen girton 
what be -PRON- 
hemmett ask quickly 
another ten second girton give to a rereading of the document before -PRON- look up angrily 
well -PRON- be a more or less courteous little note fire the secretary of war -PRON- state bounce money money through history one find many secretary of war who have be disrhisse without undue excitement for all that -PRON- learn to the contrary most of -PRON- take -PRON- calmly enough but as -PRON- chance steve girton have form for guanama the only real army that country have ever own 
by hard persistent work -PRON- have weld straggling individual straggle unit into as compact a little fighting force as the heart could wish 
when -PRON- appear on the street people cheer the passing of official automobile periodically the paper have laud -PRON- and resolution have be pass commend -PRON- work invariably -PRON- light wish have be respect by lawmaker and -PRON- be human 
there be an answer senor ask the messenger 
-PRON- bet there s an answer the retired secretary of war cry 
-PRON- tell -PRON- ratfaced little president to go to the devil and find some one else who will give steve 
hemmett cut in sharply 
-PRON- may not be dignified but cease to be an official and i donot have to be dignified 
girton snap not in love with -PRON- but i know what do with this army business 
if be ask to resign in the usual way have call -PRON- politic and resign and charge -PRON- up to the justly celebrate ingratitude of republic 
but this thing simply a statement that i be dismiss and that -PRON- tenure of office come to an end when read this letter 
altara -PRON- write that 
hemmett cry in amazement 
with -PRON- own hand 
i have see -PRON- senor the messenger break in placidly 
stephen girton look -PRON- up and down 
-PRON- go back and tell -PRON- that resign -PRON- say bitterly 
and if -PRON- want to go by the door instead of be kick over the edge of this terrace go quick 
i donot like -PRON- face and mad 
the little whiteclad man vanish 
hemmett laugh annoyedly 
that be childish steve 
maybe so snort the exsecretary 
-PRON- wasnot the job -PRON- 
-PRON- have plenty of money -PRON- know that 
-PRON- be the idea of the thing and the way -PRON- do -PRON- and the infernal thanklessness of the whole proposition and and -PRON- queemess 
hemmett nod what impress -PRON- first -PRON- say 
only yesterday the novedade have an editorial on the possibility of a new cabinet and mention the impossibility of get a secretary of war in guanama who could even continue -PRON- work and once more -PRON- stop for once more -PRON- little butler be approach 
the senor enrico ricoro -PRON- announce 
to see -PRON- both senor 
together girton and hemmett gaze at the butler 
the the rich ricoro the latter ask 
the tobacco ricoro 
the same senor 
send -PRON- out here then hemmett direct and when -PRON- be alone again direct a puzzled little smile at -PRON- old friend about the queer thing of the day isnot -PRON- this call 
i suppose that ricoro be in the deadly enemy class 
-PRON- have be ever since the mess when -PRON- try to merge -PRON- tobacco interest with ours girton muttered 
-PRON- canot be two week ago that -PRON- give out an interview to the effect that the ricoro combine would never touch psst 
ricoro be with -PRON- not the ugly grunt little guanaman millionaire of the past with every penny of -PRON- wealth tie up in tobaccoleave and -PRON- ego swell to several time -PRON- normal size but an oily bow person who beam pleasure unutterable 
-PRON- hold out -PRON- hand and girton and hemmett shake -PRON- wonderingly 
-PRON- draw up another of the wicker chair and proffer -PRON- case of really remarkable cigar 
-PRON- rub -PRON- hand happily and lunge into the business of the moment -PRON- an unusual performance in guanaman commercial circle which savor of the orient in most thing 
-PRON- be astonish that i come -PRON- chuckle 
pero one make mistake yes 
i have be in some thing foolish 
-PRON- be to forgive no 
consider -PRON- forgive ricoro hemmett say curiously 
pardon -PRON- be this just a social call or a business visit 
both if -PRON- will permit since i have come to -PRON- home senor ricoro say -PRON- engaging smile grow even broad 
to sit here on -PRON- terrace and survey -PRON- city -PRON- be wonderful 
to speak at the same time of pleasant little business matter that be well yet 
no 
i should say that -PRON- may depend on the business matter 
of a certainty chuckle the amiable gentleman 
and these senor i think -PRON- will find pleasant 
i come with -PRON- permission to buy of -PRON- the extensive tobacco interest so ably conduct by yourself 
to buy -PRON- 
for cash senor 
ricoro go on smoothly 
why fence senor 
-PRON- know i know that the plantation have cost -PRON- perhaps one million and a half dollar united state 
and -PRON- have be pay dandy interest on two million say girton 
and for that reason senor i come to pay -PRON- here and now in cold cash as -PRON- say two million and a quarter say the surprising ricoro 
shall -PRON- have the paper draw this evening and conclude the deal or may i call in the morning 
an explosion of dynamite in the center of the terrace may have startle -PRON- a little more but very little 
this be ricoro absolutely tobaccopoor as regard ready cash this be ricoro who have scorn -PRON- own splendid holding not two year ago steve girton kick foot in the darkness 
mr hemmett say simply nix 
i do not comprehend senor 
ricoro inquire a nice offer but i donot think well accept -PRON- 
for one thing -PRON- be not talk actual spotcash 
but senor cry ricoro 
before ten in the morning at the national bank of guanama the money shall be hand to -PRON- in gold if -PRON- wish 
aha 
and for another thing -PRON- donot care to sell here be more valuable than ever and when the tariff in the united state have have a few more change -PRON- go to be more valuable still 
the offer be not enough 
not nearly 
two million and onehalf say ricoro 
yes but what s the idea of -PRON- 
girton rasp 
have somebody find gold on the plantation or be tobacco go to join the performer in some way -PRON- donot suspect 
what be -PRON- 
-PRON- be simply that have prosper i wish to increase -PRON- holding senor 
after which ricoro wait silently give -PRON- the vague impression that -PRON- feeling have be wound while hemmett and girton converse in that wordless telepathic fashion that come now and then to man who have know and understand each other through many long try year 
ricoro be seek of course to give the affair the aspect of an ordinary big business proposition 
yet an intelligent boy conversant with guanaman affair must have know that -PRON- be well something else 
a clairvoyant may have be able to delve into brain and find the answer for -PRON- the certainty remain that if -PRON- holding be worth two and onehalf million to ricoro -PRON- hold the same value for hemmett and girton spring -PRON- suddenly and at first glance -PRON- look good ricoro say hemmett 
but be not trust magnate and be not use to sling million around like cigar frank to say that if -PRON- offer three million -PRON- should not accept this evening 
but when -PRON- have have a week to think -PRON- over but a week senor 
well 
why not 
the native draw a deep disappointed breath 
as the excellent senor say why not -PRON- echo 
still i have hope to close this evening 
-PRON- be a handsome offer senor 
-PRON- s so darn handsome that -PRON- make one suspicious girton smile with utter candor something so seductively lovely about -PRON- that -PRON- wouldnot close if -PRON- have a truck of gold in the street because -PRON- have live year in guanama 
-PRON- be final senor 
for this evening at any rate 
but after this evening slip from the remarkable millionaire as -PRON- bounce to -PRON- foot and shrug -PRON- shoulder disgustedly and as quickly smile again 
what about this evening 
hemmett ask sharply 
why be this evening the particular one to pay crazy price for tobacco 
ricoro spread -PRON- palm deprecatingly before -PRON- retreat behind -PRON- bland smile 
-PRON- be a trick peculiarly guanaman and bafflingly chinese 
-PRON- mean anything in the world or nothing at all 
in this case -PRON- seem to indicate that both of -PRON- be unduly suspicious of an inoffensive millionaire whose sole desire be to make -PRON- rich and when the smile have persist long enough to convince -PRON- that ricoro be do talk business -PRON- make a few perfunctory remark about nothing in particular and take -PRON- leave 
down the street -PRON- hear the hum of -PRON- depart motor 
mr grin be quizzical as -PRON- ask what in blaze do -PRON- make of -PRON- steve 
nothing at all unless some overwhelming trust be come down here to buy in all the tobacco of the country and ricoro s hear of -PRON- and borrow enough to corner the supply before -PRON- get here 
but -PRON- couldnot borrow two and a half million in one lump 
i know that muse mr girton and by the same token -PRON- and i know the country very well and i doubt if there s one man beside -PRON- esteem able to hand out that sum in cash 
through perhaps two minute -PRON- smoke and ponder something behind that offer hemmett announce 
something or other that have no immediate connection with the tobacco business 
eh 
sound silly but -PRON- isnot steve the result of live so long in guanama i suppose and have think about that queer election and the other queer thing this evening a reason for everything that happen in this little old world -PRON- boy and there s no visible reason for anybody want to take over -PRON- tobaccoland at fifty or sixty per cent more than -PRON- actually worth 
hence the reason invisible at the moment 
steve girton late secretary of war lean back in -PRON- chair and chuckle a little 
hemmett may be bristle with suspicion of an affair -PRON- could not quite understand but girton do not bristle at all 
not one hour back stephen have become engage to the most adorable girl in the entire universe and when one be in just that state -PRON- be rather hard to bristle at intangible thing 
i think -PRON- be all off ne -PRON- say quietly enough 
i think ricoro have a brainstorm of some kind and believe that guanama be about to monopolize the earth tobacco market 
what -PRON- have actually dqife be to form a little group of wealthy man make up a pool of two million and a half and -PRON- voice trail off 
for the third time in a few minute little butler be with -PRON- 
mr william jone -PRON- announce this time 
again to see -PRON- both senor 
jone 
hemmett echo rather loudly 
what jone 
hush 
girton say quietly the mystery jone ne must be for -PRON- name william the chap who land last month and have be live on a whole floor of the new hotel ever since the fellow that ride around in the big white car -PRON- bring here with -PRON- hear of -PRON- 
what on earth do -PRON- want of -PRON- 
why not have -PRON- here and find out 
girton laugh 
mr form appear in the light doorway and move toward -PRON- 
hemmett switch on another light or two and examine jone as -PRON- shake hand 
very well dress very conventional of feature -PRON- may have be anything from a prosperous small tradesman to the head of a corporation 
-PRON- seem to have the faculty of look like absolutely no definite type and in a crowd -PRON- occur to girton one would have pass -PRON- fifty time without know -PRON- exist 
yet there be a queer assure ring to -PRON- voice as -PRON- say gentleman the pleasure of make -PRON- acquaintance be very great 
i bring -PRON- news 
news 
hemmett say 
news indeed smile mr jone 
-PRON- both of -PRON- be about to leave guanama the face of the thing the mysterious mr jone be mildly demente 
that be the one explanation capable of hold water 
fifteen second back -PRON- have not know -PRON- now in the most ridiculously confident fashion -PRON- be usher -PRON- out of the guanama -PRON- have do so much to make 
what be more have deliver -PRON- -PRON- bow and drop into a chair and laugh quite happily so that yes -PRON- be mad fast enough 
do i er understand -PRON- to say hemmett begin wonderingly 
that -PRON- be about to leave guanama 
-PRON- do mr hemmett jone laugh 
-PRON- will leave i think on the steamer that sail at one tomorrow 
just to please -PRON- mr jone 
girton ask amusedly 
to please -PRON- and because -PRON- will be to -PRON- considerable advantage say the caller -PRON- smile fade 
i have come with a business proposition gentleman which i believe -PRON- will find yourself unable to reject 
-PRON- seem to be quite an evening for business proposition hemmett mutter 
jone apparently do not understand nor do -PRON- waste time with question 
-PRON- smile polite inquiry at mr hemmett for an instant and then lean forward earnestly astonish a good many people in -PRON- time gentleman and i expect to astonish -PRON- say -PRON- 
however -PRON- be -PRON- own fault 
-PRON- two gentleman have pile up quite a reputation in the past as engineer and railroad builder and down here -PRON- have pile up another as executive of the high order 
that sort of executive as -PRON- very well know be beyond price these day back home 
in the united state 
i refer to -PRON- as -PRON- home of course jone pursue with an odd flit little smile 
-PRON- have follow big business development back there i take -PRON- 
but -PRON- have naturally 
and still say mr jone -PRON- havenot hear of the big one of recent year i refer to the railroad development 
head thrust forward the peculiar gentleman narrow -PRON- eye and study -PRON- intently for three second finally lean back with a contented little sigh 
i see that -PRON- have not -PRON- go on 
so much the well the black kind of secret -PRON- know but -PRON- two have the name down here of know everything in the world and i almost fear but that s nonsense of course 
mr girton mr hemmett 
the great railroad system in the united state be about to be build a new system go into new territory with new rail and new bridge and new rolling stock with new method of management and new method of operating 
-PRON- will be when finally work out the great single feat in the history of railroading 
that be absolutely every detail that i can give -PRON- at the moment 
not another explanatory word can be speak until -PRON- be establish in new york 
-PRON- snap -PRON- finger quite excitedly 
girton lean forward 
say what the devil be -PRON- talk about -PRON- ask 
i have do talk about the thing -PRON- jone smile 
i have come to the point 
-PRON- want two man at the head of the construction and -PRON- have comb the world for -PRON- 
i believe that i have find -PRON- 
gentleman i offer -PRON- each a post with a tenyear contract at a salary of one hundred thousand dollar annually 
hey 
hemmett shout 
the first year salary to be pay tomorrow morning and yourself to sail for new york on steamer 
but -PRON- canot but -PRON- canot afford to do anything else 
jone say suavely 
-PRON- duty for three month at least will be essentially nothing 
-PRON- will find office in the city and those in charge will assign -PRON- to -PRON- own quarter and give -PRON- every particular that i be forbid to give 
gentleman -PRON- accept 
mr hemmett clear -PRON- throat with some effort 
if -PRON- be the brand of gentleman who can be carry off -PRON- foot -PRON- would accept -PRON- say not 
-PRON- have considerable property here and i be quite certain that -PRON- can be dispose of to advantage 
i would almost guarantee to take care of that 
and -PRON- home be here hemmett go on irritably 
-PRON- belong in guanama man and who the dicken be -PRON- anyway 
well -PRON- name be jone and a plain citizen employ by big interest the gentleman say simply 
-PRON- father be an englishman and -PRON- mother german get a french grandmother and i be bear in kansas city spend part of -PRON- boyhood in london and gather part of -PRON- education and business experience in berlin and paris 
be that answer enough a little confusing but -PRON- will do girton answer dryly 
now tell -PRON- the reason for the secrecy jone about the railroad 
that i be simply forbid to do 
can -PRON- start tomorrow 
the late secretary of war try to catch the eye of -PRON- old friend jone be between -PRON- 
-PRON- be a mighty offer a staggering offer 
yet with -PRON- glittering gold -PRON- twang so strongly on the string ricoro have set vibrate that suspicion well up in girton 
no -PRON- canot leave tomorrow 
hemmett say sharply 
and -PRON- canot accept a thing about which -PRON- know absolutely nothing or can -PRON- accept -PRON- at a salary of one hundred and twentyfive thousand 
what 
why er no 
hemmett stammer 
can -PRON- accept -PRON- at a salary of one hundred and fifty thousand dollar ask mr jone 
the money to be pay in advance tomorrow morning 
think 
-PRON- be the very thing -PRON- be try to do and a difficult thing when one look at jone utterly calm utterly commonplace talk like a lunatic and still look as if -PRON- mean just what -PRON- say 
covertly edward hemmett grip the arm of -PRON- chair when -PRON- speak -PRON- be something like a man speak in a dream 
a a matter of this kind canot be close in one minute -PRON- state with conviction so overwhelming that -PRON- sound er a trifle crazy jone consider -PRON- for a few day and then just what -PRON- will not do mr hemmett jone assure -PRON- swiftly 
this thing demand an immediate answer because -PRON- be start tomorrow i tell -PRON- 
why what ail -PRON- man -PRON- understand the figure offer -PRON- see that for ten year -PRON- re acquire the equivalent of another three million apiece at five per cent 
i hadnot an idea that -PRON- would even hesitate gentleman far less well -PRON- have an idea now that hesitating 
hemmett say dizzily man canot readjust -PRON- whole lifq in fifteen second just because some one come around and try to hand -PRON- the national treasury 
hemmett cut in mr jone i offer -PRON- two hundred thousand dollar apiece the limit empower to go and that settle -PRON- 
will -PRON- be ready to sail 
hemmett shut -PRON- tooth 
stephen girton do one of the most remarkable thing of -PRON- lifetime for -PRON- step forward and tap mr arm and look at mr jone much as if that gentleman have seek to pick -PRON- pocket 
if -PRON- want an answer yes or no on the spot the answer be no -PRON- say sternly 
-PRON- will not accept and -PRON- will not sail 
-PRON- may be a maniac or -PRON- may be try to hand -PRON- something that be simply beyond human understanding at present but that doesnot affect the answer 
the answer be no 
and now if mr jone have astound -PRON- -PRON- seem that mr jone -PRON- be astound 
-PRON- jaw drop and -PRON- eye open incredulously -PRON- squint at stephen girton and -PRON- voice drop 
if there s any little deficiency in the mental stuff -PRON- your -PRON- say unexpectedly 
once in a while a man be offer something so good that -PRON- s bind to take -PRON- blindfold and thank -PRON- star -PRON- come -PRON- way what offer -PRON- and bosh not refuse 
oh be refuse fast enough 
hemmett contribute 
not definitely perhaps but until -PRON- have have time to consider impossible 
-PRON- accept tonight and sail tomorrow or -PRON- off 
then -PRON- off retort mr girton and would haye like to clasp -PRON- brow 
over william jone come the strange of change 
where -PRON- have smile -PRON- sneer where -PRON- have be amiable and commonplace hard line appear suddenly and give -PRON- an indefinable evil threatening aspect where there have be little or no character there be a quantity of very unpleasant character 
in two second the man have become a personality and a very disturbing one 
i refuse to believe that that s final say -PRON- 
-PRON- be final say mr girton turn down four hundred thousand dollar a year between -PRON- rather than make up -PRON- mind to pull up stake in this spot 
-PRON- seem to be do just that the most unwise thing -PRON- ever do mr girton 
be -PRON- 
-PRON- be the new jone say curtly 
will -PRON- be good enough to remember that i tell -PRON- that 
will -PRON- phone -PRON- if -PRON- change -PRON- mind before morning 
-PRON- will 
very well gentleman 
good night 
and think -PRON- over gentleman 
think -PRON- over at the edge of the terrace watch the white motor coast downhill 
then -PRON- turn back to -PRON- old friend with a confused smile 
just about five minute more of mr jone and -PRON- would have take -PRON- to the new puerto carlo asylum say -PRON- 
be -PRON- real 
hemmett face -PRON- steadily 
maybe -PRON- be the real thing that have happen to -PRON- in guanama -PRON- reply that something big behind -PRON- just as there be something big behind that offer of steve 
no one man no one concern be strew money around in million like that not exaggerate -PRON- own importance but be a certain power in this country and be think harder in the last two minute than think in four year 
the object of this evening little lunatic game be to get -PRON- out of guanama 
do -PRON- believe -PRON- 
mr girton ask sit down quite suddenly 
i believe more than that 
why should those two proposition have be hurl at -PRON- that way if -PRON- want anything else 
any two ordinary man would have fall for both of -PRON- steve 
if -PRON- close with ricoro and close with jone and the money be real -PRON- would have nothing to do but retire to new york buy up central park and build a home in the middle and there s something big behind -PRON- 
-PRON- say that before 
and keep on say -PRON- until i find the answer hemmett assure -PRON- and here another point that have be come up in -PRON- mind 
the factory the national engine work all the money that have come into guanama in the last two year 
do -PRON- realize that almost every penny of -PRON- have come from one european nation 
-PRON- eye snap 
beneath the tropical tan long since acquire blood be surge up nor do girton remain unaffected 
the recent dizziness return to mr girton and -PRON- stammer -PRON- -PRON- have get the darned imagination possibly 
but the thing that appeal to -PRON- be that in all common sense a nation and only a nation can spend money like that and the nation that have be spend million on million in guanama want -PRON- to get out 
yes 
and here since the matter have ascend or descend to the purely ridiculous girton throw back -PRON- head and laugh suddenly 
-PRON- catch frown and laugh the hard 
-PRON- even slap -PRON- knee and rock for a little and -PRON- end with a wheeze 
well -PRON- a funny notion anyway -PRON- remark 
-PRON- think there s nothing in -PRON- ask the unsmile hemmett 
i have a glorious opinion of -PRON- and another of -PRON- but i refuse to believe that a great european nation want -PRON- to move to new york ne yes 
mr hemmett rise with a dry smile 
just the same well step across the street and have a guarded little talk with fatherinlaw say -PRON- 
about all of this 
not necessarily 
fernandez be a guanaman with all the national characteristic no idea of tell just what have happen and have -PRON- form -PRON- own theory and chatter about -PRON- to every other capitalist -PRON- meet for the next month but -PRON- do happen once in a while that by careful sounding papa fernandez can be make to drop a helpful little hint or two steve have more than one clue to a peculiar situation from -PRON- lip and come along 
silently -PRON- lead the way across to the magnificent fernandez home and merriment die out within -PRON- 
for one thing -PRON- could find no tenable answer to the double riddle for another ned hemmett have a disconcerting way of be absolutely right just when one fancy that imagination have carry -PRON- away and at the doorway hemmett be turn to -PRON- friend and say gravely let -PRON- do the talk steve 
if -PRON- know what s afoot hell drop a clue 
-PRON- find fernandez in -PRON- library a room magnificent as all the other but rather cluttered just now with hunting paraphernalia 
this be the season when of late year fernandez have be take to the mountain for a week in quest of some of the reasonably big game to be find there 
a highpowered riflebarrel lie across -PRON- desk and -PRON- smile at -PRON- over -PRON- 
ah edward 
the boy in bed -PRON- say 
not yet i believe 
-PRON- hadnot come to kiss -PRON- good night when i leave hemmett say rather lazily the thirty gun isnot -PRON- 
that be the thirty edward the one pedro almost ruin last year 
look through -PRON- now 
-PRON- offer the riflebarrel and hemmett hold -PRON- to the light and squint through 
rebore eh 
nice clean job too -PRON- say 
i didnot know -PRON- would send -PRON- 
this afternoon smile fernandez when -PRON- come back eh 
-PRON- take a good while a job like that 
-PRON- canot be do outside the good old state of connecticut 
i send -PRON- this afternoon and -PRON- come back this afternoon fernandez correct amazingly 
that wasnot rebore in guanama 
but of a certainty edward 
be that so astonishing 
-PRON- have a gunsmith in town now pedro tell -PRON- 
a nice job a very nice job 
-PRON- pat the barrel which be well for -PRON- could not see the color flow from cheek during that minute which follow 
girton be do some staring of -PRON- own too and now with a jerk hemmett be -PRON- again and however brief the call -PRON- be move toward the door 
well i just drop in to see if carman have leave that second volume of jean christophe over here -PRON- say in a slightly strained voice and i remember now that -PRON- on -PRON- desk not start tomorrow 
the day after edward 
will -PRON- not sit and smoke 
not now thank er something in that book i want to show steve 
good night 
not to the entrance of the house but straight down the corridor to the rear -PRON- lead steve girton and there -PRON- clutch -PRON- arm and all but hiss do -PRON- get -PRON- 
-PRON- think the job be do in a regulation gun factory 
-PRON- couldnot have be do anywhere else in the world steve get a secret gun factory in puerto carlo and a dandy 
and yet ostensibly -PRON- can hardly have a hammer repair in this town and this be no crazy secret factory of the guanaman government either because -PRON- donot need one 
-PRON- have nineteen thousand more rifle than -PRON- have man and here -PRON- 
be pedro in the house 
the darkskinne native maid bob -PRON- head and hurry off 
mr hemmett with another of this evening effort straighten up and shed some of -PRON- outward excitement -PRON- have all but accomplish -PRON- lazy smile when the dapper little native servant appear 
that gun of senor fernandez pedro 
hemmett say 
where do -PRON- have -PRON- fix get one tfcat i want rebore 
the gun senor 
but yes come in liquid spanish 
i take -PRON- to -PRON- cousin agustin zaro senor who labor in the national engine work 
-PRON- -PRON- be who do the work 
in the national engine work 
hemmett demand 
yes senor but as to the other the gun of -PRON- senor i do not know 
there be trouble of a sort about this one i think 
i give no heed to the mouthing of agustin for -PRON- have ever be a silly fellow senor but there be trouble about -PRON- have do the work 
still i will inquire senor 
for a dollar or two perhaps -PRON- can be accomplish 
well donot donot bother if -PRON- be likely to make trouble for -PRON- cousin hemmett answer in a husky voice that try hard to be careless all pedro 
the man glide away 
breathe hard hemmett lead the way back to the terrace of -PRON- own beautiful home and now -PRON- be no amused girton that -PRON- face 
be -PRON- all imagination steve 
hemmett ask 
be there something afoot in this town and this country that have go clear over -PRON- head 
do the presence of an arm factory practically own by that european nation mean anything 
anything or nothing perhaps but and -PRON- new navy steve 
hemmett go on almost wildly as fact after fact rise up before -PRON- in the illumination of this startling evening 
the new battle cruiser almiranta out there in the harbor why do -PRON- object to people go aboard -PRON- 
why be that boat and other of the new boat supposedly buy as secondhand junk so infernally modern as to line 
why why be all of -PRON- 
girton laugh shortly 
i donot know but i do know this -PRON- time to have a look at the national engine work at close range 
can -PRON- manage -PRON- 
can any one stop -PRON- if -PRON- sneak down there at night tonight even the late secretary of war ask 
-PRON- know not exaggerate the thing yet 
but if any european nation be establish a base of armament here with the united state just a little way north ne -PRON- be too absurd perhaps 
-PRON- could not say -PRON- old monroe in a fair way to be blow into a million piece finish hemmett for -PRON- thickly in the darkness utterly peaceful surround by every manifestation of civilization and wealth and placid prosperity girton and hemmett stand aghast 
second pass before girton be capable of not impossible 
guanama owe too much to the united state to sell -PRON- out like that 
such a thing couldnot be carry on secretly and -PRON- have be so far and here another point look at the way prominent american have be get out lately 
carter have an offer from new york a native combine buy out business and -PRON- go back to chicago with the whole force britt trade -PRON- interest for other in panama and make fifty thousand dollar and go and morton and fowler 
and be here 
yes be here and begin to think that be not guanaman voice thicken suddenly and shake a little beginning to think that be american after all steve because the very thought of what this forlorn little hole of a country be try to put over on the united state make -PRON- so damn furious -PRON- catch -PRON- but there be another breathing hard just beside -PRON- 
stephen girton would have speak several second sooner but for the peculiar clogging of -PRON- throat 
when -PRON- do speak -PRON- be very quietly go and see the national engine work now -PRON- say grimly 
one disadvantage of popularity be that one doesnot wander about without attract attention 
to step from home to the motor would have be simple and conspicuous 
-PRON- confer very briefly on this point and make -PRON- decision and each of -PRON- thrill a little for steal out in the old khaki take back street and back road to the national engine work savor strongly of the good old day before prosperity come when the blood move fast and one wit now and then be all that stand between one and the hereafter 
carman hemmett fortunately enough for -PRON- do not approve of adventure that involve -PRON- husband be occupy with caller of -PRON- own 
the chatter of girl the tinkle of the piano come from the drawingroom when hemmett shabby in the clothe of -PRON- engineering day and with -PRON- automatic pistol in -PRON- pocket for the first time in month steal down the back stair to wait for steve girton 
-PRON- have kiss -PRON- beloved boy good night and yes be -PRON- admit that mr hemmett feel a bit odd 
-PRON- be come back in an hour or two of course 
and really nothing would happen 
and now that the first shock have pass -PRON- half expect to find that -PRON- have be make a mountainrange out of an undersized molehill 
-PRON- would discover that the national engine work be harmless and -PRON- turn to girton 
ready -PRON- ask go out the back way around and down the alley behind the garage once be down the hill -PRON- will be easy enough to keep in the dark spot 
right say girton whose jaw be set understand that be go into that engine work before -PRON- quit 
i think -PRON- be 
march say the retired secretary of war 
side by side close the door very softly -PRON- step into the gloom 
side by side -PRON- hurry past home with -PRON- soft light and -PRON- marble reach and then downhill into the less opulent quarter of puerto carlo 
and -PRON- be gratify to note that in -PRON- old tog -PRON- draw little attention from the casual night prowler -PRON- be to all intent adventurous derelict of the type which drift into guanama often enough and drift out again 
now -PRON- have pass the town altogether and be on the barren stretch destine some day to be an attractive suburb that lie between the outskirt of puerto carlo and the bulk of the national engine work loom big and black at the end of the wretched dirt road 
four keen eye peer through the pitchy blackness as -PRON- trudge along and could see nothing 
puerto carlo waste no electricity in this section but there be weird tale of sentry who shoo the general public from the vast factory shoot before -PRON- hail 
the tale be the product of the native mind of course but halt say a voice directly in -PRON- path 
-PRON- owner have come from nowhere but -PRON- be there and with a flashlight and a rifle 
more -PRON- seem puzzle as the light flare into -PRON- face 
-PRON- voice grow respectful 
-PRON- be not permit to pass this point senore 
-PRON- -PRON- be not permit to pass this point senor 
i have strict order 
unfortunate be -PRON- for the unknown that edward hemmett have be meditate hotly these last minute upon the trick guanama seem about to play on -PRON- own united state 
there be a swish and the flashlight go into the air to shine upon the grass a dozen yard away 
there be a thud and a stifle yell and then not a sound until do -PRON- knock -PRON- out 
girton ask interestedly 
i think so 
i have -PRON- here and -PRON- s limp hemmett announce from the ground tie -PRON- hand with the handkerchief from -PRON- neck 
jam -PRON- down -PRON- beastly throat and make -PRON- fast steve the talk 
have -PRON- a belt 
make of rope eh 
so much the well 
this will do for -PRON- leg 
-PRON- be well for -PRON- reputation that no arc lamp shine upon -PRON- feat 
three minute more and an unconscious man be lie with -PRON- closed eye to the star gag and bind and the march to the national engine work be on again silently as before and a little more grim because the story of exaggerated precaution have be true and the significance be sinister 
-PRON- eye peer the more keenly and -PRON- step grow light and cautious as -PRON- come to within a bare fifty yard of the tower wooden fence that enclose the work 
behind that fence wideawake man be move about for the sound of voice come distinctly through the night 
machinery of some sort be run too at a considerable distance 
and over there be a little gateway in the boarding for -PRON- could see a faint rectangular outline of light and past -PRON- back and forth a sentry pace 
not that gate for -PRON- breathed hemmett sneak along this way and look for another 
i wonder if -PRON- dare go any close have to girton whisper 
-PRON- look over there another entrance ne 
there be at least another outline rectangle and before this one no figure move 
reach -PRON- mean steal along for three hundred foot and then advance directly upon the gate and if the sentry in this case chance to be beside the gate and alert the expedition have reach -PRON- end 
still now that -PRON- be within sixty or seventy foot no hail have come 
-PRON- crouch and move onward and through the night come a gentle snore 
twenty second and -PRON- be beside the sleeper and -PRON- snore on 
this sentry at least be typically guanaman for -PRON- slumber at the post of duty hand be already upon the knob of the little wooden door 
the thing open freely and before -PRON- lay black shadow with the white light of arclamp on the mighty open space beyond 
-PRON- have enter the national engine work 
beside -PRON- loom a wooden building faintly illuminate with window well above -PRON- head 
-PRON- gaze up at the near and with a quick nod hemmett bend forward and brace hand on knee while girton more after the fashion of an acrobat than a retired secretary of war clamber to -PRON- broad back and stand erect 
-PRON- be down again within half a minute snarl under -PRON- breath settle the status of the national engine work first crack -PRON- whisper the shop where -PRON- finish the stock for army rifle 
there must be two thousand of -PRON- in sight stand in rack while the varnish dry 
two thousand 
look for -PRON- if -PRON- like ne take -PRON- word for -PRON- hemmett mutter get up to the edge of this wall and see what s to be see 
-PRON- steal along the wooden side of the building pause only when another foot would have find -PRON- in the white light 
hat in hand -PRON- peer cautiously around down the vast yard that seem to be the center of the establishment 
man be move about guanaman for the most part but visibly direct by at least three citizen whose blood hold no latin strain whatever three citizen who despite -PRON- white skin be total stranger to a man who fancy that -PRON- know by sight all the foreign population of puerto carlo 
mr hemmett draw a deep breath 
i fancy that be get the whole story in allopathic dose steve -PRON- report 
that appear to be the main shop over there and there s a little door partly open 
can -PRON- duck across without be see 
start when the chance seem good girton say simply 
a minute drag along while hemmett watch the move figure intently sortie near at hand some far down the big yard 
two minute go and then three and quite suddenly the of rich man dart into the light with girton at -PRON- heel dart straight for the shadow of the tremendous building across the yard and vanish again in the shadow 
-PRON- get away with -PRON- 
hemmett breathe as -PRON- tiptoe toward the door 
-PRON- skin through by one hair breadth because by the piper that play before mose -PRON- end in an utterly thunderstruck gasp 
girton be at -PRON- side girton with the effort of -PRON- life stifle a savage yell because there be cause enough for several yell 
spread before -PRON- in the blaze of a hundred arclamp stretch hundred of foot away the big shop lie reveal 
crane be there of gigantic proportion and from the near hang a length of steel yard and yard in length with the black circle of -PRON- muzzle toward -PRON- a sixinch rifle 
near the opposite wall an endless line of black circle meet -PRON- eye finish unmounted fieldgun of the seventyfive millimeter type 
yet the two giant lathe in the center of the shop claim all -PRON- attention after that first dumfouqding minute one of -PRON- be empty the other beyond human question hold a thing plainly impossible in guanama a fourteeninch gun of the most modern type in process of manufacture 
-PRON- lord 
-PRON- lord mutter girton 
and every darned bit of -PRON- must have be land in section and at night and -PRON- must have take month to careful this whisper -PRON- old friend 
be that some one come around the corner of the building or yes 
here 
duck this way 
even now the shadow of the newcomer fall plainly out there in the yard and -PRON- be move swiftly as if to investigate -PRON- own particular nook 
as one -PRON- crouch low and race toward the far side of the alleged engine work property the side that give upon the shore of puerto carlo harbor 
as one -PRON- slide to a standstill beside another of the little gate in the outer fence and while sentry may be without that figure behind carry a rifle and be still move in -PRON- direction 
-PRON- seem uncertain still as to -PRON- presence 
-PRON- pause and look about and with -PRON- back turn to -PRON- for an instant edward hemmett push open the gate and step forth into the blacker night with girton at -PRON- heel 
the gate -PRON- close behind -PRON- without a creak 
the step within do not follow to the gate 
-PRON- be safely out and halt senor or i shoot announce another of the night black figure thrust the muzzle of -PRON- rifle into mr rib silent excite little laugh which have be upon lip as the gate close behind -PRON- turn to a small wheeze 
involuntarily almost -PRON- say touch -PRON- steve get -PRON- cover i i have no idea of touch -PRON- 
girton report breathlessly from a point some five yard distant 
-PRON- colleague have a rifle jam into the pit of -PRON- stomach 
the sentry be talk too both at once each apparently rebuke the other for not obey order and shoot down any person who come through the gate in either direction 
brief though the chatter -PRON- give hemmett and girton time for some very painful thought 
that -PRON- be do for seem beyond question no establishment as large as the national engine work can keep -PRON- nature secret without very energetic measure and doubtless ether investigative mind which have pass this way have cease to be 
-PRON- be outrageous of course and incredible but so be the whole plant for that matter 
yes and now the sentry have conclude that order be order and the barrel against rib shake a little and the click of a cocked hammer come to -PRON- ear 
edward hemmett in perhaps the tenth part of one second gather -PRON- for the lightning drop the lightning tackle of the invisible knee and through the gloom come the trouble 
-PRON- be a sharp voice yet strangely familiar 
follow -PRON- another of the pocket flashlight blaze out and amazement come into the voice and a note of sharp anxiety senor hemmett 
and senor girton too 
-PRON- fellow 
drop that rifle 
the senor a torrent of spanish assail -PRON- come from both sentry voice shake with relief as -PRON- demand be that luis engoro 
-PRON- be luis engoro lieutenant of the guanaman navy senor the anxious voice report 
but -PRON- senore 
what be -PRON- do here where none may come 
why never mind what be do here get -PRON- out of -PRON- 
girton put in as step approach from the other side of the wall 
this be no time for argument kid 
remember that hemmett and i feed -PRON- whole family for six month three year ago luis 
remember that hemmett and i come across with the cash for the operation that save -PRON- life and but how can i forget senor young engoro cry agonizedly 
-PRON- be that which wring -PRON- heart because enough 
come 
come quickly 
-PRON- be a person of some authority in this accursed neighborhood 
the sentry have permit -PRON- to be swallow up in the gloom and luis engoro be reach out toward hemmett and girton with both hand 
-PRON- catch the hand and clung to -PRON- and engoro start straight down the steep bank toward the water 
although -PRON- be not so very steep be -PRON- 
and a very broad flight of step have grow up since -PRON- last visit to this particular spot 
above by the gateway flashlight be twinkle at interval and voice rise in heated spanish but -PRON- do not pause to listen 
engoro know -PRON- way and even now -PRON- be lead -PRON- along a narrow little dock 
and now -PRON- stop 
down here senore -PRON- whisper 
-PRON- be the tender of the almiranta see 
i shall put -PRON- ashore in the city 
if the tender have own an engineer -PRON- be elsewhere 
engoro -PRON- set the quiet motor to hum as -PRON- cast off 
engoro at the wheel turn the little craft out into the harbor and -PRON- be safe 
-PRON- have be a rather narrow squeak and not tljat either girton s brow nor be without a warm shiny film induce mainly by excitement 
but -PRON- be safely away from one of the world big arm factory and nobody have elect to shoot after -PRON- and with every turn of the screw lurid thought pound through two brain that have grow altogether too much accustomed to the peacefully conventional 
week after week month after month -PRON- have fairly be sit atop a plot of such magnitude as guanama have never know before 
where -PRON- have start where -PRON- may end whither may extend -PRON- present ramification no man could say but that -PRON- have corrupt at least one of more intelligent youth be prove by engoro s presence at that wheel and -PRON- utter silence 
luis 
girton say suddenly 
come out with the truth 
do -PRON- understand 
i understand senor but -PRON- be impossible say engoro thinly 
i beg of -PRON- senor that the the matter be leave undiscussed 
i have save -PRON- 
and be grateful lui and that doesnot alter the fact that this be one of the thing that canot be leave undiscussed 
hemmett say firmly 
-PRON- come out with the truth boy 
i can not 
why not 
because even for what i have do i may pay with -PRON- life answer the young man 
should i speak freely who can say what will befall -PRON- 
-PRON- be an astonishing statement consider that -PRON- have do no more than save the life of two lawabide citizen that -PRON- be a lieutenant in navy and that -PRON- be at this minute in a government tender but -PRON- mean -PRON- 
-PRON- even shudder and glance back at -PRON- with a face that be pale in the light of the tender lamp 
steve girton rise abruptly and come to -PRON- elbow 
engoro say -PRON- always like -PRON- -PRON- know that try to help -PRON- too and like to help -PRON- out of this 
but be go to have the truth from -PRON- lui and while wete on the job -PRON- can tell -PRON- to -PRON- aboard the almiranta 
i think that vessel will bear look over about now 
but sefior 
engoro gasp 
that too be impossible 
why be -PRON- impossible 
i will not lie and i can not explain the young man say doggedly 
then help -PRON- out of the predicament by leave -PRON- no choice kid say the retired secretary of war and the muzzle of -PRON- automatic be train suddenly on luis 
-PRON- make straight for the almiranta take -PRON- aboard and show -PRON- around the ship and if -PRON- feel inclined to do anything else keep on head for the shore and well blow -PRON- thick young head from -PRON- shoulder kick the carcass of a traitor overboard and go aboard the almiranta -PRON- 
what about -PRON- 
the face of luis engoro turn toward -PRON- be no less than stricken 
the wheel wabble in -PRON- hand and then because luis be all guanaman after all -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder philosophically and accept the inevitable quite as girton have expect 
the tender veer about and make straight for the bulk of the almiranta out near the mouth of the harbor 
-PRON- be not all the visible part of navy but -PRON- be the most interesting tonight 
whatever -PRON- may be -PRON- be certain that three more like -PRON- be anchor down the coast ostensibly by way of leave more room in the harbor actually as the american suspect more and more strongly to keep -PRON- away from interested eye 
there be something too modern about the cut of the 
almiranta to jibe with -PRON- alleged status as the castoff of a foreign navy and with the low price at which guanama have buy -PRON- 
past the three destroyer -PRON- speed in utter silence past the two battleship that have form the nucleus of the new guanaman navy and on to the almiranta 
at -PRON- landingstage -PRON- come to a halt a pair of able seaman come down and girton and hemmett with luis engoro between -PRON- hurry to the deck 
the lieutenant have not a solitary word to say 
nor be much information from -PRON- necessary once -PRON- be able to inspect the cruiser at close range 
-PRON- be new 
from -PRON- deckplate to -PRON- fightingmast -PRON- be utterly new 
-PRON- engine when -PRON- come upon -PRON- be of the late and the fast and the most powerful type 
the strange trio with luis lag hurried on to -PRON- gunrcom 
-PRON- have be announce and accept as a matter of course that the almiranta have be purchase practically without armament 
that would come another year with new appropriation 
but when girton and hemmett have penetrate to the fighting section of the cruiser -PRON- grow breathless for a little 
-PRON- be not unarmed -PRON- be indeed overload with armament 
mighty battery some mount some ready to mount be behind those closed and rusty port small quickfirer shine through the thick protective grease be there without end and below very deftly arrange so that -PRON- could be put into action with a scant day notice three torpedotube modem to the minute be reveal 
the magazine be not fill -PRON- be cram 
shell of the new type be there tier on tier ready for the ingenious hoist -PRON- so modern that neither girton nor hemmett have ever see -PRON- like before 
-PRON- have see too much this last quarterhour to feel great surprise at the sight rather -PRON- stand stunned for a little as the meaning of -PRON- all loom before -PRON- 
steve girton very quietly lay a hand on arm 
look here kid say -PRON- -PRON- may as well talk a little now see what -PRON- come to see in -PRON- thick arenot -PRON- 
yes senor 
be there many more supposedly decent intelligent boy like -PRON- in this navy 
the pay be high senor luis mutter 
the other cruiser down the coast be -PRON- like this 
yes senor engoro whisper 
all three 
all eleven and the three battleship luis correct 
what 
-PRON- be the truth senor and now i beg of -PRON- let -PRON- say no more the lieutenant plead 
i owe -PRON- much seriore 
i have pay this evening 
but before other come to ask about why i take -PRON- from the shore will -PRON- not leave senor 
to -PRON- -PRON- mean life or death and there be no more to see 
upon that i give -PRON- -PRON- word ask -PRON- one more question and well skip 
girton run -PRON- finger through -PRON- hair and blink confusedly and for the second time that night wonder if reality actually could be reality too bright to be in this thing blindly luis 
-PRON- know and -PRON- know that for the first time in history a european power have establish a naval base on the american side of the world and a big one 
how in name -PRON- have be keep under cover for so long pass -PRON- understanding -PRON- must have buy guanama body and soup but what i want to ask -PRON- be this be there more ship of this kind come -PRON- have be say senor engoro mutter 
and if enough of -PRON- get here to handle the job -PRON- be intend to attack the united state 
girton pursue 
-PRON- -PRON- have be say senor that that coercion that oh go senor 
engoro flounder wildly 
for -PRON- have be swear that death shall be the portion of one of -PRON- who -PRON- could get no further 
girton tooth grind gaze speculatively down at -PRON- automatic pistol 
hemmett white again and with hand twitch come close to engoro 
-PRON- nasty little brown rat -PRON- say rather be dead than be in -PRON- shoe 
-PRON- canot understand that can -PRON- 
-PRON- canot understand what the united state have do for this country for -PRON- first and last can -PRON- 
-PRON- donot know what gratitude be -PRON- donot know what decency even mean but -PRON- do know how to sneak up on a sleep man or a sleep nation and drive in a knife if -PRON- be pay eh like to kick the life out of -PRON- filthy pelt but have to kick the life out of half of guanama afterward to be consistent i suppose go engoro and in a very little time the united state will send force down here to spoil the whole game and when that happen -PRON- will get your 
and if i can have the job of punish -PRON- assign to -PRON- truss -PRON- up to one of -PRON- pretty basketwork mast and leave -PRON- there till the bird pick -PRON- bone 
thank -PRON- for save -PRON- life engoro and be damn to -PRON- 
come steve 
a sailorman set into motion by engoro whose leg bade fair to collapse beneath -PRON- run -PRON- back to shore tremble incessantly as -PRON- peer about the desert pier of the yacht club and then whirl about row off through the night as if the power of evil be after the boat 
-PRON- be early morning now as the two american tramp silently uphill to the hemmett home silently because puerto carlo be largely ear even in the small hour and because each man be think more astonishing thought than the normal brain could conveniently handle 
only as -PRON- come to the terrace of the still dark house do girton say softly just what be go to be the speedy way of get busy ned sleep on -PRON- till morning hemmett answer 
then well get barton the more or less gifted american minister up here lie the truth before -PRON- and have a report in washington before noon 
after that -PRON- up to the united state and while that have lately be a darned sight more complacent nation than -PRON- use to be in -PRON- time i still have a suspicion that there will be something do 
the nation all right -PRON- need wake up that s all 
girton say 
and i think this will do -PRON- and whether -PRON- do -PRON- or not rather be an american hodcarrier than the president of this dirty traitorous little hole 
when i think that -PRON- be engage to a guanaman girl and marry to another 
hemmett laugh queerly 
i hadnot think of that the retired secretary say rather blankly 
well i have and -PRON- be no more to blame for the doing of the politician here than the folk back home and -PRON- wonot discuss the thing over the breakfasttable by the way 
daylight come before sleep reach either man 
-PRON- personal world have turn upside down since eight oclock or thereabout last evening 
mentally and to some extent physically -PRON- have be settle down these last year to guanama and all that guanama imply 
-PRON- have be content and prosperous and too busy with routine work to give great heed to possible plotting indeed while neither of -PRON- have harbor the concrete thought perhaps -PRON- have believe that plot and guanama once so intimately associate be divorce for all time 
ferrata be president and due for reelection like the bulk of the lawmaker guanama be a hive of industry and all be well 
and now ferrata and -PRON- party have be oust and sinister influence long at work beneath the surface be come into full view with some of the manifestation focus upon -PRON- 
there could be no question that the hide power be more than merely anxious to see the last of -PRON- 
ricoro tool or conspirator have prove -PRON- conclusively could -PRON- have but read the true significance of -PRON- offer at the time of -PRON- making 
jone the incredible have prove -PRON- and both have prove that the giant fester be come to a head 
morning as a rule find both man very clearbrained but not this morning 
the whole thing be too overwhelming too grotesque for assimilation even now 
girton before breakfast go with -PRON- highpowere binocular to the terrace and look over the national engine work and the almiranta as if to assure -PRON- that -PRON- really exist 
rust be the thing mainly visible on such of the cruiser as may be see from puerto carlo 
pile of packingcase tier of harmless lumber be all the glass show of the work beside roof and wall 
carman -PRON- appear wished to ride with the boy to an aunt in the uphill suburb for the morning and -PRON- husband assent with a readiness that cause -PRON- to stare for a moment 
-PRON- go nevertheless and before the motor be out of sight hemmett have john barton the american minister on the telephone and be fairly order -PRON- to report at the hemmett home 
-PRON- be up to barton alone of course and -PRON- wish sincerely that -PRON- may have be a gentleman of different stamp 
-PRON- look -PRON- over as -PRON- come in a plump commonplace man not very intelligent not very well educate a political growth who have be a power in -PRON- own section and for whom some provision have to be make 
the post at guanama be not quite in the class of the court of st jame and -PRON- incumbent be sometimes correspondingly below what may be desire 
still barton be the whole visible supply of united state authority and when -PRON- have lock the library door and arrange thing so that no interested listener could well come within range without attract attention -PRON- tell -PRON- tale 
john barton listen puff out an exclamation here and there remove -PRON- glass and polish -PRON- at regular interval scowl incredulously at hemmett and then at stephen girton until finally -PRON- come to the end and with a dubious glance at each other impatiently await -PRON- view upon the astounding situation 
-PRON- come when -PRON- have stare perplexedly across the room for a long minute 
i think gentleman that -PRON- exaggerate -PRON- say heavily 
do that do that mean that -PRON- donot believe what -PRON- have tell -PRON- 
girton demand 
i should hesitate to put -PRON- in just that way the american minister smile tartly 
i think gentleman pardon -PRON- sure that -PRON- have see some of these thing and fancy the rest 
the united state as -PRON- be perfectly well aware be on good term with the entire world 
so good as to make -PRON- impossible that any european nation should have decide to take a chance on come over pick a fight and recapture some of the unbelievable gold supply that have flow into america of late year 
hemmett cry 
barton laugh aloud and wearily 
oh but -PRON- dear sir -PRON- protest that bugaboo be lay to rest 
i think sir that the yellow journal -PRON- have weary of harp on that absurd idea 
but and for another thing mr hemmett the minister pursue testily operation of such magnitude as -PRON- suggest be perfectly impossible secretly at any rate 
to -PRON- the idea that a gigantic naval base be form in guanama be simply grotesque 
well in spite of what do or do not strike -PRON- as grotesque -PRON- can go straight to the president of this republic and demand permission to inspect the national engine work canot -PRON- 
girton ask hotly 
i can assuredly 
and i shall not render -PRON- office ridiculous by do anything of the kind mr girton 
i shaller report to washington all that -PRON- have tell -PRON- not give the statement as prove fact but as hearsay sir 
and -PRON- will not even verify i will do what i have say sir and if -PRON- government wish -PRON- to move further in the matter instruction to that effect will be forward to -PRON- as -PRON- know 
pah mr girton glower like that 
i know -PRON- will know when both of -PRON- be a little calmer that the whole thing be a false alarm 
grant that there be a gun factory out there gentleman 
what more natural than that the guanaman government -PRON- for reason doubtless good and sufficient have decide to manufacture -PRON- own war munition 
and -PRON- nightmare cruiser and the fleet that be supose to be somewhere down the coast 
the reason for -PRON- stand on the very face of -PRON- recital 
these guanaman raise the very dicken at the idea of -PRON- precious taxis be spend for anything but plaza and public bullring and band concert as -PRON- very well know 
unquestionably the government be form an efficient navy and very wisely keep from the public the amount spend 
then -PRON- think a fake too 
i think sir from -PRON- account that -PRON- be drunk 
barton snap 
and please do not force -PRON- to say gentleman that i almost suspect er ahem 
-PRON- wonot because if -PRON- happen to say -PRON- -PRON- may be necessary to take a good grip on the scruff of -PRON- neck hemmett inform -PRON- 
and let -PRON- say this barton believe what -PRON- like or believe nothing at all i be go to take -PRON- upon -PRON- to report to washington direct that here -PRON- stop because the knocking on the door have become insistent 
girton answer -PRON- and come face to face with the little butler and behind the little butler stand dr cortera -PRON- perhaps the big medical man in guanama and -PRON- very good and very old friend 
pardon -PRON- for pop in like this 
dr cortera say quickly in -PRON- easy english important the thing that bring -PRON- here 
-PRON- concern the united state and oh i didnot see -PRON- mr barton 
girton be lock the door again 
hemmett rise to -PRON- foot 
what concern the united state 
well a a deathbed confession old man cortera answer after a little hesitation 
i have rather intend tell -PRON- about -PRON- first and then go down with -PRON- to mr office if -PRON- see fit 
go on 
cortera glance keenly from one to the other then smile grimly at barton with -PRON- bored cynical eye 
-PRON- be captain zarata -PRON- say 
peritonitis get -PRON- after all and hewell -PRON- want to talk to -PRON- alone before -PRON- slip away and -PRON- do 
-PRON- be commander of one of the battleship before disease get -PRON- and -PRON- have a good deal on -PRON- mind that need confessing 
gentleman dr cortera announce impressively guanama have be buy up by a nation across the atlantic 
guanama from one end of the coast to the other reek with a plot of such size as have rarely enter history 
and to the good of -PRON- information and belief that nation be make guanama a base of supply and when the base be all ready the say nation be go to hand a terrible wallop to unprepared america and the retired secretary of war turn as one and look at the american minister 
barton have be startle out of -PRON- stodgy calm at any rate -PRON- be hold the arm of -PRON- wicker chair and lean forward scowl at dr cortera and blink fast 
the doctor for -PRON- part gaze mild astonishment at hemmett and girton 
nothing ever surprise -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- ask 
this doesnot because -PRON- know all about -PRON- last night girton say with a faint smile 
leave -PRON- out of -PRON- cortera and convince barton that -PRON- be the truth tell -PRON- once and -PRON- imply that -PRON- be drunk 
hey 
cortera exclaim 
i er imply nothing of the sort say the american minister 
i be incredulous frankly incredulous and i be still incredulous 
this captain doctor 
be -PRON- in -PRON- right mind 
could -PRON- not have be speak in the delirium which mind be as clear as a bell up to -PRON- very last breath lead physician say incisively fool -PRON- at all on that count mr barton 
zarata know exactly what -PRON- be talk about and -PRON- weigh heavily on -PRON- conscience the existence of which i take -PRON- -PRON- discover about fifteen minute after -PRON- learn that -PRON- be at death door 
-PRON- feel that guanama be play the united state a pretty lowdown trick and -PRON- want to feel that -PRON- be do what -PRON- could to undo the work 
if the poor devil have last another hour have have information enough to stand -PRON- unfortunate little country up oh edge 
-PRON- didnot 
-PRON- have give -PRON- the main fact and have inform -PRON- that the good part of the navy and threefourth of the politician have be corrupt with large sum of real money and -PRON- be just about to give -PRON- some name when -PRON- be call to the other world 
but -PRON- all true and -PRON- all fit in with a dozen thing be observe this last week or two 
the whole country be honeycomb with bribery the new navy isnot at all 
and the national engine work out there on the point gentleman be yes hear about that hear about that barton say rise with grow agitation 
i shall act of course 
i shall act at once 
how 
girton ask crisply 
by report every detail to washington in code immediately and signify that the matter be urgent and need instant action the american minister pursue with commendable force as -PRON- move toward the door 
i be er wrong mr girton in doubt -PRON- statement apparently 
even now i can not quite believe but i will act at once 
-PRON- depart quickly 
cortera shrug -PRON- shoulder 
i wish i could have keep the poor wretch this side of the styx for another hour or two -PRON- say -PRON- beat the devil what any one with money can put across in guanama 
ten dollar and -PRON- plain citizen will swear -PRON- to eternal secrecy fifty and hell murder -PRON- own brother a hundred and hell hand -PRON- a mortgage on -PRON- eternal soul 
sometimes i think the whole low class here be like a lot of defective child and well the cure for that sort of defectiveness be spank 
hemmett snap with excusable savagery 
-PRON- be not go 
there be a gentleman down at the hospital who be expect -PRON- say cortera 
-PRON- must be under the ether by this time but i have to drop in and tell -PRON- first 
-PRON- yourself what be -PRON- go to do about -PRON- not the kind to sit passively and watch this kind of muddle go to do whatever -PRON- can do reply girton 
if barton have wake up and rouse washington perhaps well have nothing to do old man and thank 
cortera too hurry away 
for a little time hemmett and girton sat and thresh the matter out to the general end that there be really nothing to do until word have come from washington 
-PRON- be apparently begin the circle again when the telephone bell ring violently 
barton say the voice at the other end 
be that -PRON- mr girton 
-PRON- be 
do -PRON- know a man name jone sir william jone 
eh meet -PRON- yes 
who be -PRON- 
i give -PRON- up 
why 
jone sir say the american minister and -PRON- voice tremble jone come into this office mr girton sat on the edge of -PRON- desk laugh in -PRON- face sir and order -PRON- order -PRON- mr girton to send no report whatever to washington 
and i tell -PRON- to go to blaze sir and -PRON- laugh again and and threaten -PRON- 
-PRON- inform -PRON- in so many word mr girton that -PRON- personal welfare would be promote by keep complete silence 
and then helfiew some smoke in -PRON- face sir and leave 
i think -PRON- best to advise -PRON- prepare -PRON- report at this minute 
go to -PRON- old man chuckle the re376 tired minister as -PRON- hang up 
little bill jone be on the job again ne 
and somebody else be here for -PRON- state hemmett as -PRON- hurry to the door and unlock -PRON- and then start back for hat on the back of -PRON- head cigar in the corner of -PRON- mouth insolent smile on -PRON- lip william jone stand there all unannounce 
pardon -PRON- arrive this way -PRON- say easily as -PRON- enter 
the door be open and i didnot want to lose any time in get to -PRON- gentleman 
what with one thing and another this promise to be a rather busy day and i want to have -PRON- little chat with -PRON- early 
well be girton begin be profane at any rate jone smile 
i just drop in -PRON- know to get -PRON- final answer communicate with -PRON- folk overnight and able to offer a little add inducement 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- still feel that -PRON- be the man for the job and that if there s no other way of budge -PRON- i may offer -PRON- each a fifty thousand dollar bonus if -PRON- be willing to sail at one oclock 
well 
-PRON- say the retired secretary be the sneak slither agent of a railroad 
jone put in quickly 
never lose sight of that a railroad 
and since -PRON- seem to be in a truculent mood this morning come right down to case and cut out the pretty stuff 
-PRON- two be go out of this country on the one oclock steamer with -PRON- people and with -PRON- pocket full of money or -PRON- be go to be a pair of idiot and stay here and take the consequence 
get that 
there be a pause in every sense dramatic 
girton double -PRON- fist and take a step forward 
hemmett lay a hand on -PRON- arm 
just a minute steve -PRON- say 
-PRON- want to cut out the pretty stuff and well help -PRON- 
-PRON- have to take the consequence do -PRON- jone 
-PRON- certainly do 
and donot be an ass hemmett 
just well the first consequence well take be -PRON- state hemmett as -PRON- grip the gentleman two arm 
frisk -PRON- steve be carry at least oqe gun 
and then -PRON- chuckle as jone with a tremendous heave seek to wrench -PRON- loose and fail completely and -PRON- chuckle again as steve girton draw from mr pocket a pair of automatic pistol that may have hold off a mob get right down to case arenot -PRON- jone -PRON- ask go a little farther 
open that door steve 
and -PRON- if -PRON- wiggle mr jone -PRON- will get just one whack on the vulnerable spot behind the ear and after that well have to carry -PRON- 
jone glance at -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- be cool again and sneer 
-PRON- poor clod -PRON- say pleasantly -PRON- brain enough to know that -PRON- be pile up trouble for -PRON- by this idiotic trick 
i have not 
march 
where to 
girton ask 
out back to -PRON- nice new stone garage say hemmett 
that have a good look on the outside let jone cool off for a while and then decide what s come to -PRON- 
-PRON- be a curious citizen 
instead of resist -PRON- step along jauntily accept the situation as if -PRON- have not be just what -PRON- expect 
-PRON- smile too -PRON- seem to be laugh somewhere inside and now the door of the garage be open with only the runabout in sight and hemmett send the gentleman within and slam the door 
just why do -PRON- do that 
girton inquire when -PRON- be again in the library 
i want to put -PRON- where -PRON- would be accessible when -PRON- have have a chance to consider -PRON- case hemmett explain with a half smile 
upon -PRON- word steve that cuss with -PRON- assurance and -PRON- billiondollar talk make -PRON- feel queer at the bottom of the whole thing and -PRON- all so big that i havenot quite comprehend -PRON- even yet 
that man be the most dangerous enemy the united state have in all guanama 
lean back in -PRON- favorite chair gnaw -PRON- cigar -PRON- give five minute to a contemplation of the bookshelf eventually to sit erect and shrug -PRON- shoulder with third degree i guess 
what 
-PRON- isnot nice of course but i donot know that jone demand any consideration steve 
-PRON- have the eye of a physical coward too and somehow after -PRON- have hammer -PRON- around that garage for a little i believe hell be in shape to confess all -PRON- know 
and then 
then -PRON- lock -PRON- up in the garage again -PRON- boy and send a new report to washington 
oh -PRON- bizarre and unlawful and all that sort of thing i understand that much perfectly 
but be american after all steve and for the sake of the united state i think -PRON- the proper caper smile mr hemmett and gaze affectionately at -PRON- own brawny fist 
come along old man 
be -PRON- admit that stephen girton do not seek to stay -PRON- with protest 
stephen flex -PRON- own hand and sigh lightly and thus -PRON- advance upon the illstarre william jone all unaware of the elemental force -PRON- have unleash and which be about to alter -PRON- physical appearance and perhaps -PRON- mental state as well 
when this door open say mr hemmett as -PRON- slip the key into the lock -PRON- be due to make a dive straight out that way 
stand there steve and grab -PRON- 
mr girton bent forward alertly 
the door slide back and mr pose be unaltered 
nor after several second have -PRON- grip mr jone 
and now the door be wide open and the interior of the garage be visible even to the seat of the runabout and while the garage hold a pretty little american car and several kind of grease and a workbench and tool and a rack for the light robe -PRON- give no indication whatever that william jone exist on earth occur to hemmett that william jone be hide in the runabout ready to make a dash for freedom 
-PRON- crouch therefore and cover the two yard with a queer little spring -PRON- reach over the dashboard with both hand and clutch a quantity of guanaman air 
-PRON- isnot there i could have tell -PRON- that be able to look across the car since i stand outside girton say somewhat faintly 
but -PRON- but -PRON- lock -PRON- up here 
hemmett stammer 
-PRON- certainly do and just as certainly -PRON- be not lock up here now ne the retired secretary agree stand there with -PRON- mouth open like that 
ramon be watch -PRON- from the house 
well if ramon have -PRON- eye this way perhaps mr hemmett begin 
the butler be approach -PRON- small dark countenance line with perturbation 
-PRON- come to the garage -PRON- and bob -PRON- head respectfully 
there be something wrong -PRON- ask 
-PRON- be after all not the chauffeur of the sefior 
what 
ay de mi 
the fault be -PRON- the butler confess emotionally 
-PRON- come but to steal yet because of -PRON- splendid clothing i have think that -PRON- be as -PRON- say the new chauffeur of the sefior 
what do -PRON- do ramon 
hemmett ask with some difficulty 
-PRON- do but come to the kitchen sefior and ask most courteously for the key to the garage five minute back 
-PRON- say that sanchez because of -PRON- inso378 lence have be dismiss and that -PRON- have be engage 
-PRON- request the key that -PRON- may secure the can of heavy grease and -PRON- return the key within one minute senor 
yet see 
because the fault be -PRON- let what -PRON- have steal be take from -PRON- wage senor for i see oh shut up 
hemmett say wearily 
the escape could have be a little simple perhaps have william jone pause to remove the garage lock and drop -PRON- into -PRON- pocket as -PRON- enter 
william own man have have -PRON- instruction and have execute -PRON- with neatness and despatch -PRON- seem almost as if william jone have expect to find -PRON- lock in the garage and issue order accordingly ahead of time 
but whether that be the case or the man have simply be wait have see -PRON- employer imprison and have take the quick mean of get -PRON- out again jone be go 
and the point of -PRON- be just this hemmett say bitterly as -PRON- pick up -PRON- telephone in the library jone get loose because -PRON- or -PRON- man act quick steve 
that seem to be the keynote of all -PRON- performance to move like lightning and hang try to conceal anything 
why all that socalle engine work property be buy in the open and nobody think anything of -PRON- 
and the guanama navy bill be jam through the senate in the open and nobody think any thing of -PRON- 
and now -PRON- agent walk straight into -PRON- kitchen and demand the garage key and get -PRON- because ramon couldnot see anything unusual in the stunt and give -PRON- police headquarters 
hemmett wind up disgustedly 
-PRON- wait tap -PRON- foot and purposely avoid the rather sheepish smile which come to face as -PRON- ponder the late flitting of jone 
-PRON- snap headquarters 
give -PRON- domez the chief of detective 
hello 
domez 
this be mr hemmett 
ah 
the pleasure senor to serve one so august float over the wire 
cut the joy stuff retort hemmett 
domez there s a man in town name william jone a man who have the whole third floor of the new hotel and drive around town in a white automobile 
-PRON- know -PRON- eh 
well 1fti glad of -PRON- 
catch -PRON- and bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
but but the charge 
domez stammered attend to the charge and protect -PRON- if -PRON- make trouble say the american worry about that part of -PRON- 
get -PRON- 
but -PRON- be tell senor that the senor jone be a man of great wealth and influence the chief reply dubiously 
-PRON- be relate so be i a man of great wealth and influence bark mr hemmett bitterly 
i have enough of both to get -PRON- -PRON- present job domez and enough of both leave to take -PRON- away from -PRON- 
not that ask -PRON- to do anything crooked -PRON- understand 
if -PRON- round up jone guanama will be hand -PRON- medal a year from now 
but get -PRON- 
if -PRON- be possible senor 
domez agree somewhat faintly and hang up 
-PRON- be the last that cause hemmett to curse aloud for like many other recent happening that trick of hang up the receiver be almost beyond belief 
domez these many year have be the soul of respect not to say adoration 
domez at the slight word of either girton or hemmett have be in the habit of leap at the task of the moment and now without a string of compliment and assurance without so much as an apology domez have cut off the conversation 
if -PRON- didnot seem so confound silly say that domez -PRON- be in pay 
mr hemmett announce 
follow the daylong lull 
-PRON- be at liberty if -PRON- choose to tear about town in search of jone -PRON- 
-PRON- be at liberty to go to the new president of guanama and state the case and demand action -PRON- do neither 
for one thing the latter job be exclusively for another the visit be like to prove a sheer waste of time 
deep than any other man in guanama perhaps in this gigantic plot would be jose altara president of the country 
there have be much talk of fraud just after -PRON- election and curiously enough -PRON- have be only talk 
the paper with a unanimity never before in evidence have assure all guanama that not a single doubtful vote for altara have be cast and the light of recent event be shine strongly on those paper this morning as hemmett and girton discuss the situation 
-PRON- may seem farfetche yet either would have be willing to bet a portion of -PRON- wealth that not a newspaper in the country be actually own by a guanaman now 
carman and the boy return for luncheon and -PRON- be a rather silent meal the air surcharge with suspense the lovely young mrs hemmett ask question with -PRON- eye but not with -PRON- tongue the boy prattle with the cheerful irresponsibility of the threeyearold and for the first time since last evening draw attention from the crisis in affair and those of the united state 
-PRON- be a wonderful kid that edward jr 
hemmett still affirm the fact to stephen girton not less than four time daily 
-PRON- have the brainpower of a savant -PRON- make remark which for sheer wit and wisdom probably excel any other remark since child have be 
toward three -PRON- wander down to the american minister and find -PRON- in a distressed state 
barton have report to washington and be still await a reply 
-PRON- have also in a fit of energy go straight to altara and accord to -PRON- own account confront -PRON- flatly and ferociously with treachery 
the upshot of the interview have be apparently that altara have exclaim in amazement have deny all knowledge of anything of the kind have assure the representative of the great united state that an instant investigation should be set afoot and the plotter shoot as soon as -PRON- may be capture and in the next breath have inform barton unqualifiedly that none would be find because none exist 
follow this altara have slap -PRON- chest and deliver a short oration as to the eternal fidelity of guanama to america and when -PRON- leave even john barton have understand that president be lie at high speed 
evening be draw near and still no reply have come 
hemmett and girton have tired of watch barton bite -PRON- nail of hear -PRON- call up the cableoffice to learn that no official message be on the wire eventually walk back to -PRON- home 
-PRON- be in for a quiet night apparently perhaps -PRON- be in for a quiet sue month or a year 
outwardly the international affair of the united state be calm and pleasant and trouble of this kind can not be force in a minute 
then too the eventual staggering move would mean troop doubtless to be move as quietly as possible from europe to guanama and thence north when the time come 
true -PRON- may mean to move directly across the atlantic but -PRON- be all a little way in the future 
have readjust -PRON- mind to the trouble that be brew hemmett and girton be almost -PRON- again as -PRON- climb the white step to the hemmett home 
and then leave the state where -PRON- involve million of human being the mystery center suddenly on the house -PRON- 
hemmett be even laugh when a shrill cry come from the direction of the garage lately the prison of william jone 
-PRON- bring up short -PRON- turn to girton and find the latter suddenly white 
be that the kid -PRON- gasp the kid and -PRON- s hurt 
girton reply leap to the side of the house and the runway to the garage stop short then as hemmett slide to -PRON- side 
look 
look 
-PRON- point with -PRON- left hand fumble wildly for -PRON- pistol with the right 
-PRON- have leave -PRON- upstairs that morning and -PRON- cease fumble and collide with the house -PRON- as hemmett dash past 
for the boy be there in the arm of a lithe little guanaman who have pause misguidedly to try thrust a cloth into the child mouth 
wild with terror edward jr be beat at -PRON- with both little pink fist turn -PRON- curly head from side to side kicking and again manage to scream for help 
and now in the second or so that follow the scream -PRON- captor be turn to the father and look straight into -PRON- eye and since all guanama know of pistolaim since the automatic in hand be descend swiftly to shoot position -PRON- would drop the boy and seek to save -PRON- own life or no -PRON- have no intention of drop the boy after all 
with a tiger bind -PRON- make for the side of the garage and the boy be hold high between -PRON- own body and hemmett 
and -PRON- heart must lie squarely between the pinksocke leg -PRON- clutch 
edward hemmett turn to frozen steel fire and close -PRON- eye 
a drag along and still hemmett could not force -PRON- eye to look 
once upon a time -PRON- would have wager an even hundred dollar against a nickel on -PRON- chance of hit a penny at that range now for two year at least -PRON- have fire hardly a shot 
and if -PRON- have miss the mark this time a new scream of fright open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- draw breath with a gasp and dash forward and already girton have the boy in -PRON- arm and be soothe -PRON- and ask -PRON- if -PRON- be hurt and feel over the round little body 
-PRON- -PRON- didnot touch -PRON- thank god -PRON- quaver 
be -PRON- sure 
be -PRON- sure 
steve give -PRON- to -PRON- 
hemmett mouthed frantically as -PRON- snatch the boy 
sonny 
dad didnot hit -PRON- 
do -PRON- hurt anywhere sonny 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- doesnot neddy 
be -PRON- sure 
tell dad 
another shrill scream be come from the house carman this time hemmett grip -PRON- and hold the boy a little tight 
-PRON- guanaman girl have hardly conquer hysteria as yet although carman hold remarkable selfcontrol for one of -PRON- blood -PRON- own calm be very essential just now and -PRON- even contrive to smile as -PRON- beautiful wife speed to -PRON- side all right little girl -PRON- say all right 
the kid isnot hurt 
give -PRON- to -PRON- 
give -PRON- to -PRON- cry the mother as die turn shudderingly from the sight just beyond 
that man that oh 
and now the young edward hemmett be in -PRON- arm and -PRON- sob over -PRON- while girton rise to -PRON- foot after a very brief conclusive inspection of the mistaken individual who have turn abductor 
this be farewell appearance as a kidnaper -PRON- say grimly stone dead 
and better that -PRON- have die by torture 
carman cry surprisingly 
for -PRON- seek to steal -PRON- baby and there there -PRON- husband put in -PRON- decidedly white 
whatever -PRON- be -PRON- be all over now child 
take the boy in and get out of this -PRON- carman 
and -PRON- for kill -PRON- what will -PRON- do to -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot do much of anything to -PRON- -PRON- dear hemmett say grimly have to leave -PRON- here for the police steve 
come 
tell ramon to cover -PRON- 
-PRON- lead the way into the house and girton follow also decidedly jar 
mr hemmett have see -PRON- family on the way upstairs return to the telephone and demand speech with the chief of detective -PRON- be -PRON- domez -PRON- inquire 
well this be mr hemmett once more 
domez a man just try to kidnap -PRON- boy and i shoot -PRON- dead 
i want -PRON- body out of here inside of fifteen minute and after that at -PRON- service whenever -PRON- need -PRON- 
what 
no i understand that -PRON- will make thing simple for -PRON- if i have witness and get -PRON- 
and another thing domez 
i donot think as much of -PRON- or this country as i do twentyfour hour ago and i want to tell -PRON- candidly that if any one else try anything of this kind on -PRON- go to hold -PRON- personally to account

-PRON- push away the instrument with a little shudder and rise go and see how get on steve -PRON- say 
-PRON- attend tothe matter out there 
-PRON- have be attend to before hemmett return oddly attend to for that matter 
the motor patrolwagon bellmuffle have whisk around from the hill police station and directly up the drive to the garage with scant ceremony the misguided guanaman have be load aboard 
after that the suave officer who accompany the vehicle take stephen girton aside and much as if a favor have be do to the force -PRON- and to -PRON- in particular smilingly inform -PRON- that since no attention have be attract from the street the matter may be consider closed 
-PRON- be very very puzzling 
in guanama when a shooting have take place little police official be will not to swarm over the entire landscape wave hand take note and photograph question everybody summon everybody threaten everybody and assure everybody that the criminal will not only be find but also draw and quarter 
this unfortunate affair twenty minute after the shot may never have happen 
so stephen girton inform -PRON- friend when -PRON- reappear frown sorry 
hemmett mutter 
-PRON- give -PRON- the shake to think about -PRON- but what else be there to do 
the first thing that flash on -PRON- be that this be more of work steve that -PRON- be take the boy to hold for ransom and i shoot and the way the police have act bear -PRON- out too 
perhaps perhaps not more inclined to think that the man be operate on -PRON- own hook and -PRON- tooth click together -PRON- listen attentively 
there be a disturbance outside and the chattering of excited tenor and now step come toward the room and barton wildeye hatless burst in upon -PRON-

everything must have be prearrange for -PRON- say that three man step out at once and into the halliday car 
-PRON- throw a blanket or something of the sort over mrs barton and lift -PRON- bodily into -PRON- own machine and -PRON- be speed away before any one could raise a hand 
the retired secretary look at -PRON- friend

-PRON- wife -PRON- understand -PRON- wife -PRON- understand perfectly barton hemmett say quietly 
-PRON- boy all but get th same dose 
i be lucky enough to shoot the fellow who have -PRON- 
have anything of the sort be threaten 
no nor dream of 
have -PRON- be have trouble with any one barton 
mr hemmett i be positive that i havenot make an enemy since i come to this hellhole 
nor mrs barton 
why positively afraid of the native element 
barton cry have to charge -PRON- up to jone i think 
-PRON- believe that the man be so utterly abandon as to attack woman and child 
barton gasp and -PRON- be noteworthy that -PRON- faith in estimate of the jone character seem to have increase since -PRON- last meeting not quite sure what i think hemmett confess come a little too fast for -PRON- but here 
give -PRON- that telephone 
police headquarters again 
-PRON- wait impatiently until the click come from the other end of the line then domez 
yes -PRON- hemmett again 
domez have -PRON- find jone yet 
senor in all puerto carlo there be no trace of the senor jone the chief of detective inform -PRON- smoothly a lie and i think -PRON- know -PRON- 
listen domez 
the wife of the american minister have be kidnap 
yes -PRON- may well gasp 
what 
well i donot know how -PRON- be go to find -PRON- but i do know that if -PRON- donot find -PRON- -PRON- will have an american fleet shell puerto carlo inside of a week 
what 
well domez well put -PRON- in another way then 
if -PRON- havenot return that lady to -PRON- home before midnight -PRON- will reckon with -PRON- and the same gun that kill the fellow who try to get -PRON- boy 
think -PRON- over 
this time -PRON- be mr hemmett who hang up the receiver unexpectedly but there be no anger in -PRON- face as -PRON- turn back to -PRON- 
instead the slight pallor have return and eye be undeniably round 
i canot make -PRON- out -PRON- say 
unless domez -PRON- be in the very thick of the thing i canot make -PRON- out 
by all precedent -PRON- ought to have howl and protest when i talk to -PRON- that way and instead -PRON- have the cold nerve to tell -PRON- that if the american fleet turn up look for trouble -PRON- be likely to get all -PRON- come after 
fact cry girton 
almost word for word 
but -PRON- wife gentleman gasp the agonize barton 
what of -PRON- 
what do -PRON- say 
what shall -PRON- do shoulder square as -PRON- consider the unfortunate gentleman -PRON- round face fishwhite and wet with perspiration -PRON- collar wilt and -PRON- hand twitch incessantly 
-PRON- say that -PRON- would start man out at once of course -PRON- reply quietly 
that may mean everything or nothing 
as to what well do barton well get out and start the grand hunt for mrs barton -PRON- 
and i want to tell -PRON- that so far this country hasnot succeed in put over anything on girton and -PRON- 
when -PRON- start for mrs barton well bring -PRON- back in good shape or well have half this town shoot to flinder tell mrs hemmett that -PRON- s go over to -PRON- father with the boy 
fernandez be alert enough when -PRON- s rouse to danger -PRON- can shoot straight and there be at least two man servant over there who can be trust implicitly which be rare in this town just now be down in about five minute and well start 
breathe hard -PRON- climb the stair to the quiet upper floor 
now and then even in guanama thing grow too utterly outrageous and this be surely one of the time 
that the young edward hemmett have all but fall victim to the abductor be bad enough but at least that stunt have bfeen nip in the bud 
when -PRON- come to abduct the middleage wife of the middleaged and ostensibly important american minister however in the open business street yes that be carry the thing altogether too far 
mr hemmett pause at -PRON- room to slip a fresh box of cartridge into -PRON- pocket pause at room to secure that gentleman automatic and then enter -PRON- wifes bedroom maid sit there half asleep as usual while the boy a little paler but even now settle down to a picturebook sit on the floor beside -PRON- 
the senora 
hemmett say briefly 
in the boudoir senor 
the senora husband scowl about the room -PRON- finish dress for dinner 
not yet senor 
-PRON- be but half dress the maid drone 
-PRON- step into the boudoir for -PRON- diamond comb i think 
-PRON- be still there 
still eh 
how long have -PRON- be there 
these fifteen minute senor the maid inform -PRON- placidly 
mr hemmett cross to the closed door and tap -PRON- briskly 
there be no response 
-PRON- tap again 
still no sound come from beyond the portal 
carman call hemmett 
only silence answer -PRON- 
and -PRON- skin crawl suddenly -PRON- could feel -PRON- hair rise 
not of course that anything could have happen to carman upstairs in -PRON- own home but husband open the door suddenly and step into the boudoir 
-PRON- be empty 
over there a broken chair lie in three piece upon the floor and over there be one of huge cutglass toiletwater bottle upside down in the corner and unbroken 
yes and here be the torn fragment of a silk petticoat and here again be one of the comb -PRON- have wear that afternoon trample to bit 
and the door of the big closet be open and several garment be upon the floor pitch about in wildest confusion as if a violent struggle have draw -PRON- from -PRON- hanger 
and the farther door which lead to the corridor and the back stair stand wide open 
but of carman hemmett -PRON- there be no sign at all upon a time in a railroad camp just east of the rockie the sevenfoot camp bully have seek to impress -PRON- will upon edward hemmett who chance to be in charge 
-PRON- still talk about the battle out that way as one of the lively twoman affair ever stage when -PRON- be finally over friend have carry the big man down to the creek and bathe -PRON- brow for something like an hour before -PRON- return to life but at one period the outcome have be in doubt for the giant fist have land directly between edward two eye 
as concern mr hemmett the entire universe have bounce upward about three inch and settle back again with a soulshake slam and for the second time in -PRON- life -PRON- experience the same sensation as -PRON- stand in the center of boudoir 
-PRON- fist turn to ice be clench but useless at -PRON- side 
-PRON- head whirl crazily -PRON- could feel -PRON- whole body swaying ridiculously for second after second 
then blood begin to flow again and hemmett bound at the open closet 
-PRON- simply could not be go 
there have be a fight of some kind in here probably with one of the servant because servant in guanama be as prone to do the unexpected as so many dynamite bomb 
and -PRON- must have faint into that closet or no -PRON- wasnot in the closet 
hemmett have dive down and both hand have cover the floor in three second and again the crazy reeling attack -PRON- brain 
and as quickly the reeling leave 
this be no time for hysteric 
if the mysterious blight have fall upon -PRON- own wife -PRON- be the moment of all -PRON- existence ripest for quick action 
mr hemmett conquer the wild glare of -PRON- eye the tendency of -PRON- voice to rise in a shout go back to the door of the bedroom and beckon the maid 
-PRON- be a gesture so odd that -PRON- obey instantly and when the door have be close behind -PRON- and the young edward could not see hemmett grip both the girl arm and clutch -PRON- so energetically that -PRON- finger drive into the soft flesh 
-PRON- mistress 
where be -PRON- 
quick 
-PRON- -PRON- be not here the girl cry wildly 
no and -PRON- know -PRON- 
what happen in here -PRON- employer snarl 
talk hear 
talk or wring -PRON- neck 
but senor the frightened girl protest faintly 
i do not know 
i have but wait for the senora 
see 
as -PRON- find -PRON- sit so have i be sit since the senora close this door this i swear 
at at one time -PRON- seem to -PRON- that i hear a fall but i call and there be no answer 
-PRON- be not for -PRON- senor to go and open a door which this fall when do -PRON- hear -PRON- 
not five minute back senor 
one of -PRON- arm mr hemmett fling away from -PRON- the other -PRON- grip the tight and drag the girl across toward the corridor door 
-PRON- come with -PRON- -PRON- pant 
i think -PRON- be lie but -PRON- come with -PRON- 
quite unaware of -PRON- gasping and stumbling -PRON- make for the back stair and down -PRON- to the main floor 
there be a little foyer here with the kitchen and the storeroom at the side the corridor to the body of the house just behind and the back door just ahead and while -PRON- have be edward hemmett s intention to turn into the kitchen and summon every oily smirking servant in the place -PRON- halt at the open door 
part of the story at least lie out this way 
on the concrete pavement be the companion to the break comb upstairs on the pavement too lie a little torn strip of ermine fur 
-PRON- be not perhaps the only bit of ermine in guanama but -PRON- be one of a very few and as certainly as if -PRON- have see -PRON- tear away hemmett know that the white fragment have come from the wide collar of operacloak 
-PRON- very breath seem to stop 
subconsciously up to this very moment -PRON- have be try to assure -PRON- that the confusion above be merely accident that carman have step downstairs on some perfectly conventional errand now that last foolish little hope have depart and hemmett push the girl from -PRON- be out in the air and look around wildly 
there be nothing whatever to be see pavement be there and the garden beyond and the stone garage open but never a sign of carman 
-PRON- wheel about cause the maid to scream faintly and crouch into a corner as -PRON- pass -PRON- dash at the door of the only model kitchen in guanama and through -PRON- 
amid white tile and copper pot only the fat elderly elenida be visible and -PRON- as -PRON- note dizzily sit in a chair and rock whine the while 
what what hemmett choke 
what the devil the matter with -PRON- 
ramon go senor 
and evil come to this house for go where 
in the automobile the white automobile the woman chatter 
and i know that evil come to this house senor for the gift have be give -PRON- to know when these thing be to come 
-PRON- mother senor be one of seven find that gift have some redhot personal application to -PRON- if -PRON- donot calm down -PRON- employer say savagely as -PRON- shake -PRON-

why do ramon go in -PRON- 
how be -PRON- give to -PRON- to say that senor the woman choke

the eversneake listening ramon laugh as -PRON- come senor and speed away as if possess run up the stairway 
after that i do not know 
there be a struggle of some kind just overhead i think and then upon the stair a sound of foot and after that the white wagon go senor swiftly as the wind with ramon sit beside the driver 
and -PRON- senora somewhere else in the car 
hemmett force -PRON- to say 
the senora 
the woman eye roll in scared amazement

i know no more but the gift be give -PRON- early to know when evil be about to befall those who edward hemmett have leave -PRON- personal maid where be -PRON- 
-PRON- look up and down the corridor -PRON- race back to the open air and to the side of the house 
-PRON- see -PRON- flee just turn into the back street 
but at least -PRON- carry nothing and -PRON- heart bound in momentary relief for an instant an overwrought mind have assure -PRON- that even in these few second the maid have secure young edward 
straight upstairs -PRON- go without draw breath through the boudoir and into the bedroom 
the boy still sit there with -PRON- book and hemmett snatch -PRON- up and hold -PRON- fast as -PRON- make for the main stairway down this and into the room below where barton sit and wring -PRON- hand and girton speak what be intend for soothe reassuring word ready to start mr hemmett the american minister cry 
mr girton say that -PRON- wifes go too 
hemmett explode 
carman cry girton 
snatch out of this house while -PRON- be talk in this very room husband tell -PRON- ask -PRON- how -PRON- happen steve -PRON- do happen 
ramon the little devil must have race upstairs and throw -PRON- operacloak over -PRON- head and carry -PRON- down to own car evidently with jone -PRON- in -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh insanely at the sight of face 
and kill jone and kill ramon and kill every other dirty little guanaman that ever take a penny of money or hush 
hush 
hemmett fairly scream 
good god steve -PRON- any conception of what -PRON- mean to have one wife steal and yes a darned well conception than -PRON- think girton say 
well than i may have have -PRON- six month ago ne -PRON- be go to leave the boy over with -PRON- grandfather

then telephone mercede and have -PRON- come up there with -PRON- parent 
-PRON- father a pretty old man and -PRON- havenot a man servant on the place under sixty or so 
-PRON- may be silly but i canot help -PRON- 
then telephone -PRON- and donot wait here till -PRON- arrive 
hemmett snap 
i understand but time too precious now to waste one minute 
-PRON- scowl as the telephonebell ring 
-PRON- would have like to snatch girton from the room and out on the chase and -PRON- snap -PRON- finger impatiently as the retired secretary of war pick up the instrument and call mr home 
girton speaking 
well 
then while barton gnaw -PRON- fingernail and hemmett give over -PRON- fingersnapping and try to soothe -PRON- little son to still the frightened weeping that have come with these last few minute and to answer evasively the question about mother and where -PRON- have go mr girton listen impatiently for the first five second mouth opening through the next cheek whiten steadily through another five 
and have listen so long -PRON- whirl upon barton and hemmett 
mercede -PRON- shout 
ned mercede 
what be -PRON- steve get -PRON- too take mercede 
hemmett the gift for swift thinking be temporarily numb

mrs barton have be take the same way and carman too 
-PRON- grind -PRON- tooth as the diaphragm clatter frantically for a little and then -PRON- still and -PRON- white face grow more tense 
girton nodded thrice listen again and finally rang off with a groan the same thing -PRON- report wildly 
-PRON- must have be all work out in the fine detail beforehand 
mercede and -PRON- parent be come up here for dinner -PRON- know forget -PRON- 
hemmett confess 
so have for that matter 
-PRON- seem accord to -PRON- father that -PRON- be all dressed and ready even to that fuzzy white operacloak of hers 
-PRON- mother wasnot quite ready and mercede go into the garden and be walk around when -PRON- force calm break for a moment 
what else 
what else 
hemmett cry impatiently 
-PRON- -PRON- be down near the foot of the place ne and -PRON- father happen to be look that way from -PRON- window 
-PRON- say that there wasnot one second warning of what be come that -PRON- see no sign of an automobile come into the back street or anything of the kind 
that big latticed gate at the bottom of the garden open and two man shoot in throw something over the poor little kid and carry -PRON- out bodily to the white automobile that be wait 
-PRON- say that before -PRON- could even get breath enough to shout the thing be go and when -PRON- go down there as fast as -PRON- could go the little policeman who be just come up the street vow that no white car have pass hear ned 
even the uniformed police i hear hemmett answer grimly and with a calm that have come suddenly to -PRON- 
barton be on -PRON- foot 
and now let -PRON- start gentleman -PRON- cry 
in the name of heaven let -PRON- start and edward hemmett lay a hand upon -PRON- arm and smile a smile so awful that barton gulp and drop back limply 
mr barton well start just as soon as -PRON- see what be start after say hemmett be think pretty hard this last minute or two and -PRON- seem to -PRON- that perhaps a frenzied rush be just what be expect of -PRON- and the last thing to do 
the impulse yours mine be to tear out and kill everything in sight 
but mr hemmett just a minute up against something here that s look big to -PRON- every minute 
in half an hour -PRON- wife and sweetheart have be abduct in broad daylight and -PRON- be all woman of prominence and way up in guanama circle 
ordinarily a stunt like that would be enough to start a revolution and the fact that -PRON- have go about -PRON- so brazenly must mean that everything have be arrange for ahead of time 
if be to get those woman back unharmed wit will have to do the job 
but -PRON- be not go to stand here and deliver an oration about -PRON- until -PRON- have be girton begin be not 
hemmett correct sharply pick up -PRON- little son again be go to take neddfe over to -PRON- granddad and rouse fernandez steve 
meanwhile -PRON- call up the barrack and get brother colonel fernandez 
-PRON- want -PRON- here 
if the second cavalry be as absolutely right and as absolutely loyal as -PRON- have be since i put -PRON- together i want -PRON- to come up here with a full troop and stand guard on all four side of -PRON- father house 
that will take -PRON- about two minute 
then call up domez and tell -PRON- that i want -PRON- here at once 
i want domez personally steve and 
i want -PRON- here by the time return from one arm around the boy the other hand on the butt of -PRON- automatic hemmett stride out 
the street be perfectly placid as -PRON- cross 
the hour of the siesta be long over now and earlydine guanaman of the well class be stroll out on -PRON- way down to the plaza and the evening promenade and band concert 
-PRON- stare at mr hemmett and -PRON- fierceness as -PRON- salute -PRON- and for a moment -PRON- seem that none of the recent nightmare could have take place and then -PRON- be confront -PRON- fatherinlaw and bark forth the first word of the awful news and the spell be on again 
fernandez do not collapse neither do -PRON- scream or wring -PRON- hand for fernandez own a certain solidity that have go a long way toward make -PRON- the rich man in guanama 
rather -PRON- pale and listen quietly break forth for a moment in a torrent of dreadful promise for the man who have take -PRON- young daughter then control -PRON- and bade hemmett speed away and have no fear for the boy 
feel the tiny shade of relief on one count at least hemmett race back to -PRON- home 
the kid come with -PRON- entire regiment i take -PRON- girton report 
-PRON- have bugle blow before -PRON- ring off 
domez 
-PRON- say -PRON- would speed here on the wing of the wind but -PRON- didnot seem enthusiastic about -PRON- give -PRON- five minute hemmett announce glance at -PRON- watch 
i have a notion that -PRON- can learn something from -PRON- but -PRON- not worth wait longer than that on the chance 
-PRON- see domez hello 
somebody else call eh 
-PRON- pick up the telephone 
this be hemmett 
well 
this be jone say the voice at the other end 
well 
-PRON- 
-PRON- damn hound i the time to stop that sort of tommyrot be right now mr hemmett the voice interrupt and even in the surge of fury that be upon -PRON- hemmett recognize the razoredged quality of the tone 
i be a patient man -PRON- know 
i have try to be very reasonable and liberal with -PRON- hemmett and with girton and -PRON- be really quite useless 
be -PRON- calm now 
can -PRON- listen quietly to a little proposition do -PRON- think 
what 
there 
that sound much well 
mr jone assure -PRON- 
the proposition be this mr hemmett -PRON- wish -PRON- to leave the country -PRON- and your 
really -PRON- do and -PRON- no reflection at all upon yourself 
-PRON- wish -PRON- dp -PRON- understand and what -PRON- wish -PRON- have as a rule 
now the very pleasant and satisfactory way to conclude this matter the very obliging way so far as i be concern -PRON- seem to -PRON- would be for -PRON- and mr girton and mr barton and the several lady concern to leave guanama this evening on a yacht which i shall provide and which will take -PRON- to the isthmus and leave -PRON- there 
jone oh please the voice say playfully go farther have a man aboard who will hand -PRON- every penny of the splendid sum i promise hemmett who will even take -PRON- signature to the contract which i mention provide handsomely for -PRON- next ten year 
as man to man i ask -PRON- if any one could do more 
if any one who have be treat as -PRON- have treat -PRON- would do as much 
do -PRON- accept 
no roared hemmett 
and then listen and donot waste -PRON- breath yell because -PRON- will need -PRON- all for weep mr jone pursue and the change in -PRON- voice be as remarkable as have be the change in -PRON- expression during -PRON- interview an ass a poor stubborn halfwitted dolt hemmett 
a man try to treat -PRON- white and -PRON- bawl and bellow at -PRON- and let -PRON- go at that go to be out of this country before day after tomorrow all three of -PRON- 
and believe -PRON- hemmett if -PRON- be not -PRON- will receive each of -PRON- the right ear of the lady in whom -PRON- be most interested 
on the morning after that -PRON- will receive each the left ear of the same lady 
and after that mr hemmett oh -PRON- be beautiful two of -PRON- at any rate 
give -PRON- imagination full rein -PRON- will not overstep the probabilite believe -PRON- 
the word end in a ripple of sinister laughter 
choke numb and icy from head to foot unable to part -PRON- dry hard tip edward hemmett for the moment could not believe that -PRON- hear aright 
so that be really the situation and if -PRON- doubt -PRON- so much the bad for yourself and -PRON- respective lady the voice go on easily lose -PRON- chance at the money now poor fool i still give -PRON- the chance to save the woman 
do -PRON- leave this evening or do -PRON- not 
-PRON- have just one minute in which to answer 
and here the lip part jone cry mr hemmett 
as sure as there s a god above -PRON- i swear to -PRON- that if i pay for -PRON- with -PRON- life -PRON- end in a sudden gasp 
-PRON- jerk the receiverhook up and down 
get that connection again operator 
get that wire again 
a minute pass and another and another 
the diaphragm rattle faintly and hemmett hang up the receiver with tremble hand go -PRON- whisper 
that be jone and -PRON- have -PRON- 
and -PRON- say that unless -PRON- get out of the country tonight carman and mercede -PRON- could not continue nor would barton let -PRON- barton on -PRON- foot be shout then well give -PRON- what -PRON- want go man all go and tell -PRON- that hemmett afraid -PRON- too late now hemmett manage stay barton and i promise -PRON- that if -PRON- donot kill -PRON- first have the life of one in guanama that s mix up in this plot 
-PRON- be to be sure a rather sweeping statement the size of the intrigue consider 
have make -PRON- mr hemmett snatch up -PRON- hat and move toward the door and even barton shrink from before the eye that blaze in -PRON- bloodless countenance 
yet as -PRON- turn the knob the door open from the other side and -PRON- see the plump elderly elenida evidently the last remaining of the household servant and behind -PRON- the thick squat figure of domez chief of detective 
-PRON- be more than merely nervous 
-PRON- enter with what be mean for jauntiness and -PRON- smile be a ghastly thing to see

come then and -PRON- may be that even before -PRON- can start from puerto carlo the rescue may be effect 
if not well 
if not -PRON- will follow by the highroad pass the train and await -PRON- at las almas 
come 
-PRON- turn toward the door with a queer assure little jerk as if entirely certain that hemmett and the rest would follow 
for that matter mr hemmett do take a pace or two after -PRON- but only to call domez 
senor hurry away 
just wait a minute like this 
hemmett lunge 
-PRON- powerful finger wound suddenly about the amazed little man thick throat a swing and the chief of detective have be flatten face up across the heavy table 
and mr hemmett choke at -PRON- with an enthusiasm that bode ill for domez hiss stop that gurgle 
i look like an idiot domez that s evident but there be still a few people in this abandon hole who canot put anything over on -PRON- and -PRON- be -PRON- misfortune to be among the number 
senor squawk thickly from the throat 
i want the truth and i want -PRON- quick and heaven help -PRON- domez if -PRON- donot tell -PRON-

just now that 
some one else to be sure have arrive one who come into the house with a bind spoke swiftly to elenida apparently dash into -PRON- very midst 
alvarez 
girton cry 
-PRON- be indeed alvarez -PRON- friend alvarez who have be -PRON- friend year ago when first -PRON- come to guanama 
-PRON- have be a very young man in those day now -PRON- have prosper and the alvarez dock eventually bid fair to handle the bulk of puerto commerce but -PRON- be the same old alvarez honest and open as the day devote to -PRON- as -PRON- have be in the early time and now -PRON- stand with hand outstretche in wildest excitement 
senor -PRON- cry gaspingly 
the senora hemmett the lovely senorita tesoro the senora barton i think 
i have see i have see see -PRON- 
girton say 
alvarez grip -PRON- hard well aware of time value have see -PRON- -PRON- say swiftly 
at this minute -PRON- be be take from puerto carlo on the torpedoboat destroyer el fuego have press very swiftly this late afternoon 
false though -PRON- know -PRON- to be the impression of the woman be take to the hill still linger in three brain 
hence three man stare blankly at alvarez while the fourth which be domez huddle down in a corner of the room and gaze fearfully at the window 
el fuego 
hemmett stammer after a second or two 
el fuego to be sure senor the swift the racer el fuego 
i have see -PRON- with -PRON- own eye 
how 
from the roof of -PRON- no dock where man be work and where i go to see the progress -PRON- have make 
i stand there senor hemmett gaze across the harbor and as i gaze there leave the yachtclub dock a speedy tender and how long ago girton shot at -PRON- 
six minute perhaps seven -PRON- can not be long 
i come here so swiftly senor girton that police from one end of town to the other scream at -PRON- and seek to pursue -PRON- little car 
i stand there then and watch the tender and in -PRON- i see woman struggle violently two of -PRON- that be while the third the senora barton sit and weep 
a groan escape -PRON- husband stand astounded unbelieve 
alvarez race on dramatically 
havora the contractor be there as well enjoy -PRON- view with -PRON- binocular 
i snatch -PRON- from -PRON- 
i look more closely 
i be here 
and -PRON- the last place for -PRON- to be 
hemmett snarl as -PRON- dash into the library and out of the library and to the terrace overlook the harbor 
when with the exception of domez who still cower in -PRON- corner -PRON- come to -PRON- side glass be focus on midharbor 
nor have alvarez err 
ten second and the powerful lense be cut cleanly the deck of el fuego first of the new destroyer 
smoke belch from the three short funnel anchor be already up and the boat already in motion and on the deck in plain sight of all who care to look be the brilliant spot that must be operacloak 
and there gown in gray be the form of a middleage woman too yes and just come into sight lead by a white man who could be none other than william jone be a young woman in a long white cloak 
-PRON- feature -PRON- could not see at the distance nor be there any need of see -PRON- 
mercede tesoro be an intimate of the hemmett household since the early part of the season hemmett have see that same white cloak wide and voluminous spreading at the bottom 
-PRON- be mercede right 
hemmett say briefly 
-PRON- have -PRON- there and and -PRON- mean to carry out the program -PRON- threaten 
come never catch -PRON- in -PRON- motorboat 
girton cry run beside -PRON- to the step and the street 
never and -PRON- couldnot get aboard if -PRON- do steve say hemmett 
but well get -PRON- well get -PRON- or be that -PRON- car alvarez 
at the service of yourself dock and go like the devil 
hemmett direct as -PRON- leap in 
there be a roar from the motor and for a time the two most eminent american in guanama have leave -PRON- home neighborhood 
just why alvarez fail to dash -PRON- to bit on the steep hill pass explanation now and then -PRON- light car leave the ground altogether bound crazily from one side of the street to the other now and then turn a corner -PRON- seem that -PRON- be about to leave the vehicle altogether and hurtle through the window of a home and yet alvarez have not lose -PRON- smile when -PRON- come to the level part of town and with girton jabbing incessantly at the horn break every speed law ever lay down for the regulation of puerto carlo traffic 
the business section merely flit past and then the poor residential quarter 
out there in the twilight the harbor stretch away mysteriously with every now and then a glimpse of el fuego steam straight for the open sea 
hemmett jaw set be ready to leap at the yachtclubhouse before the car have even slow down and cheerfully abandon -PRON- property alvarez dart after at side 
there be a certain mistaken attendant who come forward smile and bow and smirk to welcome the eminent member 
because of -PRON- error in bow directly before hemmett -PRON- pick -PRON- up from the far corner of the big assembly room vaguely of the impression that a tropical earthquake have take place and while -PRON- be still sit on the floor edward hemmett have leap into the beautiful cedar boat and be work over the engine while alvarez and girton drag back the canvas cover 
and -PRON- be off 
spray whirl up in a white mass settle then until -PRON- seem that a sheet of clear glass stand high above either side of the speedboat the expensive exquisite craft whirl out into the harbor with hemmett camp grimly behind -PRON- automobile stere wheel 
just once girton manage where 
destroyer pavoroso 
hemmett shout 
only thing afloat around here that will catch -PRON- 
then -PRON- push spark and throttle forward to -PRON- last notch and bend -PRON- head before the wind and so -PRON- whiz down puerto carlo harbor and directly to the side of the pavoroso companion destroyer to the el fuego 
but two or three sailor be visible languid and not greatly interested until the speedboat come directly alongside 
as the motor stop however the trio above quicken and grow visibly excited and expectant of just what 
mr hemmett would have give much to know as -PRON- climb the short ladder cast one backward glance at alvarez busy with secure the motorboat and barked mozo 
where be -PRON- 
el capitan senor 
-PRON- be ashore the sailor nearest respond 
so much the well in command of the craft steve 
drill any man who disobey or try to leave 
alvarez 
senor 
get into the wirelesshouse quick 
if there s nobody on duty stay there and keep every one out 
if there be any one there see that -PRON- doesnot work the apparatus the engineroom 
i see 
and have apparently take over the boat for -PRON- own purpose these lhst twenty second -PRON- be go 
-PRON- have be aboard the pavoroso on the day of -PRON- first come when the reception be tender and -PRON- have agree heartily at the time that guanama have acquire the fast thing in destroyer and -PRON- remember the general layout 
so -PRON- come that reach the chief engineer office in rather less than another twenty second mr hemmett walk in and snap -PRON- finger at the portly ornately uniformed official who smoke in the easy chair 
-PRON- rodero 
how much steam have -PRON- 
steam senor 
oh -PRON- be the senor hemmett say the chief and the queer insolence -PRON- have see in other quarter be before hemmett again 
i have think senor that -PRON- have leave guanama 
no 
steam steam what 
a pound or two perhaps 
no more 
the fire be bank senor and why do -PRON- ask 
because interested 
snatch down that telephone and tell -PRON- to have a running head of steam in those boiler as quick oh but -PRON- good senor hemmett the chief smile flatly and impudently 
how can -PRON- be that one accept order from -PRON- 
-PRON- new president have appoint -PRON- the secretary of the navy perhaps or give -PRON- command of the pavoroso tell -PRON- how -PRON- can be that one accept order from -PRON- the caller explain as -PRON- automatic press directly over the chief heart as the chief -PRON- turn white abruptly raise heavy arm hastily 
i canot waste time explain the matter rodero but i can tell -PRON- one thing -PRON- will have this boat run under a full head of steam without lose more than one second or kill -PRON- and take charge of this end -PRON- 
which 
-PRON- be of course insane 
the chief engineer who entertain a hearty respect for armed lunatic do indeed snatch down -PRON- telephone and the sincerity of the word -PRON- utter into -PRON- almost warm chilling heart 
and have utter -PRON- -PRON- drop back in -PRON- chair scared and perspiring and the cold blue of edward eye drill through -PRON- very soul 
el fuego have just start out of the harbor bind for i donot know where say the owner of the eye go to overhaul -PRON- or blow up this boat and if through any fault of -PRON- -PRON- do neither -PRON- will not come back 
-PRON- know -PRON- pretty well rodero 
if -PRON- want to take a chance on any tricky stuff take -PRON- 
below coal be rattle and shovel scrape and if rodero know mr hemmett -PRON- be more certain that hemmett know rodero 
in the wellfille rank of fullblown guanaman coward rodero be among the bright light 
judge by -PRON- present expression the odd that -PRON- would try disobedience be perhaps one to five hundred and hemmett accept -PRON- with a grunt and hurry back to the deck 
girton after a fashion have take command 
some thirty of the crew be stand there regard -PRON- silently as -PRON- address -PRON- too silently and in a surly fashion that be far from reassure 
touch by the unusual mood that have grow so curiously prevalent the crowd look downright ugly 
girton turn to -PRON- friend and snap in english safe to risk -PRON- with this gang 
be there any other way of risk -PRON- 
but yes senor 
alvarez put in unexpectedly 
there be indeed another way for even i can be of assistance 
even though -PRON- be possible i pray that -PRON- do not start until i return 
-PRON- have leave -PRON- 
-PRON- have go over the side like a monkey and be down in motorboat and back away from the long thin destroyer 
somewhat dazedly hemmett watch -PRON- go wonder just where -PRON- may be head observe that -PRON- be make directly for -PRON- own dock and turn to find that the destroyer crew on -PRON- own initiative have move forward in a body 
what do -PRON- say to -PRON- steve 
hemmett ask tell -PRON- that -PRON- be go to sea and that -PRON- be under -PRON- order and -PRON- hardly make a sign one way or the other 
one of the devilish little petty officer laugh and shrug -PRON- shoulder and that be about all 
and if -PRON- try anything rough there will be three of -PRON- to handle thirty or forty of -PRON- provide that alvarez get back 
hemmett mutter 
-PRON- turn and peer through the thickening twilight to the harbor mouth and the atlantic beyond 
the stern of el fuego be just vanish as -PRON- head down the coast and behind -PRON- lie a heavy trail of black smoke 
-PRON- may not have be a sob that escape hemmett -PRON- be at any rate a sound that cause hand to rest rather suddenly on -PRON- arm and girton to say let -PRON- think about -PRON- i know that sound ridiculous but -PRON- the only way to keep from go mad just now 
when i look at that crew and see the way some of -PRON- be look at -PRON- and consider the way a guanaman crew ought to look at one of -PRON- why for a second or two i be on the very verge of pull the gun wipe out such of the little rat as i could and then go down in a fight with the rest the sort of mental state well have to avoid old man if be ever if be ever -PRON- -PRON- have to pause for a moment 
hemmett breathe deeply 
well be go to bring the girl back or be not come back -PRON- if that s what -PRON- mean -PRON- say 
this little pesthole of a country have never beat -PRON- yet steve and -PRON- canot beat -PRON- now 
but -PRON- close to -PRON- at this minute than -PRON- have ever come before 
girton snllle bitterly 
side by side -PRON- gaze through the gloom toward the alvarez dock 
the speedboat have disappear long before this and the smokecloud overhead be grow very dense 
in a very few minute the gage below would show a head of steam and if alvarez have not reappear when there be pressure enough to send the engine into action there would be two man against the crowd instead of three 
although from the thick evening mist near the alvarez dock that gentleman -PRON- certainly seem to be return now 
the foggy white spot be the spray of the speedboat but the spray and the motion of the craft behind -PRON- be different now 
ordinarily mr marine wonder almost soar over the surface of the water whereas -PRON- be almost wallow now 
-PRON- owner and -PRON- friend step to the other rail and strain -PRON- eye load down steve 
hemmett mutter 
yes and with man breathe the retired secretary of war 
look at -PRON- 
there must be fifteen of -PRON- jam up forward and there be as many more aft 
silently -PRON- watch and be -PRON- admit thrill a little 
if -PRON- be a relief expedition alvarez be a wonder 
-PRON- have be go all tell perhaps eight minute and now -PRON- be come alongside again the highspeed engine hammer viciously under -PRON- unusual load 
and now -PRON- have cease hammering and the crew of the pavoroso be stream aft and alvarez before -PRON- throw out -PRON- hand and smile a glorify smile 
-PRON- be do senor -PRON- report 
to sacrifice the beautiful boat be a sin yet -PRON- can not drown these pig who have elect to laugh at the great senor girton 
-PRON- will stand back senor 
-PRON- be more than a request and -PRON- be already stand back for over the side of the pavoroso swarm uncouth man great husky man picd for -PRON- job as heavyweight dockworker large tough man in shirt and flap linen trouser who go to work without one second delay as alvarez -PRON- employer bark command 
the general sense gain by hemmett and girton during those dizzy second be that the regular crew be be order into and then throw bodily into the speedboat 
fist fly here and there for a moment some one fire a shot and thank to a dreadful uppercut from a brown fist topple over the side with the smoking pistol still in -PRON- hand 
a whiteface little officer evidently first assistant engineer come trot to report that steam be up and the anchor weigh nor have -PRON- more than stammer the word and hurry away than the quiver of engine shake the vessel 
and fifty yard astern the packed motorboat with -PRON- yelling snarl passenger drift toward the shore 
the pavoroso shake again 
the fifty yard widen suddenly 
the chase be on 
a be the psychological distinction between motion and the lack of motion girton and hemmett feel -PRON- spirit rise higher with every turn of the highpowere engine 
carman mercede and wife may be in a position quite as perilous as heretofore or even more perilous if jone chance to resent the pursuit but at least help be come nearer to -PRON- every minute now 
the destroyer surge out between the crescent point of the harbor and head south in the brilliant light of the rise tropical moon before -PRON- quite realize that the thing have be accomplish and that alvarez be miss 
-PRON- turn up suddenly smile 
all seem well senor -PRON- report brisklv 
eh 
i have visit every part of the vessel save the engineroom which seem to be work nicely 
there be on deck no more than six or seven of the crew for many be ashore on leave and these six or seven have feel the hand of -PRON- man be humble and willing to obey -PRON- be a wonder alvarez 
girton mutter 
to serve yourself senor that be a joy the young man state with a smile 
later perhaps these man of mine will be of further service and upon -PRON- -PRON- may depend for -PRON- be try and true fighter loyal to -PRON- which mean loyal to yourself 
i speak -PRON- obey 
what be next to be do 
there be something distinctly helpful about alvarez with -PRON- excited smile and -PRON- utter confidence in the force -PRON- have precipitate so astonishingly on the destroyer pavoroso 
look at -PRON- -PRON- be rather difficult to believe that all would not end well and hemmett even smile faintly 
-PRON- may be as well for both of -PRON- to leave this rail and give up try to see a vessel already out of sight -PRON- say and find out just what -PRON- have get aboard the wireless man alvarez 
small and easily cow 
alvarez report 
-PRON- be smoke in -PRON- little cabin senor when -PRON- come aboard with the telephone on -PRON- ear and evidently expect something 
-PRON- will now find -PRON- somewhere outside -PRON- cabin and here be the key 
-PRON- will take -PRON- 
i may need -PRON- and hemmett drop -PRON- into -PRON- pocket leave -PRON- in charge of the deck alvarez and see the navigate officer 
the ship isnot steer -PRON- i take -PRON- 
young arturo polito be in charge 
-PRON- remember -PRON- professional fat boy eh 
girton say 
i remember -PRON- very well 
-PRON- graduate from -PRON- naval college i remember that too because i indorse -PRON- application 
hemmett at -PRON- side -PRON- walk to the wheelhouse and open the door 
polito be indeed -PRON- only tenant a very plump and sleepyeye young brown man goodnature as ever 
-PRON- greet -PRON- with mingled emotion for -PRON- among some thousand of other have much cause to be loyal to guanama 
so -PRON- be in -PRON- too eh 
mr hemmett observe 
in -PRON- and out of -PRON- again senor apparently say the second officer of the pavoroso quite easily 
many strange thing have happen recently in -PRON- navy senor thing about which one may ask question and learn nothing 
i have intend in another week or two to ask for -PRON- discharge and join -PRON- father in business for i do not like strange thing 
and now a few minute go the excellent senor alvarez point a pistol and inform -PRON- that on pain of death -PRON- be to catch el fuego 
so now if -PRON- understand that much -PRON- have get -PRON- all polito girton say sharply 
can -PRON- overhaul the boat 
-PRON- be possible -PRON- be not likely polito say placidly as -PRON- kindle a fresh cigarette 
on the trial -PRON- know el fuego average the tenth part of a mile better than this vessel 
that be the difference 
then get busy with -PRON- engineroom telegraph and see if the pavoroso canot make that extra tenth -PRON- and a little more 
because be go to overhaul el fuego 
-PRON- steady eye bore into the large cowlike orb of polito some ten second polito study the gaze and the face of the man behind -PRON- and then with a little shiver -PRON- nod 
yes senor say -PRON- plainly convince 
if -PRON- be within human power -PRON- be to overhaul el fuego 
be assure of -PRON- poor good effort to that end 
-PRON- pick up the speakingtube and take to shout energetically and sincerely as rodero have shout to -PRON- fireroom force 
hemmett and girton a little easy leave -PRON- and walk forward where alvarez already peer into the night ahead 
i have order the searchlight man -PRON- report 
-PRON- be one of the wonder of the navy this pavoroso searchlight 
with -PRON- and the moon -PRON- shall soon pick up el fuego i think 
-PRON- be wrong 
the searchlight flare out after another two or three minute sweep the water ahead all in vain 
east of -PRON- path -PRON- go and west through painful minute 
there be no sign of el fuego 
half an hour have go then and abruptly a pencil of light rise on the skyline dead ahead rise and disappear again -PRON- 
mr girton exclaim 
and -PRON- be make for the open sea -PRON- be head east add -PRON- friend 
in that senor i think -PRON- be wrong alvarez smile 
i have have speech with one barra head of the fireroom 
-PRON- speak freely to -PRON- senor for -PRON- be old friend 
-PRON- be say by barra that the other destroyer be make straight for parilla to take on coal 
eh 
and i think that this be true senor because coal for el fuego be lie at -PRON- own dock and be to have be take aboard tomorrow 
and the bunker here 
-PRON- be full senor 
well that sound something like 
girton exclaim 
that ought to mean that well overhaul -PRON- before midnight 
before eleven i should say senor alvarez answer cheerfully 
again -PRON- anxious heart quicken again as the searchlight be switch off at last -PRON- take to peer through the soft moonlight reach 
-PRON- be do all that lie within the pavoroso several trip below at regular interval prove that much 
whatever affiliation with the plot that bid fair to make guanama the ranking traitor nation of history the chief engineer be accept this evening at -PRON- full face value 
the periodical visit below of hemmett may have have something to do with -PRON- or the three square jaw tattere stevedore who stand about the engineroom at any rate -PRON- be certain that another pound of steam would rend the boiler 
-PRON- have be head south for an hour and now -PRON- have be head south for two hour and more and despite -PRON- good effort fear be creep into the heart of each man that alvarez have be wrong and that el fuego be not bind for parilla and coal 
-PRON- searchlight after that one flash have not reappear and terrify pessimism be work -PRON- way to lip when alvarez cry suddenly there senore 
there 
see 
the smoke to starboard 
-PRON- be run not a mile from the coast 
do -PRON- see 
the moon be come from a fiveminute obscurity behind thick scurrying cloud and through the grow light -PRON- strain -PRON- eye again and el fuego be there surely enough 
plow along far far ahead that thin dark spot with the thin white wake must be el fuego and hemmett fairly bound into the wheelhouse and hurl at the sleepyeyed polito over there 
can -PRON- pick -PRON- up with the searchlight 
-PRON- should be possible senor 
try -PRON- 
tense second and the white stream shine across the rolling ocean nose about for a bit and rest steadily upon the destroyer ahead and to -PRON- excited eye -PRON- seem that even in the second el fuego have lose ground 
-PRON- be near by quarter of a mile or be -PRON- only two hundred yard or be -PRON- anything at all 
mr hemmett give -PRON- up and dash toward the wirelesshouse where the philosophical operator still sit upon the step and smoke 
wake up -PRON- shout 
here 
the door open get in there and call el fuego 
a message senor the operator say calmly 
a message for jone yes i see that -PRON- know jone 
get -PRON- -PRON- and tell -PRON- to stop that s all 
tell -PRON- to stop or well sink -PRON- -PRON- man and remember that stand here beside -PRON- and that i spend several year in wireless work and that if -PRON- begin send code or anything else mysterious -PRON- will go overboard and do the send -PRON- 
consider that -PRON- one attempt to learn the mystery of the continental wireless alphabet have be a dismal failure the statement be a slight exaggeration yet -PRON- go well enough 
the operator have absorb some of this evening atmosphere aboard the destroyer -PRON- seat -PRON- obediently and set -PRON- quench sparkgap to hiss and crackle softly 
-PRON- adjust -PRON- tune apparatus and wait 
once more -PRON- call once more -PRON- wait and this time -PRON- smile slightly 
-PRON- be listen -PRON- report 
-PRON- refuse to take a message 
how can -PRON- 
hemmett snap 
how can one force -PRON- to take a message when the telephone be thus easily remove the operator smile blandly lay aside -PRON- own 
-PRON- put those back on -PRON- head and send -PRON- a message whether -PRON- acknowledge -PRON- or not command mr hemmett 
tell jone to stop or well sink -PRON- yes and put an add point to -PRON- too

fire -PRON- be -PRON- job steve 
can -PRON- get the range 
in a minute or two say girton without great enthusiasm 
-PRON- could not forget that mercede tesoro be a prisoner aboard el fuego -PRON- could not drive from -PRON- mind the fact that this be the ocean and that -PRON- really deep artillery study of recent year have be all upon land 
up at las alma in the training day of the army both as an example and because the practise interest -PRON- deeply the secretary of war have personally pile up a score at the target which still stand unmatched but this well this be different

ready 
girton announce simply 
let -PRON- go 
there be a flash and a roar and a shock that set the slender bow of the pavoroso to quiver and six hand clasp at the rail while six eye dart down the path of the searchlight to el fuego 
and a cry escape three mouth for there be a splash and a spurt of white water just ahead of the other destroyer and el fuego even when -PRON- have stare hardly breathe through another minute show no sign of come to a standstill -PRON- see -PRON- 
hemmett mutter wonderingly 
-PRON- see -PRON- fast enough but jone be aboard that boat say girton 
-PRON- neednot stop at that get the range business down to a hair breadth 
well 
the next one go through -PRON- engineroom ned

-PRON- will not sink girton smile stop though and -PRON- will shut -PRON- watertight compartment in a hurry and by the time -PRON- have be shut -PRON- ought to be alongside and board -PRON- 
alvarez all enthusiasm all faith be even now draw out another shell and another fire charge and although the very notion send chill up and down hemmett s spine -PRON- offer no objection 
tooth set -PRON- watch girton tinker -PRON- rangefinder delicately almost unbreathingly and the wireless man be beside -PRON- with a fluttering bit of paper 
-PRON- have answer senor -PRON- cry 
i have send as -PRON- request and -PRON- have reply 
edward hemmett snatch the paper from -PRON- and hold -PRON- in the faint reflect light from the searchlight 
-PRON- be address to -PRON- and -PRON- read the woman be lash to the afterdeck 
the boat and every man on board be ready to leave 
if -PRON- wish to sink el fuego sink -PRON- be ready senor 
alvarez be say tensely 
-PRON- watch the spot beside -PRON- engineroom and -PRON- will see mr girton be just begin 
well donot 
hemmett shout 
-PRON- -PRON- here wireless 
get back there and say say nothing at all until i give the word 
girton turn somewhat blankly from -PRON- gun 
what now 
jone say that all hand be ready to leave steve which mean that if -PRON- put a hole through -PRON- -PRON- wonot bother with the compartment 
and the woman be lash down tight 
the gunner enthusiasm cool ruptly 
-PRON- hand drop and -PRON- smile bitterly 
jone always seem to have something ready doesnot -PRON- 
-PRON- coal give out too and -PRON- s slow down 
look at that 
yes and since -PRON- s so handy with the ultimatum stuff have a try at -PRON- -PRON- 
hemmett storm be alongside in another five minute and go to warn -PRON- that -PRON- break off and speed after the radio man 
-PRON- find that person sit before -PRON- instrument telephone already adjust and smile interestedly 
the operator hold up a restraining hand moment sefior -PRON- cry softly 
more be come now 
-PRON- pencil scratch ahead and hemmett scowl over -PRON- shoulder watch the word and damn -PRON- own early lack of persistence in matter telegraphic 
-PRON- mind would have be easy could -PRON- have but read those click and buzz audible even with the telephone on the man head 
-PRON- be come to anchor grow swiftly to -PRON- will drop anchor at least five hundred yard astern 
should -PRON- fail to do this or should -PRON- choose in any way to attack el fuego the woman will be shoot in cold blood before -PRON- can possibly reach -PRON- 
this time the signature of william jone be add and have scrawl -PRON- the operator look up 
-PRON- have sign off senor -PRON- report 
that be the end of the message 
without a comment mr hemmett snatch -PRON- from the table and leave the little cabin 
a moment only -PRON- hesitate as at the door of the wheelhouse -PRON- gaze across the black water el fuego be glide to a full stop and -PRON- be come very very near to -PRON- now 
the distance between be surely less than half a mile and should jone happen to estimate -PRON- as less mr hemmett bark an order at polito which set the engineroom telegraph go denly and hurry to -PRON- friend still in the bow still gaze at el fuego stop girton say superfluously the matter with this tub 
engine bust stop too mr hemmett snarl 
here read -PRON- 
glass be not need now to watch el fuego 
the moon have disappear again and the searchlight show the motionless destroyer against a background of solid impenetrable black and show as well the bustling about toward the stern where hang the gasoline tender 
whatever -PRON- purpose -PRON- be make ready to lower away the little boat 
man be scramble in to the number of half a dozen guanaman sailor all by -PRON- uniform then distant and tiny the figure of jone advance and climb into the tender and after -PRON- a man in civilian tog whom -PRON- have not see before 
the tender slide to the black water and -PRON- catch the faint hum of the engine read -PRON- girton mutter as -PRON- eye go back to el fuego come aboard here 
yes and the other boat be swing out from el fuego and -PRON- s settle too say hemmett 
settle 
look at -PRON- 
-PRON- hasnot take on any cargo since -PRON- start steve but -PRON- s half a foot lower in the water 
silently -PRON- study the new phenomenon for a little while the tender hum through the night toward -PRON- 
-PRON- have cover half the distance before girton come to the end of a new train of thought speak softly alvarez 
yes senor and the young man come closer 
have -PRON- drop that long boat on the port side and have -PRON- do quick 
then pick -PRON- a dozen of -PRON- man who can scrap 
see 
i understand senor 
and then deal -PRON- out the pistol from the arsenal below 
-PRON- be all armed senor 
then go to take -PRON- over and officially capture el fuego as soon as jone set foot on this deck 
mr girton say simply 
if i ever stand here and look at -PRON- and think about the girl hemmett nod quickly 
i have think of the same thing -PRON- say 
take alvarez with -PRON- and beat -PRON- steve have the searchlight keep off the water and when -PRON- have matter in -PRON- own hand start the wireless 
make dot and nothing else -PRON- can manage that 
inasmuch as be give lesson in field wireless yes 
and if -PRON- need help simply point the searchlight at the sky and leave -PRON- there because i shall be able to quit jone and come to help -PRON- about three minute after -PRON- have board -PRON- not go to slaughter the man 
heaven forbid 
mr hemmett say grimly go to hang on to -PRON- if i can until i see who s with -PRON- and hear what -PRON- have to say and i think i can 
the searchlight switch around to reveal the tender not fifty yard distant and make gracefully for the destroyer 
hemmett bit off the word and stephen girton be go 
-PRON- hear girton cross the dock hear the soft pattering of many foot and the creak of pulley and presently the faint little splash 
mr hemmett step to the man at the searchlight and snap an order -PRON- white beam rise and hang over the top of el fuego in purposeless fashion and up from the starboard landingstage in the most fashion william jone be step to the deck of the destroyer 
calmer or more pleasantly smile no man could have be 
an assure lazy little swagger be in -PRON- walk and -PRON- shoulder swing to -PRON- 
behind -PRON- in the faint illumination of the destroyer decklight stand a short thickset guanaman and for an instant as -PRON- view the latter fury at jone almost subside for that be jose canita new president of the national bank of guanama a millionaire who rank almost with fernandez a mighty hidden power in the darker more mysterious depth of politic and sometimes mention as the most powerful one man in all guanama pigeye oily -PRON- smile directly and significantly at edward hemmett and in less than five second hemmett feel queerly -PRON- have learn more about the plot more about the recent election than -PRON- have ever know before 
-PRON- dear mr hemmett eh 
jone observe easily 
oh -PRON- know the excellent canita donot -PRON- 
i wish -PRON- wouldnot look at -PRON- just like that hemmett -PRON- isnot politic 
-PRON- may insist on have -PRON- take back and sentence to death by one of -PRON- pet judge or something like that dear stephen girton 
-PRON- didnot come 
hemmett snap 
well -PRON- really 
jone smile 
be superb vitality ebb that -PRON- funk the spectacular chase 
i could have swear that -PRON- would be with -PRON- ready to eat the whole world raw andhello 
what the devil kind of crew have -PRON- here -PRON- conclude with genuine interest as -PRON- gaze at the tattered group of overdeveloped dock worker that hover near the substitute crew hemmett say let -PRON- alone unless oh -PRON- will let -PRON- alone without any unless jone assure -PRON- 
well mr flemmett calmer i observe nice be look at el fuego i believe these last minute 
be -PRON- necessary to outline the situation in mere word 
-PRON- be not rasp accent put in 
-PRON- be not a fool senoi hemmett 
-PRON- be ready now i think to do the wise thing 
the wonderful senor jone will still guarantee that -PRON- and the woman shall be deliver safely at the isthmus 
-PRON- be most gdnerous 
-PRON- be more than i should do 
because if that bullheade dementia still possess -PRON- the little game will end here and now hemmett jone pursue 
upon -PRON- word -PRON- donot seem very intelligent after all 
do -PRON- quite realize that the seacock on el fuego be open and water come into -PRON- hull at the rate of an inch every minute or so -PRON- eye tell -PRON- that -PRON- man be in the boat ready to leave when the boat -PRON- come to the water level -PRON- really believe that -PRON- lady be truss to the rail over there hemmett 
-PRON- saunter nearer and look at mr hemmett interestedly 
now -PRON- have get about ten minute to decide -PRON- explain 
guanama doesnot need -PRON- hemmett -PRON- or girton 
neither do the er railroad which i have the honor to represent still let -PRON- have -PRON- lady intact take -PRON- to the yacht i mention aboard this very boat hemmett 
and please donot glare a dreadful and desperate character but all by -PRON- little self i still have -PRON- where the hair be very short 
-PRON- canot give a particle of assistance to the unfortunately sink el fuego old chap because -PRON- canot get there 
even if -PRON- whole somewhat shabbylooking crew here be to pile into the small boat -PRON- would really avail nothing at all because -PRON- own crew have order to fire on everything and anything -PRON- own tender except that come in sight 
-PRON- take the general sense of the argument sure 
now what i propose be this -PRON- will come with -PRON- to el fuego as hostage get the lady and well get -PRON- crew 
-PRON- own remarkable crowd here will put out for the shore 
and then well turn around and steam back to puerto carlo and -PRON- will have a pleasant trip on a nice yacht just as soon as have mr girton sandbag and bring aboard 
and -PRON- will have the positive assurance that if -PRON- ever show -PRON- face again in guanama -PRON- will be shoot on sight 
do i seem to exaggerate 
-PRON- be a wrong impression believe -PRON- 
sweeping change be come in guanama oh so soon 
well 
these last few second hemmett have be strain -PRON- ear for sound across the water 
when -PRON- come something inside inform -PRON- there be certain thing which -PRON- would do in a fraction of time less than measurable 
but -PRON- have not come yet 
and the fact that -PRON- be american citizen jone -PRON- begin old stuff dreary old stuff these day 
jone say impatiently 
if -PRON- be nasty -PRON- will be dead citizen -PRON- know and dead or alive -PRON- may be entirely sure that no credible word will ever come to -PRON- precious united state 
if -PRON- live and raise a rumpus -PRON- will find officially that -PRON- be expel from guanama for arson or grand larceny or something of the sort 
if -PRON- die pouf 
i control every mean of communication out of guanama 
i control every newspaper in the country 
i con across the water a wild chorus of yell rise suddenly and wild than any of -PRON- be edward own yell aboard the pavoroso where one swell head be smash thunder mr hemmett as -PRON- plunge at mr jone across the black water stephen girton gaze hard at the moon and draw a breath of relief 
that cloud be grow thicker toward the center and the moon would remain behind -PRON- for all of fifteen minute 
and -PRON- seem to have leave the pavoroso without attract attention 
jone be aboard too by this time 
-PRON- tender be bob at the ladder and girton hold -PRON- breath once more as -PRON- watch the three or four sailor in -PRON- and pray fervently that the almost inaudible plashing of oar may not reach -PRON- across that bare two hundred foot of black water 
and then -PRON- ease for -PRON- be quite absorb in -PRON- own chatter smoking laugh -PRON- sit about the engine pit and now the danger virtually be over 
and the job that lie ahead be not exactly without danger 
behind -PRON- be some dozen of man armed fighter by preference but on el fuego what may -PRON- find 
the little destroyer be always undermanned and shoreleave prompt by universal sympathy with the guanaman thirst be a chronic evil of the navy but -PRON- be entirely possible that forty or fifty armed man be await -PRON- come not that -PRON- matter very much save as concern the chance of quick success 
with mercede aboard el fuego the power of evil -PRON- would only have invite mr girton to battle tonight 
-PRON- whisper order a little more speed -PRON- look very thoughtfully at the face about -PRON- and then glance up at the light -PRON- note that -PRON- be fairly under the stern of el fuego and slide around to the starboard side and the ladder 
and just overhead now 
why man be swarm out of the small boat there 
-PRON- have be detect at last and -PRON- be bump the side and -PRON- own man be rise as one and mr girton automatic in hand bound up the ladder to el deck 
the very suddenness of -PRON- advent seem to have paralyze those nearest -PRON- 
tooth bare gun for the moment forget the pentup emotion of the evening explode within stephen girton 
there be a dark face near and a riflebarrel -PRON- fist obliterate the dark face and the rifle fly overboard 
and behind -PRON- there be yell and the jostling of -PRON- own man and a shot or two and after that for a little hade -PRON- break loose 
although for girton -PRON- be a joyful infernal region 
-PRON- fist be swinge and swirl pound and hammer ecstatically 
man be yell and man be fall in a twinkling instant -PRON- see raporta first officer of el fuego narroweyed and savage fire a shot at one of the dock worker see the first officer lift bodily and send crash to the deck senseless see a knife come in -PRON- own direction and hear the crazy scream as -PRON- grip the arm and all but tear -PRON- from -PRON- socket see patero mighty of the stevedore as three man drag at -PRON- see patero hurl one out of sight along the deck and the other bodily into the near outhange cutter see -PRON- grip the neck of the third and squeeze and shake until the bulgingeye face vanish from mr ken in a new surge of battle 
another knife be come -PRON- way and -PRON- leap toward -PRON- and laugh madly for -PRON- very expression seem to have frighten the sense out of this late member of el crew and -PRON- have throw away the knife and be run to the side see three more come at -PRON- head down and leap at -PRON- as well bleed fist hurl at -PRON- like two triphammer 
there be perhaps nothing really civilized or intellectually uplifting in any of -PRON- but the fact remain that all thing consider stephen girton have not enjoy -PRON- so thoroughly in a long long time 
and then why -PRON- be slam and punch at the empty air and a dockman with one eye close and a cheek badly cut be grin at -PRON- and say enough senor 
-PRON- have flee 
see one and all -PRON- have go and those that could not flee be throw after into the boat 
eh stammered mr girton 
and the woman senor 
-PRON- have be liberate and -PRON- be unharmed for -PRON- say no more 
girton in one second have come to -PRON- sense have look about swiftly and have mercede tesoro in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- be a heartstopping moment 
the civilized element in girton well up and silently and fervently -PRON- give up thank as -PRON- press the frightened sob girl to -PRON- 
-PRON- be the first tear that mercede have shed since that astounding rpoment at the foot of the garden as these be the first tear of carman hemmett stand by mrs barton and strive to still the hysteria that have afflict the old lady ever since the beginning of the amazing adventure 
stephen girton return to life quite suddenly 
patero white and breathless still be tap -PRON- arm 
senor -PRON- say 
the vessel be sink 
what 
-PRON- be say by miguelo that the seacock have be open 
-PRON- would ask if the senor would know how -PRON- may be close 
girton blink bit -PRON- lip 
i donot know -PRON- confess 
get the searchlight into action and if -PRON- need electricity senor -PRON- be impossible say patero 
water be in the fireroom and the engineroom 
this much i have see but if there be other power perhaps if there be i donot know how to find -PRON- 
girton tell -PRON- no marine engineer and unusual man that -PRON- be in the vastness of -PRON- relief -PRON- laugh outright have to take to the boat and get back to the pavoroso 
and that too be impossible for the boat be go even to the one in which -PRON- come say the dockman energetically 
and more evil than this have be the act of the crew senor 
to the last lifebelt every mean of keep afloat have be cast overboard -PRON- be the work of murderer and -PRON- should have understand when -PRON- see the two chest hurl into the sea but in the great turmoil laugh have die altogether 
so have excite flood of word up to this minute continue in spite of patero 
a tremendous stillness seem to settle on the deck of el fuego 
do -PRON- mean to say girton demand thickly that this thing go down and that -PRON- have no mean of get off 
with the shore two mile away senor 
then yell cry mr girton 
yell like blaze for help and patero smile forlornly 
help from the pavoroso 
the night wind blow squarely in -PRON- face from that quarter senor how the thing have happen edward hemmett could not recall but jone be lie there at -PRON- foot senseless and bruised and very unwholesome to look upon 
canita have suffer too canita lie huddle down by the hatch weeping queerly and apparently unable to move and the senseless figure over there wear the cap of el fuego as do three other who be be hold by the pavoroso s scrub crew 
further alvarez be hold -PRON- arm and say senor 
i know 
i understand but -PRON- shall settle 
-PRON- would not kill the pig with -PRON- own hand 
i didnot i finish jone 
hemmett pant as -PRON- vision clear a little and familiar object of the deck impress -PRON- on -PRON- brain once more 
no senor but -PRON- shall be do and well and what be -PRON- do here anyway 
hemmett break in 
i think -PRON- would go with girton 
-PRON- be by -PRON- order that i remain behind senor alvarez smile and hemmett wonder vaguely at the smile 
-PRON- be an unearthly sort of expresion pallid wideeye -PRON- suggest that alvarez be see vision 
and -PRON- senor hemmett will go i think to -PRON- assistance now 
eh 
i be not sure 
i think the senor girton call for help 
the wind be against -PRON- now but as -PRON- rise there be wild cry senor and much all right say mr hemmett get over there in a hurry then 
get -PRON- man together go senor and the alvarez smile grow more peculiar with every second 
and these dog and traitor even to the crew of el fuego -PRON- shall bind fast that -PRON- may remain 
and polito senor and the boy of the wireless -PRON- shall take -PRON- with -PRON- and three of the fireroom force as well for i know -PRON- and -PRON- be less traitor than fool 
edward hemmett stare after -PRON- as -PRON- flit away 
-PRON- have know alvarez for many year as a person of vivid enthusiasm and tremendous initiative once an idea have grip -PRON- yet -PRON- have never see alvarez carry on just like that before 
-PRON- be queer but meditate upon -PRON- be not nearly so pleasant as watch man truss up william jone and the unspeakable canita and the snarl member of el crew and hemmett turn -PRON- attention in that direction 
-PRON- be solid fact that -PRON- could not remember a single detail of the attack but -PRON- have certainly do a thorough job on william jone 
-PRON- remember that face and the boy have float before -PRON- just as -PRON- finger touch the corrupter of guanama and that be all 
and -PRON- have evidently be quite enough and to save -PRON- hemmett could feel no twinge of conscience 
-PRON- smile grimly and face alvarez just speed into sight again 
and now to go senor the young man cry 
-PRON- be to hasten i think and all be ready 
el tendqr will hold -PRON- easily 
-PRON- lead the way to the side and over -PRON- and hemmett follow briskly enough -PRON- mind turn to el fuego and what may be happen aboard -PRON- 
a human stream come after -PRON- fill the little boat and the pavoroso for a time be free to drift as -PRON- please 
ever and anon as -PRON- work over the engine alvarez glance back at -PRON- smile almost contentedly 
hemmett watch -PRON- and sigh once in a while -PRON- excitable guanaman go stark staring mad under too much emotional strain 
then -PRON- gaze wander to the scared wireless man to the fat young polito who smoke another cigarette and gaze philosophically and contentedly ahead 
polito by the way should have be leave in charge and -PRON- be here and safely 
alvarez announce 
and there be doubtless a genuine fight wait for -PRON- 
mr hemmett give over observation of -PRON- companion swing up to the deck and feel -PRON- swarm after -PRON- 
mr hemmett come face to face with -PRON- old friend stephen girton and three lady and one of -PRON- fly to mr arm with a scream of joy and for a little -PRON- cat nothing about the impending battle nor do -PRON- even note -PRON- absence until get the woman into the tender ne 
heaven know i sympathize but -PRON- two canot stand there and spoon all night 
this tub not go to float another ten minute 
-PRON- say senor alvarez gasp sink and that tender will have to take the woman over to the pavoroso first and then come back for the rest and great luck if some of -PRON- donot have to make the trip swimming 
alvarez wring -PRON- hand 
el fuego sink -PRON- shriek 
-PRON- sink 
then i have -PRON- say no more 
off where the pavoroso lie the ocean seem to open wide and belch forth flame and smoke 
a roar that shake the deck and seem fairly to beat -PRON- down come within the second and there be a queer loud hiss 
and the moon come at last from behind the cloud shine on the spot where the pavoroso have be 
there be only curiously turbulent water now with a great surge white pall of smoke overhead 
so shall all traitor die say alvarez between -PRON- tooth 
mr head be just settle back on -PRON- shoulder after the blast responsible for that -PRON- gasp 
with a timefuse senor i kindle the magazine before -PRON- leave the astonishing alvarez cry brokenly 
-PRON- be right 
-PRON- be just for such as -PRON- even this death be too merciful 
yet have i know yes have -PRON- know that -PRON- be likely to drown the whole crowd by do -PRON- -PRON- wouldnot have do -PRON- 
hemmett thunder -PRON- own sense return 
why -PRON- confound little lunatic -PRON- choke 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- too be go mad 
for here come polito stroll toward -PRON- cigarette and all and smile 
the vessel senor will not sink the officer report placidly 
the the seacock 
girton stutter 
yes 
-PRON- have be close of course by the lever which lie in the upper balcony of the engineroom polito smile 
otherwise i have also start the pump which run by the auxiliary power astern senor so that in an hour or so -PRON- shall float quite easily 
and by way of reach the shore since the fire be dead and the engine flood -PRON- shall use the auxiliary electric gear i think the storagebattery plant in the watertight compartment astern provide for the emergency of battle 
-PRON- be slow yet -PRON- shall effect a landing in parilla before two oclock i believe 
girton move limply to -PRON- side 
polito -PRON- manage with a queer shaky smile maybe -PRON- be -PRON- be some good after all -PRON- admit that edward hemmett even now have not readjust -PRON- 
-PRON- have bathe and shave and breakfast -PRON- have sleep three good hour after -PRON- return by rail from parilla and since cavalry have be around the house -PRON- have sleep soundly 
so that -PRON- be thoroughly rest and fit for business again but the calm of big senate chamber be almost disconcert after the thing that have happen last night 
and -PRON- be calm 
gaze down from the speaker desk at the hundred or more face mr hemmett reflect that never in all -PRON- history have this hysterical gathering of latin be so utterly calm 
here and there face be pale here and there face smile try to laugh give -PRON- up 
the air be downright thick with suspense and for cause 
so many thing have happen since this time yesterday that sort -PRON- out in any kind of sequence be downright impossible as yet 
alvarez the indefatigable the avenger have report -PRON- verbally as hemmett and girton breakfast alvarez have not sleep and show no sign of want to sleep for -PRON- country be to be save and the two american serve in the tremendous task that have descend upon -PRON- suddenly as any thunderbolt 
for one thing -PRON- appear that altara allege president of guanama have flee at dawn after an insane hour of bargaining with marado late secretary of state 
the upshot of the interview have be that marado agree dazedly that the recent president should not be pursue altara have leave a sign confession in -PRON- hand to be put to whatever use marado or any one else elect 
as a document -PRON- be a wonder 
hastily write even ungrammatical in spot -PRON- breathe one panicstricken desire to save -PRON- by expose all -PRON- accomplice nor do -PRON- lack in the definite quality for -PRON- give name and date and amount of bribe at such length that hemmett at least all but forget the substantial meal before -PRON- 
news travel fast in guanama 
an hour after daylight alvarez state there have be something very like a procession of laden motorcar make for the northern border 
puerto three morning paper be wallow helplessly in the trough of event without editor or visible owner five of the big gray army automobile have fight for the right of way on the first hill north of the city pack with uniform trunk and gesticulate man 
not less than eleven senator have resign and disappear and -PRON- be relate by alvarez that the cruiser almiranta have start out of the harbor have be halt by some saner soul aboard have transfer -PRON- cargo of guanaman to the huge yacht that have follow william jone to puerto carlo and -PRON- be go leave the navy short of officer as such and decidedly long of good one 
a thousand mile nearer the north pole the whole thing would have be grotesque and impossible in guanama -PRON- be only a little more than may have be expect for when panic and fear strike into guanaman circle -PRON- strike hard and spread more rapidly than any wildfire 
and now because the senate have no speaker and barton have collapse completely when -PRON- wife return because there have be a certain strong demand this morning in influential circle that -PRON- grip the situation instantly hemmett be sit up here and look at senate while stephen girton at -PRON- side assort document push this one forward and then that grunt and occasionally chuckle to -PRON- 
perhaps the most cheering document of all of -PRON- be the long official message from washington decode now and ready to be fire broadside into the choice little collection of legislator 
the clerk be call the roll in a small hush voice 
senator from the north the south the west and the east answer also in rather small hush voice although here and there a consciously righteous man speak vigorously in response to -PRON- name and even clear -PRON- throat impressively afterward 
the clerk turn toward mr hemmett and murmur there be nineteen more than -PRON- require for a quorum senor 
then well open the day business 
hemmett smile grimly as -PRON- arise 
gentleman 
absolute attention be -PRON- in one second 
the senate of guanama have no speaker this morning mr hemmett go on 
-PRON- be in the federal prison await trial on a charge of high treason 
-PRON- will be shoot 
i have take the chair because there be thing to be say which perhaps better than any one else be qualified to say 
have any member an objection to offer on parliamentary ground or any other ground

the first matter concern the recent election 
-PRON- have the confession of altara lately president that fraud govern these election from one end of guanama to the other 
do any one wish to dispute this statement 
gravelike silence brood over the senate chamber for a long minute 
then well assume that the election be fraudulent and if any one be contemplate dispute -PRON- later on i may say that up to the time i enter this chamber one hundred and nineteen election official have be arrest since daylight and with the help of the military -PRON- hope to gather in the whole seven hundred and something before night

will that stay put on a vote of this kind

a roar of assent arise a volatile obliging lot 
hemmett assure -PRON- of -PRON- havg just vote yourself out of office 
will -PRON- kindly rise and walk straight out of that door 
-PRON- predecessor be wait to resume -PRON- seat 
follow five minute of wild confusion 
the fiftyone have gaze at one another and doubtless review the know event of the last few hour move toward the door and through the entrance on the other side of senate chamber enter a long file of smile welldresse unduly important brown gentleman muster in by marado late secretary of state 
this gather together of depose senator have be the hysterical job and -PRON- have do -PRON- well 
nay -PRON- have do more for when the room begin to calm down a little -PRON- be at hemmett s side with a bundle of paper wave -PRON- hand and speak observe -PRON- dear senor hemmett

stephen girton agree as -PRON- gaze at the paper over shoulder 
-PRON- be in good legal form too ready for action now before somebody dynamite the senate chamber 
mr hemmett smile grimly 
ferrata 
come as soon as -PRON- have finish sign the official complaint demand by the federal prison that the multitude may be legally hold senor beam marado 
hemmett rise again 
silence come suddenly 
an act rasp mr hemmett 
an act to expel from the navy of guanama and from the army of guanama every officer and enlisted man who have serve less than two year and every other officer and enlisted man whatever -PRON- period of service who shall be unable to prove -PRON- absolute loyalty at all time past and present to guanama 
the clerk read -PRON- and -PRON- be sweeping and impressive 
-PRON- be indeed astonishingly impressive when one remember that -PRON- be composition and when -PRON- have be read a vote be take and the act become a law ready for signature 
and again mr hemmett have rise and bring down -PRON- gavel 
another act say -PRON- 
an act this time to declare the national engine work confiscate by the government of guanama for -PRON- own private purpose hereafter and forever and provide that the nominal incorporator of the say engine work shall receive as indemnity the official valuation -PRON- have put on the plant one million dollar unite state worth about thirty -PRON- add informally and there s no real reason for give up that one million but -PRON- look well 
the act be read 
the vote be take 
guanama have another new law 
another act continue the speaker pro tern 
an act grant immunity to any resident of guanama upon the furnishing of a permanent bond of ten thousand dollar who may confess voluntarily and in detail to -PRON- participation in the scheme by which guanama be to have be the naval base of a foreign power and further provide a penalty of life imprisonment for any such resident who may not have confess and who may be find within the boundary of guanama fortyeight hour after the signing of this act 
there be a hush after the reading of this act and much shift about 
several decidedly pallid face appear too yet the act become a law 
and still another one hemmett intone 
this act provide that to the last vessel guanama hereby sell to the united state of america every vessel of the guanaman navy as -PRON- stand today in every particular and at the price name in the record of the guanaman navy as the purchase price 
for example -PRON- down as have cost seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar as secondhand junk and that s what the united state pay for -PRON- 
the fact that -PRON- s worth about six million do not figure here at all somebody else loss but -PRON- isnot get in -PRON- vote on that mr clerk 
-PRON- come more slowly this time 
there be much waving of hand and much undertone discussion but the gavel come down thrice and hard in the thick of -PRON- and -PRON- look at mr hemmett and feel the power of a great republic behind -PRON- 
the guanaman navy as such cease to be a rather sweeping bill regard the character of man who shall be assign to duty at the coast fort and the general cleaning up of european man and thing in the army and political circle but that will have to be put into well shape before -PRON- take action on -PRON- continue the speaker pro tern 
so i think -PRON- can come to the most important piece of work of the morning gentleman 
-PRON- be this guanama be about to have a new and a new kind of treaty with the united state 
with the help of the american minister well have -PRON- draft and sign before night but the general import of -PRON- be this the government of guanama agree to deposit within one month the sum of one hundred million dollar with the government at washington 
yes i think that would start -PRON- yell smile the speaker as -PRON- hammer -PRON- gavel 
suitable interest will be pay and the money will be safe there than here 
should the government of guanama at any future time be find guilty of plot against the welfare of the united state this sum become immediately forfeit 
and further each of the coast fort will hold permanently one regiment of united state coast artillery supplement by whatever guanaman troop may be desire by the colonel of that regiment 
and still further thunder mr hemmett who be enjoy -PRON- hugely should the united state on proof of continue good behavior decide to resell at cost certain of the naval vessel -PRON- be agree that -PRON- shall be officer and partially man by american 
now holl yourself hoarse -PRON- conclude when the turmoil arise again and see what -PRON- make of -PRON- 
the odd thing be perhaps that when the tumult subside saner chasten mind be in the ascendency 
the term be ratified 
guanama have be spank 
and as forehead be be mop and smile man be talk to scowl man and hand be wave everywhere ferrata president restore hurry into the senate chamber and edward hemmett stretch 
-PRON- job do here ferrata -PRON- say simply 
take -PRON- chair 
a so the explosion in guanama come to an end and by evening most of the smoke have clear away 
people with too much on -PRON- mind have be leave town all day three steamer have clear quite unexpectedly for europe laden down train for the north and south have be pack too yet now quiet be upon puerto carlo and the resident be stroll down toward the plaza and the evening band concert just as usual talk a little more animatedly perhaps but otherwise move along quite as -PRON- have move these many year 
from the terrace of the hemmett home the owner and steve girton smoke and watch -PRON- silently 
-PRON- have reach the stage of weary relaxation where conversation be distasteful just now -PRON- listen thankfully to edward the younger from the upper floor smile suddenly and wave to carman and mercede as -PRON- appear at the window two young woman rather paler than usual and not so prolific in dimple yet two who be recover splendidly from a terrible experience 
the danger be over 
guanama ever ready for the psychological somersault have execute a series of -PRON- this later afternoon surround the house within five minute after -PRON- return cheer hail -PRON- as deliverer of guanama finally permit the marine band to force -PRON- way through the howl thousand and split the hot air with excited gusty discord to serenade -PRON- 
just as -PRON- have always be -PRON- be a lot of child to be lure this way by a white stick of candy and back again by a stripe one 
in -PRON- light moment -PRON- be amusing in -PRON- dark mood mr hemmett shake -PRON- head as -PRON- ponder and then rise to meet -PRON- fatherinlaw fernandez too be decidedly weary 
business man have be besiege -PRON- all day long some furiously propose a league of the righteous and blameless business element other beg hysterically that -PRON- aid -PRON- in clear away certain recent smudge on -PRON- reputation 
-PRON- be national hero again edward -PRON- smile 
-PRON- and stephen 
circumstance have a way of take the taste out of that job mr hemmett say rather sourly 
i know but -PRON- be wonderful nevertheless murmur fernandez 
-PRON- grip the whole thing so amazingly -PRON- thrust through law even before the senator could catch -PRON- breath and protest 
ah yes 
guanama may well be proud of -PRON- both 
mr girton smile 
consider the time -PRON- have live here and the money -PRON- have invest here and all the rest of -PRON- a darned sight rather be proud of guanama -PRON- remark 
true enough and doubtless some day -PRON- shall be sigh fernandez 
jone ay de mi -PRON- be not to be believe jone be dead and canita with -PRON- and -PRON- be say that of the corrupt fivesixth have already flee 
and so guanama be purge and purify 
and -PRON- two will become citizen as -PRON- have say 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand placidly 
edward hemmett look suddenly at stephen girton and discover that girton be eye -PRON- narrowly 
and as have happen many time before there be no need of word between -PRON- 
mr hemmett smile and shake -PRON- head 
well a great little country -PRON- say 
-PRON- owe a lot to guanama and -PRON- owe a lot to -PRON- and there be lot of thing about guanama that i like pretty well but i guess not 
but edward cry -PRON- fatherinlaw 
live here in business here with wife of guanaman blood -PRON- do not mean -PRON- pause before steady smile 
the speaker pro tern have lay a hand upon -PRON- knee 
i mean say -PRON- and the odd emotion of patriotism clog -PRON- voice a little that all right and everything else be all right 
but afraid that -PRON- steve and i well afraid that be just american after all first time bronson speak to -PRON- sheila decide that -PRON- be unlike any man -PRON- have ever know 
-PRON- have be about the office for several day a great broadshouldered fellow whose very voice be tune to the and as accustomed as -PRON- all be to man from the west john bronson be a man good to look upon as -PRON- go about -PRON- business 
there be some of the girl who laugh at -PRON- -PRON- be not the fashion of the figure that -PRON- worship in -PRON- favorite movie but not so with sheila 
-PRON- know in a moment that -PRON- be the type of man -PRON- ancestor have be redbloode individual who do not need gaudy necktie nor suede top to -PRON- shoe to make -PRON- woman love -PRON- 
-PRON- first conversation have take place while bronson be wait to get into mr room bronson as be the habit of the man who be practically visitor come wander into the office and stand look down at finger as -PRON- scarcely touch the key of -PRON- machine 
some different from the way -PRON- do thing in -PRON- country 
sheila do not answer -PRON- at once -PRON- finish the letter and then look up into -PRON- face ask -PRON- where -PRON- country be and if -PRON- didnot hate the city 
hate -PRON- 
-PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder 
no only people who live in the city hate the place 
folk like i be know -PRON- donot have to stay here -PRON- a lark to -PRON- 
only people that live in city hate -PRON- sheila be think aloud at the same time mechanically arrange -PRON- paper for the next letter 
yes i think -PRON- be right and live here forever and forever 
an insistent telephonebell call -PRON- then and bronson leave the room 
however when -PRON- see hamilton the head of the company that be dispose of -PRON- cattle for -PRON- -PRON- ask about the little blackeyed girl who have a desk in the room at the end of the hall 
who sheila 
why -PRON- s secretary 
philipse be head of the sale department and i guess -PRON- couldnot get on without sheila be here some time and to be truthful with -PRON- -PRON- rather interesting to -PRON- to watch those two 
i use to think that -PRON- be in love but i guess not for philipse have take a wife and sheila be still sheila 
why do -PRON- ask about -PRON- 
nothing 
come bronson confess be talk to -PRON- and think -PRON- s the quick bright little girl -PRON- have ever see 
i know an old man but i be still able to recognize one of little lady 
if i wasnot afraid by the color of -PRON- face that -PRON- would propose to -PRON- and disrupt -PRON- sale department send for -PRON- and give -PRON- a proper introduction 
i wish -PRON- would bronson speak before -PRON- realize -PRON- and hamilton laugh heartily 
i will just to prevent -PRON- from put -PRON- over -PRON- shoulder and walk off with -PRON- 
and remember bronson -PRON- s a product of civilization not a cavewoman from -PRON- native bad land 
hamilton press the button that summon -PRON- secretary and ask for miss -PRON- sit back in -PRON- chair and smile at effort to be unconcerned think the while that sheila would laugh at the cattleman 
miss this be mr bronson 
hamilton introduce -PRON- be ask about -PRON- and i havenot tell -PRON- much 
i be go to let -PRON- have first advantage and say -PRON- s a great big boy who s never be east of st loui before in -PRON- life get a cattle ranch and half a million dollar a good disposition and absolutely no knowledge of the polite way to talk to a lady 
oh come mr hamilton bronson break in admit to part of that speech but i do make objection to the end of -PRON- 
and so do sheila add 
-PRON- see -PRON- s speak to -PRON- already 
yes and -PRON- conscience prick -PRON- so that -PRON- demand this introduction 
poor bronson 
-PRON- hand twist the pencil -PRON- have pick from desk and -PRON- try to hide -PRON- discomfort by smile 
hamilton -PRON- keen sense for laughable situation photograph both expression be think what a splendid story -PRON- would make to tell at the club 
really -PRON- most rude of mr ham412 ilton to make fun of -PRON- and of -PRON- sheila say 
if -PRON- werenot that work here for such a very long time that i know mr hamilton like almost like a father be angry very glad to have meet -PRON- mr bronson and now get to run to finish mr work 
where be philipse mood have drop in an instant and the girl respond -PRON- go to the jersey yard to look over the new landing facility -PRON- write about and on the way back hell stop at the erie office spend the day investigate railroad condition cheap shipment mean cheap delivery 
hamilton nod 
-PRON- keep close tab on -PRON- donot -PRON- 
the girl reply with a quick nod a flush slowly creep up over -PRON- face as -PRON- turn and hurriedly leave the room 
bronson be busy the rest of the afternoon 
-PRON- have much to discuss with the man who represent -PRON- in the east and have full care of all -PRON- money transaction 
there be moment however when -PRON- think of the little darkeyed girl in the sale department and wonder if propriety allow -PRON- to ask -PRON- to spend the evening with -PRON- 
mr and mrs hamilton both of -PRON- twenty year -PRON- senior have try to show -PRON- the town but just once -PRON- would like to go to a restaurant with a young woman 
-PRON- do not dance at least not the dance that could be perform on the floor of the fashionable new york cafe but -PRON- want some one who would smile at -PRON- laugh with -PRON- and make a fitting picture for the frame of light and color that be call a room 
-PRON- be still question -PRON- courage when hamilton announce that -PRON- be go home 
come uptown with -PRON- -PRON- ask and bronson quickly find an imaginary excuse to wait 
other night -PRON- have be only too anxious to get away from the bewilder efficiency that be responsible for the firm success -PRON- want to linger and possibly speak again with sheila 
-PRON- be almost five oclock and everywhere there be preparation for the end of the day before -PRON- could summon enough courage to go into the office of the salesmanager 
-PRON- pass the door twice and finally enter 
sheila be there but not alone 
oh mr bronson come in this be mr philipse 
the two man shake hand each quickly appraise the other 
bronson see a slender man of some thirtytwo or three immaculately dress in rather flashy clothing 
-PRON- do not trust the brown eye that hold -PRON- own for a short time and then move away and there be only contempt for the little waxed mustache stranger in the city 
philipse ask 
i think i hear that -PRON- be to be here 
how do -PRON- like -PRON- 
not much bronson say quietly see a few nice thing since be here and plenty that i donot care for that true of every locality sure i should hate -PRON- native west 
bronson nod 
the highpitched voice with the carefully speak word would be laughable in the land -PRON- call home 
-PRON- could not help but think of the guying that this man would get if -PRON- should ever stumble upon a roundup 
i trust -PRON- will excuse -PRON- philipse keep on get to sign these letter in a hurry -PRON- car be wait for -PRON- 
go up town be glad to give -PRON- a lift 
no thank not quite finished for the night and bronson cross to the window out of the circle of light shed by desk lamp 
-PRON- hear philipse issue order in a peremptory tone and wonder how -PRON- be that -PRON- dare speak to such a girl as sheila in that manner 
pie shake -PRON- head and look out of the window down the canon of beaver street the light building loom with a grandeur that be almost equal to the canon -PRON- know 
-PRON- wait there till philipse have finish then watch -PRON- put on -PRON- overcoat and depart 
i donot think much of that fellow -PRON- tell sheila 
somehow i wouldnot trust -PRON- much more than i would a snake 
mr philipse be very very clever sheila say after a second one of the good salesman in the city 
salesman yes but if -PRON- would have say good man i should have doubt the worth of -PRON- city 
the girl laugh 
-PRON- be busy fold the letter -PRON- small thin finger move with a rapidity that fascinate the watcher 
-PRON- be very frank mr bronson most of -PRON- man who live be brutal about tell the truth 
why not 
-PRON- see nature be -PRON- real mistress -PRON- never lie 
i wonder if -PRON- would think i be too frank if i be to say that i like -PRON- a lot and want -PRON- to go out to dinner with -PRON- 
the girl send a quick look that go straight into eye 
for a minute -PRON- gaze be steady and then the girl let -PRON- eye rest on the mail -PRON- be fold 
i donot think i ought to go mr bronson 
-PRON- see only just meet -PRON- and i havenot any one i could ask as a chaperon 
do -PRON- really have chaperon outside of book 
bronson inquire with an amuse smile 
even if -PRON- do like just one dinner when there would be some one to talk with that be some one like to talk with afraid put -PRON- invitation in a jumble of word but i wish -PRON- would eat with -PRON- 
sheila laugh 
-PRON- speak as if -PRON- have be lonesome these past few day 
lonesome never think of -PRON- in that light but i guess that s the trouble be hang about with mr and mrs hamilton but -PRON- be old and -PRON- donot hate the city 
why lady i canot talk to -PRON- i canot seem to say what i want to but honest to goodness try to be a gentleman never yet have to be ashamed of the way i treat a woman 
sheila believe -PRON- 
-PRON- see the real trouble be that if i be to go with -PRON- some one may think -PRON- odd 
-PRON- mean -PRON- may think and say something wrong of -PRON- 
there be aggression as well as surprise in -PRON- tone 
yes just that 
and -PRON- would like to go if -PRON- wasnot for what may be say like to go very very much be very truthful with mr bronson and say that -PRON- invitation be very tempting and what s more go to accept 
fine 
-PRON- step forward -PRON- face alight with boyish enthusiasm 
yes go to let -PRON- call for -PRON- at seven oclock 
that will give -PRON- half an hour to get home and an hour to dress 
if -PRON- will have a taxi wear -PRON- party gown and -PRON- lovely silver slipper 
see just as enthusiastic as can be even if i have only know -PRON- a few hour 
five minute later -PRON- be give bronson the address refuse to let -PRON- send -PRON- home in a taxi 
while -PRON- have be put on -PRON- hat -PRON- wonder why -PRON- have accept the invitation but bronson be so much of a man and mr hamilton have truly introduce -PRON- that in spite of what -PRON- fear be -PRON- well judgment -PRON- do not tell -PRON- that -PRON- have change -PRON- mind 
-PRON- be exactly seven when the maid announce that mr bronson be call and should -PRON- let -PRON- wait in the parlor downstairs or should -PRON- bring -PRON- up to sittingroom 
bring -PRON- up nora go to let -PRON- see -PRON- green lampshade and the piece of rock that come off the blarney stone 
nora irish -PRON- be laugh as -PRON- show bronson the way and think all the while that -PRON- be a fine boy who be call on miss all ready sheila greet -PRON- from the doorway 
but just vain enough to ask -PRON- to come and see -PRON- room 
when i first come here to live i have a back room on the fourth floor but each time mr hamilton give -PRON- a raise i get a little near the front door and last year i get these two honesttogoodness room one flight up and i furnish -PRON- -PRON- such fun have -PRON- own sittingroom 
but bronson be not look at the room -PRON- eye be all for sheila 
for three day -PRON- have see -PRON- a trim little miss in clothe but -PRON- be no longer secretary to the salesmanager 
-PRON- be a sprite whose garment be blue and silver a silver cord in -PRON- hair and silver shoe and stocking on -PRON- foot eat -PRON- -PRON- laugh 
say good evening and if -PRON- look so hard at -PRON- dress think there s a hole in -PRON- 
i think that that -PRON- be about the most wonderful girl ever meet bronson say gravely 
hush or think -PRON- be irish and have kiss the blarney stone 
-PRON- uncle be there once -PRON- bring -PRON- back a chip -PRON- pick up and i kiss -PRON- most every day 
-PRON- leave -PRON- for a moment to get -PRON- coat and bronson look critically about the room 
-PRON- be not use to a woman room woman never have play a very great part in -PRON- life since -PRON- have be old enough to ride away from -PRON- father chbin 
now -PRON- look about -PRON- at the silken drapery at the wicker furniture and at the few picture that be on the wall 
i donot see how -PRON- can hate this place -PRON- say when sheila be with -PRON- again 
i donot see how -PRON- could ever wish to leave -PRON- pretty but to -PRON- -PRON- stand for so many disappointment so many day when i wish i be dead 
sometimes when i count the cost like to pile -PRON- all up and burn -PRON- 
bronson do not understand and say so a long long story mr bronson afraid -PRON- wouldnot interest -PRON- at all go very very hungry 
-PRON- be after midnight when bronson leave -PRON- and sheila decide that the evening have be a decide success 
-PRON- have dine at a noisy restaurant where the cabaret be famous have be to see -PRON- favorite musical comedy star and then have supper at the quiet and most fashionable hotel in the city this be choice 
still the girl be not happy for a spirit of discontent have fill -PRON- 
-PRON- be not that -PRON- long for a chance to live in the pleasurefille world that -PRON- have just see but -PRON- wish to run away from the life -PRON- know out to the broad existence that bronson picture 
-PRON- conversation have be largely personal 
with frank curiosity -PRON- have question each other as to -PRON- life 
sheila have tell about -PRON- parent -PRON- life at the convent and of go to work at seventeen story be not altogether different 
-PRON- have start on the low rung of the ladder and climb up hand over hand 
only the setting be different the story be about the same 
sheila do not see -PRON- in that light however -PRON- be think of the little annoyance that have fill -PRON- life and of the confinement 
-PRON- try to reason -PRON- out that any existence may become monotonous after a time -PRON- even try to think that every community may hold -PRON- philipse 
philipse face draw into a grim line when -PRON- think of philipse 
-PRON- know that -PRON- have be largely responsible for the luxury -PRON- now enjoy for as -PRON- secretary -PRON- receive thirtyfive dollar a week 
-PRON- try to tell -PRON- that philipse be only a business employer that everything else between -PRON- be over 
once -PRON- have believe that to be the case but tonight how could -PRON- deny the fact -PRON- know to be the truth 
with a sudden jump -PRON- spring onto -PRON- bed and snap out the light 
good night -PRON- say aloud a custom that have grow on -PRON- and intend to hide -PRON- loneliness from -PRON- another day and who can tell 
ten minute later -PRON- be asleep and not even -PRON- dream tell -PRON- that in -PRON- big hotel room bronson be smoke -PRON- goodnight cigar and wonder if miss sheila would be content in a ranch house till -PRON- could build a place fit for such a lady 
the more bronson see of john philipse the less -PRON- like -PRON- 
and the more -PRON- speak to sheila about philipse the more annoyed -PRON- become for -PRON- would say nothing about the man 
bronson however could see that sheila be not happy at -PRON- work 
-PRON- be train to know a sensitive horse or to guess the reason why cattle be restless 
-PRON- be this knowledge that tell -PRON- sheila be unhappy 
to -PRON- -PRON- seem a frightened animal like -PRON- big bay horse that always shy at the tompkin crossroad because of the bit of newspaper that have blow in -PRON- face the first time -PRON- drive -PRON- down that way 
-PRON- be wednesday afternoon when bronson and sheila first meet and as bronson explain -PRON- the follow afternoon -PRON- be go home on saturday and -PRON- didnot want to lose any time in talk 
-PRON- have to work during the day but -PRON- evening be free 
i know -PRON- sort of rush -PRON- but then that s what i want to do -PRON- confess 
please donot say that i canot see -PRON- tonight 
sheila after a minute think tell -PRON- that -PRON- may call on -PRON- 
bronson would have prefer another theater and supper party but sheila be firm 
-PRON- could call on -PRON- for an hour or so and -PRON- would ask miss goode the schoolteacher who live on the third floor to come in and make a welsh rabbit ask a few other people and have a party 
-PRON- see if -PRON- donot go anywhere but to theater and cabaret -PRON- will never know what -PRON- new yorker be like at home so just let -PRON- meet half a dozen real one the kind of people who only go to the theater once a month and then sit in the balcony 
bronson be willing anything as long as -PRON- mean -PRON- could be near sheila and -PRON- hurry through -PRON- solitary dinner and then wait a lonesome hour till -PRON- vas eight oclock 
-PRON- be the first of guest to arrive 
if -PRON- have be a sprite the night before -PRON- be miss simplicity this evening 
-PRON- dress be dark linen with collar and cuff of white and -PRON- hair be twist low on -PRON- neck give -PRON- the appearance of a country miss to whom the outsideworld be a legend 
now -PRON- look like -PRON- people bronson say in greet not let go of the hand -PRON- offer -PRON- 
now -PRON- look as -PRON- would if -PRON- come from the ranchhouse to meet -PRON- 
sheila start and draw away -PRON- hand 
i suppose i shouldnot have say that not what -PRON- may call really culture and i canot help be natural and say what i think 
and -PRON- think i belong in a ranchhouse 
yes in -PRON- but i suppose -PRON- will end up by live in a tenstory apartment with some fellow like philipse 
a flush creep over face

-PRON- be go to take sheila away with -PRON- if the very thought that come to -PRON- that minute be overpower 
-PRON- laugh aloud startling two or three people who be near -PRON- 
-PRON- almost run into the building -PRON- step reel as if be be intoxicate 
-PRON- be go to take sheila away with -PRON- 
not only tonight but forever 
what do -PRON- care for convention 
nature demand no chaperon and long engagement 
-PRON- be nature son why should -PRON- care for manmade law 
-PRON- reach the eighteenth floor and hurry down the long corridor 
the officedoor be open for a horde of clean woman have come out of nowhere and be busy make the room ready for the follow day 
-PRON- skirt a pile of wastepaper and step over a pail of hot water 
most of the office be dark but a bright light shone through the glass partition about philipse s sanctum 
the door be partly closed and as bronson start to push -PRON- open -PRON- hear -PRON- name mention and hesitate sorry -PRON- have to disappoint bronson but then i want to talk to -PRON- philipse be say 
then there wasnot a report after all voice be choke with anger

bronson shift uneasily wonder if -PRON- have well stay conceal or whether to break into the room and thrash philipse within an inch of -PRON- life 
-PRON- hear a quick movement and voice verge on tear 
please be man enough to stand aside and let -PRON- go

i love -PRON- once and -PRON- marry a woman who could give -PRON- polo pony and a racingcar stop love -PRON- forever 
but i never love -PRON- wife 
well at least -PRON- ought to be decent to -PRON- 
if -PRON- donot let -PRON- pass this minute tell mr hamilton the whole story in the morning and tell -PRON- wife right afterward 
and donot -PRON- suppose i could tell -PRON- story -PRON- suppose hamilton be wise to why i go to -PRON- three time in six month and have -PRON- salary raise 
-PRON- poor little fool even this man bronson know 
-PRON- say hamilton introduce -PRON- well bronson want a good time and hamilton know the girl to send for 
-PRON- know -PRON- lie 
the word be a low moan from heart and -PRON- reel as if strike 
philipse move forward to meet -PRON- but a hand on -PRON- shoulder send -PRON- sprawl to the floor movement have be as the whirlwind and -PRON- be -PRON- arm that close about sheila 
for a minute there be no sound 
philipse pick -PRON- up from the floor and -PRON- hand seek the back of a small chair 
sheila be sob noiselessly against coat 
well 
philipse ask after a minute 
-PRON- be a good talker and may brazen -PRON- out of this situation 
i donot give a damn if what -PRON- say a minute ago be true bronson say slowly 
i donot believe -PRON- 
-PRON- wouldnot make any difference if -PRON- be true but -PRON- about the last rough talk -PRON- will ever pull to any woman hand grip tight the back of the chair and swing -PRON- a few inch from the floor 
put -PRON- down 
bronson roar without move and philipse obey 
now -PRON- whitelivere snake go to tell -PRON- something and then probably thrash -PRON- soul to hell 
sheila shudder and lift -PRON- head arm be still about -PRON- and -PRON- make no effort to move from -PRON- embrace 
this party make -PRON- think of fifteen year ago when i be a kid and just start out to earn -PRON- way 
there be a bunch of cattleman in -PRON- neighborhood and the wolf be bother -PRON- calf and get an occasional twoyearold 
-PRON- be bad business and -PRON- offer -PRON- -PRON- first regular salary to kill all the pest 
the wolfer that s the name -PRON- give -PRON- in the neighborhood and the wolfer be what -PRON- -PRON- today 
and -PRON- know philipse in the last halfhour come to think that a wolfer be what be need right here in this city -PRON- folk be so proud of 
-PRON- need -PRON- for fellow like -PRON- 
out in -PRON- country -PRON- look on a wolf as about the low thing god make but if -PRON- would ever hear -PRON- tonight -PRON- would take off -PRON- hat in respect every time -PRON- see a wolftrack in the snow 
bronson move a quick step forward -PRON- hand clench 
philipse start and -PRON- hand seek the chairback 
with a lightninglike move bronson pull the chair from -PRON- grasp kill donot 
sheila cry and -PRON- tug at the arm that bronson be lift to strike 
-PRON- isnot worth killing 
bronson look from the cower whitelipped philipse to sheila 
i guess maybe -PRON- be right 
-PRON- would mess thing up and -PRON- have get to get away tomorrow 
philipse straighten perceptibly 
now -PRON- get and if i ever see -PRON- face again -PRON- will be just as if catch a wolf in a trap death and with one threaten shove -PRON- send philipse hatless and coatless into the darkened corridor of the office 
i donot know how i can thank -PRON- sheila whisper after a minute 
both for what -PRON- have do and what -PRON- say 
about not care whether what philipse say be true 
-PRON- nod 
once i think i love -PRON- 
yes i hear all that 
and about the money 
yes and mr introduction 
-PRON- lie about -PRON- as -PRON- lie about -PRON- 
now canot -PRON- shake and forget about -PRON- 
-PRON- offer -PRON- -PRON- hand 
-PRON- take the big hand that seem to hide -PRON- own in -PRON- palm glad -PRON- be a wolfer once -PRON- tell -PRON- smile through -PRON- tearstained eye 
and now go to ask -PRON- to please let -PRON- off from tonight party tired and like to be alone face mirror -PRON- disappointment 
if -PRON- would rather not go -PRON- say slowly and then but before -PRON- leave -PRON- i want to tell -PRON- something about a calf i pick up once after shoot two wolf that be get ready to enjoy a good meal 
the calf have a tear in -PRON- foreleg so i take -PRON- home with -PRON- halfcarrie -PRON- most of the way and the man the animal belong to think -PRON- be such a joke that -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON- for -PRON- own 
-PRON- be the first head of cattle i ever own the very first and old mrs calf be still live out there at sunrise and get a painting of -PRON- in the ranch hallway 
now -PRON- know -PRON- stop a minute when i come back here tonight -PRON- be to tell -PRON- that i want -PRON- to stop have to do thing for philipse 
to tell -PRON- in good allround a united state that i love -PRON- and want -PRON- to marry -PRON- tomorrow 
and -PRON- know when i beat off that wolf -PRON- make -PRON- think that that i be -PRON- pet calf tear be banish by -PRON- laughter 
bronson be crestfallen 
i wasnot think to insult -PRON- any only i canot tell a story the way -PRON- ought to be 
i shouldnot have laugh the trouble with -PRON- that be irish -PRON- laugh most of the time and sometimes at the wrong time 
but i guess -PRON- be laugh at something funny then -PRON- must be funny to hear -PRON- tell -PRON- that i love -PRON- 
funny 
do -PRON- suppose old mrs calf think -PRON- be funny when -PRON- half drag -PRON- home after kill the wolf -PRON- remember that song -PRON- hear the other night when the right man come along 
sheila lift -PRON- face to -PRON- eye glow with light 
-PRON- mean -PRON- ask wonderingly 
i mean wolfer that well go to dinner and then have to pack if be go away tomorrow night 
a and fortysecond street an hour and a half by train two separate world in ideal and tradition 
the motto of west point be honor valor country 
fortysecond street have many slogan but none of -PRON- be just like that 
neither be early to bed and early to rise 
at west point reveille have long since sound and the work of the day be on at full swing before fortysecond street have awaken to much more show of life than the rumbling of the morning milkcart 
as to be healthy wealthy and wise well maybe west point score on the first count but when -PRON- some to gather in the mazuma or prove up as wise guy where have the soldier boy get even a lookin 
to tell the truth -PRON- rate in the eye of fortysecond street as little well than a bunch of comeon 
take for instance the case of cadet kerr mosely and miss queenie sinclair 
this kerr mosely mind -PRON- too be rate as some pumpkin in the corps 
-PRON- be halfback on the football team close up to the top of the list in class stand a soldier every inch of -PRON- and the leader in every mischievous prank or bit of deviltry that be go a stalwart redheade young giant who could outride outbox outshoot and outflirt any other man at the academy the idol of -PRON- fellow and a terror to the tacs 
and queenie sinclair be just a hasbeen of a chorus girl some people say that -PRON- have be in the first production of erminie at the casino way back in eighteen hundred and frozetodeath but that may have be slander -PRON- look like a cross between a colored comic supplement and the ruin of blarney castle 
but at that -PRON- put -PRON- over this mosely silas seven way from sunday 
fortysecond street for -PRON- also the female of the specie 
not of course that the scheme be of contrive 
like most dear old grandmother of today -PRON- be brilliant enough of hair and complexion too brilliant to be true but even good friend could never have rate the glimmer of -PRON- mental attainment at more than half a kilowatt 
no -PRON- be tommy wilburt who dope out the great idea tommy wilburt a former pressagent but now one of those lily of broadway tiger lily that toil not neither do -PRON- spin yet in some mysterious manner manage to exist 
-PRON- inventive genius spur by certain trenchant remark on the part of -PRON- landlady and the knowledge that -PRON- bankroll have dwindle to one lone fish fold away in the corner of -PRON- waistcoatpocket have work out the project during the watch of a more or less sleepless night and as -PRON- start out the next morning for breakfast -PRON- feel that all -PRON- need be a suitable instrument 
strange be the way of destiny 
if mr wilburt have possess even so much as a dollar and a quarter -PRON- would probably have chance eat at one of the sumptuous place on main street but that single lone bone drive -PRON- to economy and to the sixth avenue bakery where queenie sinclair be fortify -PRON- with roll and coffee for -PRON- weary daily round of the manager office 
queenie be very much at liberty which be the polite theatrical term for out of a job 
even the burlesque show and the tabloid musical comedy of vaudeville must draw the age limit somewhere and as one outspoken producer have tell -PRON- only the day before broiler be use in this show queenie not soup stock 
in short -PRON- be in a desperate and bitter mood ripe for almost any proposal from manslaughter down and mr wilburt as -PRON- eye encounter -PRON- along the line of marbletoppe table and note the defiant tilt to -PRON- hat instinctively recognize the fact 
-PRON- saunter over and seat -PRON- across from -PRON- 
hello kid 
-PRON- affect a tone of glad surprise 
how re -PRON- come 
queenie draw -PRON- up haughtily prepared to resent the advance of a mere beanery patron but rather puffy face and protuberant light eye stir a chord of memory 
why if -PRON- ainot mr wilburt 
-PRON- melt 
i ainot see -PRON- since that summer opera snap what mannheimer take out 
yes and -PRON- get a raw deal that time if any one ever do tommy protest eagerly 
i tell mannheimer -PRON- be make the mistake of -PRON- life when -PRON- can -PRON- to put that swede chambermaid in for leader of the march and canned 
miss sinclair interrupt shrilly 
never think that no stiff the size of mannheimer ever do nothing like that to -PRON- 
i get a well offer to join out with the girl from dayton company and i quit -PRON- 
mr wilburt realize -PRON- mistake and hasten to retrieve -PRON- 
just another lie of eh -PRON- nod 
well donot -PRON- care kid 
a knock from -PRON- be always a boost a and anyhow -PRON- all ancient history now 
by the way what be -PRON- do these day queenie 
-PRON- 
-PRON- tone of careless ease be only too obviously a pretense 
oh rest a week or two 
the picture be after -PRON- hard but i canot just see -PRON- 
-PRON- say -PRON- studio light be something fierce on the eye 
then there s a girl show that i be offer a swell part in and but wilburt be in no humor to listen to a long list of mythical prospective engagement 
say look here kid -PRON- cut in get a part that i believe -PRON- can play 
-PRON- ainot strictly professional -PRON- glance at -PRON- narrowly across the platter of ham and egg which have just be set before -PRON- but there s a bunch of coin to be make if -PRON- handle right 
the significance of that look and of -PRON- tone be not lose upon -PRON- 
-PRON- hesitate a moment then -PRON- twitch -PRON- shoulder with a reckless movement and give an unsteady laugh 
a bunch of coin what be all after ainot -PRON- 
go ahead and shoot mr man -PRON- layout 
for answer tommy extract a newspaper clipping from -PRON- pocketbook and hand -PRON- across to -PRON- 
-PRON- be the story of a west point cadet who have be expel from the academy for marry what give -PRON- the suggestion explain mr wilburt after -PRON- have read the story 
but queenie only look puzzled 
i donot get -PRON- idea at all 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
where be there any money in get the roller put under a cadet 
be -PRON- wise to another stunt of the kind and want -PRON- to tip -PRON- off 
be that -PRON- 
no no 
wilburt shrug impatiently 
on the contrary i want to pull off a wedding which shall be a dead secret 
and -PRON- queenie i have cast to be the bride 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- a moment then with the suspicion that -PRON- be merely hoax -PRON- an angry red overswept the rouge upon -PRON- cheek and -PRON- eye take on a vicious glitter 
try to kid -PRON- be -PRON- 
-PRON- voice tremble 
why -PRON- miserable rat and -PRON- reach for -PRON- cup of coffee if i wasnot too much of a lady dash this in -PRON- ugly grinning mug -PRON- hold on 
tommy protest hastily not josh -PRON- 
this be on the level sinclair 
i really do want -PRON- to hook up with one of these guy in a secret marriage 
i there s money in the proposition 
money -PRON- scoff 
why -PRON- cadet only have fifty cent a week spending money 
i know cause i board in a family once what have a boy at west point 
and marry one of -PRON- 
no thank -PRON- i ainot look for no child to raise just at present 
besides -PRON- stop abruptly as if check -PRON- in something -PRON- have be about to say 
besides -PRON- go on a trifle lamely what s that old say about catch -PRON- rabbit before -PRON- cook -PRON- 
where be i go to get -PRON- cadet 
-PRON- pick up the morning paper which lie beside -PRON- plate and fold -PRON- over so as to disclose the headline deal with the armynavy football game schedule for that day pass -PRON- across to -PRON- 
where will -PRON- get a cadet -PRON- repeat 
why the town will be full of -PRON- tonight and as the chance be about six to one that the army be go to win -PRON- will all probably be in high good humor 
if -PRON- do as i tell -PRON- old girl -PRON- can land any of -PRON- 
but there s one in particular that out after 
-PRON- consider a moment then take back -PRON- paper make a checkmark with -PRON- pencil opposite one of the name in the lineup of the army team 
kerr mosely -PRON- question as -PRON- read the name -PRON- have indicate 
wilburt nod 
what -PRON- get against -PRON- 
nothing tommy laugh except that -PRON- s the only son of old george mosely united state senator from california and generally know as the rockefeller of the pacific coast 
now do -PRON- begin to get a line on the working of the plot little one 
-PRON- mean that if i marry this cutie the old man will pay to get rid of -PRON- 
yes to get rid of -PRON- and avoid all the scandal and publicity that would come from have -PRON- son fire come across for a million 
and -PRON- canot do anything to -PRON- for -PRON- -PRON- demand warily 
arrest -PRON- for kidnaping or anything like that 
not a chance 
tommy brush the suggestion aside with a wave of the hand 
this boy of full age twentythree year old 
-PRON- can tie -PRON- up to mr wilburt search -PRON- imagination for something to stand as a totally impossible bride but nothing occur to -PRON- as bad than miss sinclair -PRON- end by simply say -PRON- 
-PRON- can tie -PRON- up to -PRON- and nobodys get a right to question -PRON- 
besides -PRON- one effort will be to keep the thing quiet 
queenie stir -PRON- coffee thoughtfully 
give -PRON- the sketch -PRON- say 
how do -PRON- land -PRON- 
easy as fish for friday 
catch -PRON- on the old chivalry gag protest a woman honor and all that sort of thing 
-PRON- make up for an ingenue part understand curl and ruffle and giggle of sweet sixteen 
-PRON- can do -PRON- all right 
i remember a bit -PRON- have with the mannheimer show that be just the type i want 
only for sake tone down that makeup of yours 
this doll be suppose to be a shy clinging homebody not a belle of the manicure parlor 
-PRON- leave that to -PRON- miss sinclair interrupt impatiently 
get down to the action 
what happen 
well -PRON- like this at a dance place with -PRON- cousin i can get some chorus man with a dresssuit to do that part of -PRON- for ten or fifteen dollar and -PRON- be just as excited as can be over the novel experience of be out at such a place at night 
then i come along with mosely and stop to speak to cousin 
-PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- and insist that -PRON- sit down at -PRON- table 
then -PRON- know this mosely already break in queenie 
know -PRON- 
no 
but make -PRON- acquaintance today never fear and manage to steer -PRON- to that dancejoint too -PRON- worry about -PRON- part of -PRON- just pay attention to what i tell -PRON- and figure on what -PRON- have get to do -PRON- see where be i at 
oh yes 
cousin introduce -PRON- and -PRON- sit down at -PRON- table 
then after a few minute cousin excuse -PRON- and fade say hell be back shortly 
-PRON- and mosely have a dance or two 
-PRON- play up to -PRON- but not too strong understand just the sort of fluttering interest that a girl of sixteen would show toward brass button and for the love of mike say as little as possible a regular anna hold with those eye of your queenie but -PRON- know well enough conversation ainot -PRON- long suit now the real work of the piece commence 
cousin doesnot come back 
-PRON- begin to get worried and uneasy ask what time -PRON- be and when -PRON- find -PRON- be after midnight look scared and wonder what papa will say 
i volunteer to go hunt cousin up and come back look grave 
i draw mosely aside and whisper that cousin have get a bun on and have go off with a crowd of rahrah boy 
the rotten souse i say -PRON- s apt never to think of this little girl again get to get a taxi and take -PRON- home 
so into a taxi the three of -PRON- pile and speed -PRON- up to old house on ninetyfourth street 
dilsey come to the door -PRON- in dressinggown and slipper play the heavy parent there -PRON- snarl -PRON- papa -PRON- say 
these gentleman bring -PRON- home 
then -PRON- try to slip by -PRON- but -PRON- bar the way and put up a roar that a make the father curse in hazel kirke sound like qod bless -PRON- 
-PRON- plead with -PRON- and -PRON- argue but -PRON- may as well talk to a stone 
never shall -PRON- cross that threshold again -PRON- declare until -PRON- can do so with a marriage certificate in -PRON- hand 
then -PRON- go inside and slam the door in -PRON- face 
what be -PRON- to d bawling and cry tell -PRON- there s no place for -PRON- but the river and so i put -PRON- squarely up to mosely that the only honorable thing for -PRON- be to marry -PRON- 
a divorce can easily be arrange later i tell -PRON- but in order to protect this poor child good name and save -PRON- from a suicide grave somebody must go through at least the form of a wedding with -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- i say but unfortunately i already have a wife so -PRON- look as if -PRON- be elect 
and -PRON- expect -PRON- to fall for a game of bunk like that query the chorus girl scornfully 
-PRON- dear -PRON- be -PRON- business to peddle bunk around this town for many year and i never yet fall down on anything i really want to put across see old and wise man than this cadet fall for stuff that be fifty time raw than this be 
no sister the one gift i have be a persuasive tongue and if -PRON- will only play up to -PRON- end of -PRON- willing to guarantee that i can coax -PRON- in front of a justice of the peace over in hoboken and that -PRON- will be mrs kerr mosely by this time tomorrow 
again queenie musingly stir -PRON- coffee 
how much real money can -PRON- hold the old man up for -PRON- question 
i donot want to hear about million but what hell actually give up 
well -PRON- ought to get fifty thousand dollar at the very least aver mr wilburt 
and how be -PRON- plan to cut -PRON- -PRON- bargain 
four way 
equal share to -PRON- and -PRON- and dilsey and a fourth share to the lawyer that well need to conduct the negotiation and collect the money for -PRON- 
miss sinclair drain the last of -PRON- coffee and set down the empty cup with an air of decision 
twelve thousand five hundred for -PRON- eh -PRON- calculate 
all right tommy 
bring on -PRON- cadet 
tommy wilburt have predict west point win the armynavy football game that day and consequently when the victorious team return home the follow afternoon the reservation rang with shout of exultation and long after tap be sound the barrack still continue to celebrate -PRON- triumph the authority for once wink at the breach of regulation 
but the one man whose name be on everybodys tongue and who more than any other have help accomplish defeat take but little part in the general jubilation get the goat sing out a cheer leader as the hero of the occasion appear in the quadrangle 
and the admire corps crowd around in congratulation chorus back mosely 
mosely 
spell -PRON- out shriek the cheerleader and five hundred lusty throat chant in a great volume of sound -PRON- would have carry -PRON- on -PRON- shoulder in -PRON- exuberance but -PRON- shrink back from the ovation and instead of seem gratify act as if -PRON- want to run away 
as soon as may be indeed -PRON- do make -PRON- escape and slip off to -PRON- quarter where none could intrude save -PRON- faithful roommate darwin remain there in gloomy seclusion 
hang if i know what s get into -PRON- 
darwin report to a group of in424 quiring comrade later in the evening think to see -PRON- that -PRON- would chuck the game for the team instead of win -PRON- practically singlehande 
-PRON- just stand there stare out of the window with nothing more to say than a particularly reticent clam 
if -PRON- wasnot so allfire fit think -PRON- be start in on a sickness 
why just to show -PRON- how -PRON- s behave darwin go on -PRON- get a telegram from -PRON- dad tonight 
just the one word congratulation -PRON- be but the way -PRON- look -PRON- would have think -PRON- be a death warrant 
-PRON- go white when -PRON- read -PRON- and i believe for a minute -PRON- be go to faint 
then -PRON- sort of catch -PRON- together 
oh -PRON- the game -PRON- mean -PRON- mutter 
yet what else could -PRON- have suppose the old man be wire -PRON- congratulation about 
pshaw probably only the effect of come off training suggest one of the other consolingly see fellow go queer before because of that and kerr have be stick to -PRON- pretty close -PRON- know 
give -PRON- a day or two and hell come around all right 
but a day or two pass and a month or two pass and still cadet mosely maintain that glum and repellent attitude toward -PRON- world 
from be perhaps the most frankly sociable and genial chap in the whole corps -PRON- degenerate into a recluse and a grouch 
-PRON- act to -PRON- like a sort of eugene aram say one keenwitte chap in discuss the change one of those guy -PRON- know that s get a guilty secret on -PRON- mind 
half the time -PRON- go moon along without notice anybody or anything and then if -PRON- happen to speak to -PRON- suddenly or unexpectedly hell almost jump out of -PRON- skin 
there be the more opportunity to observe and speculate upon the former favorite alter demeanor because there be little else to occupy the attention of the cadet in -PRON- hour of leisure 
-PRON- be a bitterly cold winter that year start in just after the armynavy game in the west point calendar everything date from that and last unbroken until now late in february the river still lie sheathe in ice the snow be pile deep across the plain the bite wind of the highland whoop and whistle around corner and through sallyport and the gothic building show along the spouting and eave grotesque gargoyle and projection which the architect never plan 
visitor to the post be few and the ordinary entertainment of the season in consequence languish 
-PRON- be a dull depressing period during which both the cadet and the officer in charge of -PRON- chafe under the monotony of -PRON- routine 
various reckless outbreak and escapade on the part of the corp be a natural result of these condition and proportionately there be a steady increase to the rank of the area bird those offender against military discipline who for -PRON- sin be compel during recreation hour to pace the quadrangular courtyard of barrack chin up gun a shoulder and at a quickstep 
ordinarily kerr could hardly have escape this dragnet and with the other would have be trudge a fivehour stretch in the bleak quadrangle on wednesday and saturday afternoon but this year -PRON- be too absorb and indifferent to join in any of the lawlessness 
not so though -PRON- roommate 
darwin be mix up in nearly everything go and although for a time -PRON- manage to evade the vigilance of the tac be finally gather in and give a sentence a circumstance which strange as -PRON- may seem be materially to affect the ambitious plan of mr tommy wilburt and miss queenie sinclair 
widely separate world west point asid fortysecond street may be but just as a stone cast into a lake will cause an everwidene ripple that spread until -PRON- reach the farther shore the little incident up the hudson be not to be unfelt in the land of the bright light 
a so far the project of the two schemer for annex a wad of the eld wealth have be progress as smoothly and expeditiously as even -PRON- could have desire 
the lawyer -PRON- have retain an artist at blackmail within the form of the statute have already open negotiation with father and the latter have come to west point and satisfy -PRON- by a rather painful interview with -PRON- son that the marriage have actually occur be now bargain with the plotter to have the union dissolve and the whole distasteful business definitely close up a plain holdup -PRON- growl to -PRON- attorney 
kerr have never see the woman before -PRON- be introduce to -PRON- a the dancehall -PRON- leave -PRON- at the altar 
-PRON- inveigle -PRON- into the ceremony solely through -PRON- foolish sense of chivalry 
yet what can -PRON- do 
-PRON- know that publicity in the matter would ruin -PRON- boy career 
-PRON- must simply settle with the woman as cheaply as -PRON- can and then get -PRON- off to reno or some place where this farcical marriage knot can be quietly untie 
the lawyer be an adept at extricate the son of -PRON- wealthy client from the scrap into which -PRON- manage to get 
this be not the first time -PRON- have deal with chorusgirl bride by suggest financial balm as a salve for -PRON- broken heart 
but -PRON- have to confess that miss queenie sinclair coach as -PRON- be by tommy wilburt and the shady legal adviser be just about the tough proposition -PRON- have ever encounter 
-PRON- be last chance to play the role of a trusting and desert damsel and recognize the fact -PRON- be determined to make the most of -PRON- 
the lawyer have finally to report to senator mosely that an even be the very low settlement that -PRON- could effect 
the senator knit -PRON- brow a moment then -PRON- write out a check for the amount and push -PRON- across the table to the lawyer 
some price for chivalry eh 
but i canot afford to haggle any longer 
tell -PRON- -PRON- make a wry face that the money be her as soon as the court have do -PRON- work 
but the bestlaid plan of millionaire and also of blackmailer sometimes gang agley 
papa rosy belief that -PRON- have dispose of the affair by sign that check and likewise the dream of easy affluence in which the sinclairwilburt combination be indulge be both due for a jolt 
-PRON- fall about in this wise 
kerr hurry back to -PRON- quarter one snowy afternoon be halt by one of the disciplinary officer a lieutenant name crosby who have be -PRON- cadet captain when mosely be a plebe and against whom the latter consequently cherish an undying hatred 
crosby be exult over the fact that -PRON- have finally succeed in land the luckless darwin among the area bird and -PRON- could not resist the temptation to rub -PRON- in on close associate 
ah mr mosely -PRON- say with a malicious grin 
i just see -PRON- wife over at headquarter have an interview with the colonel 
i expect -PRON- will be want next 
if ever there be a case of a guilty conscience prove a man undo -PRON- be then 
kerr give a start which almost split -PRON- tightly button fatigueblouse up the back and turn as many color as a chameleon on a piece of plaid 
-PRON- wife -PRON- gasp in consternation 
be that woman actually here at the post 
the next moment -PRON- could have cheerfully bite -PRON- tongue out for -PRON- realize from stare of utter amazement that the other in speak of -PRON- wife have only be use the west point slang term for roommate 
-PRON- be too late now though to recall or amend the fatal admission 
the astonishment in fishy eye have al426 ready change to a gleam of malevolent satisfaction 
so 
the lieutenant significantly draw -PRON- notebook from -PRON- pocket and pencil an entry 
i wasnot far wrong be when i say the colonel would likely be want to see -PRON- too 
in fact i guess -PRON- would better come right along with -PRON- and have -PRON- talk with -PRON- now 
there be no help for -PRON- 
over to headquarters kerr be march and usher into the presence of that grim autocrat the superintendent 
from -PRON- note lieutenant crosby read a verbatim transcript of the conversation which have just occur between mosely and -PRON- lay especial stress upon the cadet confuse and stammer response to the statement regard darwin 
as -PRON- catch the implication contain in unfortunate slip of the tongue the colonel draw -PRON- up sharply 
then -PRON- lean forward across -PRON- desk -PRON- face set and severe 
cadet mosely and -PRON- stern eye pierce the culprit through do -PRON- realize that this remark of -PRON- must be interpret as a confession a confession which unless explain will necessitate the lodging of charge against -PRON- -PRON- court martial and -PRON- almost certain expulsion from the academy 
i do sir 
have -PRON- any explanation then which -PRON- wish to offer 
kerr gulp once or twice -PRON- find -PRON- hard to speak 
none sir -PRON- finally manage to answer 
the colonel frown deepen -PRON- voice take on an add tinge of hardness 
cadet mosely i ask -PRON- the direct question 
be -PRON- a married man 
the legal procedure at west point have a crude primitiveness which would turn the ordinary hairsplitte barrister of the court green with wonder 
no objection be permit there on the score of incriminate one self 
-PRON- ask a straightout question and -PRON- expect a straightout answer 
moreover -PRON- get -PRON- 
-PRON- have an institution call the honor of the corps perhaps the most cherished tradition of the place which prescribe that every cadet must reply truthfully when interrogate concern -PRON- personal action or behavior no matter how disastrous the result may be to -PRON- 
queenie sinclair and tommy wilburt have never hear of the honor of the corps and evenif -PRON- have -PRON- would never have believe -PRON- 
from the viewpoint of fortysecond street -PRON- would have say there ainot no such animal 
but kerr be only too well aware of -PRON- existence and -PRON- never once think of disobey or evade that unwritten obligation 
there be but one recourse leave to -PRON- a slight one but -PRON- decide to take advantage of -PRON- chiefly because the lump which keep rise in -PRON- throat at the thought of all this be go to mean to -PRON- make speak increasingly difficult 
if -PRON- please sir -PRON- say i should like to reply to that in writing 
as -PRON- wish 
the colonel nod -PRON- assent 
but as -PRON- turn back to -PRON- paper kerr from -PRON- manner be miserably conscious that the superintendent already regard -PRON- as an outcast and pariah return cold and weary after -PRON- five hour stretch of duty in the area enter the quarter jointly occupy by -PRON- and mosely to find kerr seat before the writingtable in a brown study 
so absorbed be -PRON- in -PRON- somber reflection that -PRON- do not even glance up but darwin have by this time grow accustomed to these fit of reverie on the part of -PRON- formerly lively comrade and pay no heed 
a -PRON- shiver as -PRON- hang over the radiator tenderly massage -PRON- red and frostbitten nose 
talk about the hardship of scott and peary get to the pole 
-PRON- didnot have anything on -PRON- bet get icicle on -PRON- lung 
-PRON- stand there scowl out of the window across the snowheape plain 
by george do -PRON- go on 
anybody that want to flatten -PRON- foot and freeze -PRON- spine in that confound quadrangle can do -PRON- as for -PRON- quoth the raven nevermore 
mosely rouse from -PRON- abstraction and stand up 
there be a trace of bitterness in -PRON- faint quizzical smile 
-PRON- think -PRON- be play in pretty tough luck donot -PRON- 
why monk -PRON- go without say that this be the nickname in which darwin rejoice give anything on earth just to be in -PRON- shoe 
this and -PRON- pick up a seal envelope from the table be -PRON- walking paper 
the other stare at -PRON- incredulously 
not until -PRON- have step quickly over to the table and see for -PRON- the superintendent name on the envelope do -PRON- begin to believe 
-PRON- resignation -PRON- gasp 
well practically that a statement to the supe which be bind to break -PRON- 
why make -PRON- then expostulate darwin 
-PRON- ask -PRON- the direct question 
i tell -PRON- i would give -PRON- answer in writing 
this be -PRON- 
oh 
darwin gloomily nod -PRON- comprehension 
-PRON- too be familiar with the obligation impose by the honor of the corps 
then a suggestion come to -PRON- 
but look here kerr -PRON- will never put the skid under -PRON- 
why man alive -PRON- wouldnot be common gratitude after -PRON- showing in the navy game 
every officer in the service from the chief of staff down would let out a roar 
-PRON- may as well talk about fire the victory monument 
but mosely disconsolately shake -PRON- head 
football isnot go to save -PRON- here monk 
no nor anything else marry 
a bombshell could hardly have create great surprise and consternation 
darwin slump weakly into a chair roundeye -PRON- mouth opening and shut like a fishs without utter a sound 
so that s what s be the matter with -PRON- -PRON- manage finally to articulate 
oh kerr kerr why couldnot -PRON- have wait just a few month until commencement and then -PRON- wouldnot have make any difference 
wait 
-PRON- donot imagine i do this thing deliberately do -PRON- 
i be frame donot -PRON- understand 
-PRON- catch -PRON- with -PRON- guard down and rush -PRON- to the rope before i realize what be happen 
oh i know -PRON- hard to believe as darwin cock a skeptical eye at -PRON- 
but -PRON- true nevertheless and what s more -PRON- or any other file would have fall for -PRON- game just as hard as i do 
then -PRON- go ahead to tell how in the flush of -PRON- day of triumph -PRON- have be entrap by the sophisticated wile of miss sinclair and mr wilburt 
all -PRON- want be money -PRON- explain and the ink be hardly dry on the marriage certificate before -PRON- have a crook lawyer write to -PRON- father to demand a settlement 
-PRON- come right up here to see about -PRON- 
as -PRON- may imagine -PRON- wasnot a very joyful occasion 
but the old boy agree to see -PRON- through on -PRON- 
and then -PRON- groan and sink -PRON- head between -PRON- hand just when everything be arrange when the term have be settle and the marriage be to be annul and i begin to see -PRON- clear of the whole rotten mess just then this sneak quill of a crosby have to come along gloat over -PRON- on -PRON- account and i stub -PRON- toe nothing to be do now -PRON- finish 
the supe have put -PRON- up to -PRON- in so many word be -PRON- married and although write -PRON- the circumstance just as tell -PRON- to -PRON- i canot get away from the fact 
i canot get away from -PRON- and neither can -PRON- bound to expel -PRON- -PRON- canot even give -PRON- the opportunity to resign 
the only drop of satisfaction i can get now be that the bunch of flimflammer will get leave at the same time 
i be telegraph the old man to call off the deal -PRON- make with -PRON- 
-PRON- try to speak nonchalantly but in spite of -PRON- -PRON- voice choke and -PRON- turn quickly away to hide the quivering of -PRON- lip 
darwin who have be listen almost in stupefaction suddenly straighten up 
hold on there -PRON- cry eagerly stretch out -PRON- hand 
maybe there s a way out of the muddle after all get an idea 
no listen to -PRON- as kerr give an impatient hunch to -PRON- shoulder 
this be something that look as if -PRON- may work 
now tell -PRON- first -PRON- go on do -PRON- take a slant at that notice on the bulletin board this afternoon 
-PRON- mean the one about call off all the classwork for tomorrow on account of distinguished visitor 
prince chu yang of china and party come up to give -PRON- the onceover 
be that the one -PRON- mean the baby darwin nod 
prince chu yang of china what 
i have in mind when i tell -PRON- i be do with this infernal areatramping 
if -PRON- can only dope out the proper formation with -PRON- kerr all -PRON- trouble would be over that be -PRON- would for certain and i be almost sure yours would too 
-PRON- would eh 
kerr exhibit scant enthusiasm 
well maybe so but -PRON- have get to show -PRON- 
all i ever know to come from visitor of that sort be about a dozen extra drill 
look how -PRON- trot -PRON- around the parade ground for that greasy central american president last month and when the duke dorville be here not talk about any rattrap president or four flush duke or count interrupted monk 
what -PRON- have to have for this play of mine be genuine royal blood a prince or a king 
when one of that sort put up a request to the supe no matter what -PRON- be -PRON- s get to grant -PRON- as a compliment to the nation the guy represent donot -PRON- understand 
at any rate that s what be pull off when prince louis of battenberg be here about ten or twelve year ago 
the gang get next to -PRON- somehow and louis be a good scout in -PRON- way up and ask that all punishment be remit 
and the supe stand for -PRON- 
without a whimper 
-PRON- have to donot -PRON- see or maybe provoke what -PRON- call an international incident 
or at least that s the way joe phelp put -PRON- to -PRON- and -PRON- get the story from -PRON- cousin who be here at the time 
mosely begin to show a more lively interest 
and now -PRON- have get -PRON- in -PRON- head to tear off the same stunt eh 
sure provide of course that this prince or whatever -PRON- call -PRON- be really royalty 
nothing short of actual royal blood will serve -PRON- hive -PRON- and be bother more or less to know whether a chink would turn the trick 
prince sound all right of course but -PRON- canot always tell about these ringtaile title 
in russia as i understand -PRON- prince doesnot mean much more than justice of the peace 
oh i guess that part of -PRON- be all right 
kerr thoughtfully wrinkle -PRON- nose 
china be a republic now i believe or be up to day before yesterday but there be some sort of an arrangement make i remember for the member of the royal family to keep -PRON- rank and this guy must be one of -PRON- 
prince chu yang of china be the way -PRON- have get -PRON- bill on the bulletin board 
come to think of -PRON- too -PRON- exclaim i hear cap 
blendon tell sleeper that -PRON- be a cousin to the late emperor of china 
a by george monk 
-PRON- fling up -PRON- head with a sudden flash of excitement 
if this thing as -PRON- say -PRON- be -PRON- may be able to save -PRON- bacon 
hold on a minute caution darwin start to celebrate too soon get to catch -PRON- rabbit -PRON- know before -PRON- can cook -PRON- and wonder just a bit how be go to manage -PRON- royal highness and make -PRON- understand what be after 
ten to one none of the party can speak a word of english 
ah where -PRON- uncle gyrus play trump kerr cry exuberantly 
-PRON- never hear -PRON- spout chinee do -PRON- monk 
well i can good enough anyhow to make -PRON- understand 
i pick -PRON- up from old hop lee -PRON- cook out at santa barbara 
but even so darwin still shake -PRON- head how will -PRON- get to the prince to tell -PRON- what -PRON- want 
how 
kerr shoot -PRON- a glance of wither disdain 
how 
why bawl -PRON- at -PRON- from the rank if i have to -PRON- bonehead 
never fear but what get to -PRON- somehow 
a chance like this come too pat to let -PRON- slip through -PRON- finger 
so all that evening the two scheme and plot to the utter neglect of -PRON- duty and when at last the bugle sound light out kerr retire firm in the belief that the problem have be solve and feel as if the load of care -PRON- have be carry for so many month at last have fall from -PRON- shoulder 
do any uneasy foreboding trouble -PRON- pillow that night warn -PRON- of the consequence of -PRON- propose action consequence that be to lead -PRON- halfway around the world and test -PRON- fiber in the fire of great experience 
truth to tell no 
the routine of a day at west point with -PRON- rigorous grind be hardly conducive to vision either prophetic or otherwise 
a slumbering young giant mosely lie there on -PRON- narrow army cot deepbreathe oblivious to both -PRON- past and -PRON- future while destiny perch on -PRON- footboard and wait for the day there s many a sup pride -PRON- on always be prepare 
less than twentyfour hour notice have be give of the impending royal visit yet at noon when the party arrive arrangement have be complete cover every detail for the proper reception of the prince -PRON- daughter the princess chu sing who accompany -PRON- and the various member of -PRON- retinue 
kerr mosely painfully bugle cadet slang for stall at a recitation in mathematic feel -PRON- heart leap with a thrill of excitement when -PRON- hear the rap of the professor call a halt for the dismissal of the section and the subsequent announcement that all member of the corps don full dress be to hold -PRON- ready for immediate assembly 
in spite of the notice on the bulletinboard kerr have be haunt with anxious fear lest something may happen to interfere with the coming of the party but now with the assurance that the prince have actually arrive -PRON- shoot a glance of purposeful significance at darwin and -PRON- heart beat high with a spirit of adventure 
colonel vance the superintendent rig out in all the regalia of -PRON- position chapeau goldfringe epaulet and clank sword and surround by -PRON- equally glittering staff meet the distinguished visitor at the station and extend -PRON- a ceremonious welcome 
then as the cannon roar out a royal salute -PRON- be escort up the hill where the corps be draw up a long gray line in front of barrack present faultlessly as the cavalcade whirl by 
stand at rigid attention kerr scan the impassive oriental face of the prince and -PRON- suite as -PRON- stare phlegmatically about at the gray battlemented building and the sparkle sweep of snowcovered plain 
out of the corner of -PRON- mouth -PRON- whisper to darwin who stand next -PRON- seem to be much difference in look do there between a royal chink and one of the ordinary washeewashee variety -PRON- comment 
there isnot darwin respond with assurance 
all chink run in one of two pattern either fat and greasy or skinny and dry up -PRON- remember pipe off the member of the chinese embassy when -PRON- be down at the inauguration at washington 
no -PRON- donot need to be afraid of brace this prince i tell -PRON- 
just make -PRON- think -PRON- be talk to some old laundryman 
there be no chance to say more at the moment for with the conclusion of the salute the battalion be relieve until the time set for an exhibition drill later in the afternoon all except the member of the third division who be order to shape -PRON- room immediately for special inspection by the visitor 
kerr and darwin be among those so designated hurry off to busy -PRON- with broom and dustpan in tidy up 
-PRON- have expect this and never have -PRON- go at the distasteful chambermaid work of -PRON- joint establishment with such zest and anticipation for upon the forthcoming inspection -PRON- be base all -PRON- hope 
that have seem to -PRON- the propitious moment for prefer -PRON- request to the prince and -PRON- have rehearse again and again the scene -PRON- expect to be enact 
know the custom of visitor on such occasion -PRON- never doubt but that the prince would make some comment or ask a question regard the arrangement of the room 
-PRON- may address the cadet directly although -PRON- believe -PRON- more probable that -PRON- would speak through an interpreter 
in either case this be to be opportunity 
-PRON- would give the answer in chinese and the prince surprise and interested at hear -PRON- own language speak would hardly fail to pursue the conversation and thus afford an opening for broach the allimportant subject 
indeed -PRON- seem to the two cadet that no possible bar could now arise to the complete success of -PRON- project 
every circumstance be in -PRON- favor 
the chinese from the time of li hang chang down have be give to ask question at every opportunity and so infrequently must -PRON- be that the prince hear -PRON- speak to in -PRON- own tongue that use of -PRON- would almost certainly stir -PRON- to feeling of goodwill 
and now the footstep of the party could be hear upon the stair 
hastily the two assume an attitude of rigid attention as -PRON- await the expect knock upon the door breath go a little faster and -PRON- involuntarily brace -PRON- for the ordeal 
the footstep be at the very threshold now 
but there be no knock on the door 
without pause the party pass on down the corridor 
blankly the cadet stare at each other 
for some reason or caprice -PRON- could not tell why possibly from the sheer malevolence of fate the superintendent have choose not to show -PRON- quarter 
maybe -PRON- will stop in on -PRON- way back ventured monk hopefully although -PRON- lip be pale 
but kerr only shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- sink down miserably in a chair and bury -PRON- head in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- chance be go and -PRON- know -PRON- 
-PRON- be not a nature though to cry long over spilt milk or to languish in defeat 
indeed when -PRON- drop -PRON- head into -PRON- arm -PRON- be lessin token of surrender than to review the situation and to ponder what step next to take 
and now -PRON- straighten up suddenly -PRON- jaw set a glint of determination in -PRON- eye 
by jove not go to fess out a like this without get even a lookin -PRON- declare hotly 
where there s a will there s always a way 
monk what be the order for the day 
exhibition drill this afternoon 
there go the bugle for -PRON- now 
then tonight there s a reception at the supe house 
ah 
kerr exclaim 
a reception eh 
yes but that s for officer only 
no chance to horn in there 
i donot know old man but what -PRON- only hope be to shout out an at the prince from the rank as -PRON- first suggest 
no mosely shake -PRON- head as -PRON- struggle into the sleeve of -PRON- overcoat 
america first -PRON- boy 
-PRON- mustnot let these foreigner get the impression that there be any ragged discipline here 
besides -PRON- would only prejudice old against -PRON- 
these oriental be great stickler for etiquette and ceremony -PRON- know 
no -PRON- repeat get a well scheme than that 
invitation or no invitation i be go to that reception 
accordingly there be no disturbance or undignified interruption in the exhibition drill to which -PRON- now betake -PRON- 
with the rest of the battalion kerr and darwin slosh around through the snow of the parade ground in a series of evolution which cause the somber eye of the chinese prince to lighten with a gleam of wonder as -PRON- admiringly clap -PRON- gloved palm 
the shy fawnlike little princess chu sing wrap in -PRON- fur also applaud daintily 
with asiatic reserve -PRON- show nothing that be in -PRON- mind but down in -PRON- heart -PRON- think -PRON- have never see a more inspiring sight than these sturdy young son of mar 
and when -PRON- pass in review company front with line as straight as rule edge -PRON- brown cheek glow with an irrepressible touch of color and the breath come fast between -PRON- part lip 
after the drill be over and along toward dusk a gentle south wind spring up bring with -PRON- a distinct moderation in temperature 
at about the same time light begin to glow out from the window of the superintendent residence and busy preparation be in progress for the evening entertainment 
how the ensue complication occur no one afterward be able to determine 
-PRON- be a grave misdemeanor to tamper with the guard roster of an army post and certainly not one ordinarily apt to be attempt for the purpose of hog extra duty 
yet strangely enough when the commandant that evening instruct the first sergeant of company to detail a cadet as a special sentinel for the superintendent quarter during the hour of the reception the name find decorate the top of the roster be that of cadet mosely 
-PRON- be quite out of order kerr belong properly almost at the foot of the list but the first sergeant be a rather dense youth a slave to routine perhaps that fact have also be reckon on and when -PRON- see the name there that settle -PRON- 
the assignment assure kerr prepare for -PRON- with the good -PRON- division could furnish 
a pair of new trouser be requisition from a plebe whose waist measure and length of limb approximate own darwin contribute a dresscoat with a prayer that the seam may hold some one else give a shako and the various remain article of apparel be borrow from other room along the corridor either with or without the consent of the owner 
if one be possibly to hobnob with royalty one want to put one good foot forward even though -PRON- be in another fellow shoe 
so thus accouter and with the cape of -PRON- gray overcoat throw jauntily back to show -PRON- emancipate status as an upper classman kerr emerge from barrack and strode across the quadrangle 
nine oclock find -PRON- at the superintendent door and a regular answer -PRON- ring 
inform colonel vance that cadet mosely report as order 
with mili432 tary punctilio -PRON- bring -PRON- gun sharply to an order 
the soldier vanish and in a few minute the colonel resplendent in gold lace appear 
but the dazzle of the colonel raiment be not reflect in -PRON- countenance 
-PRON- seem perplexed annoyed perturb 
kerr however pay no heed 
erect as strain dresscoat and the corset of a west pointer trunkmuscle train to the quality of whalebone and temper steel could make -PRON- -PRON- riflesalute 
cadet mosely report sir as order 
mr mosely do -PRON- say peer at -PRON- from under bushy gray eyebrow 
even yet the superintendent appear incredulous 
yes sir briskly 
humph 
i have hardly expect to see -PRON- 
the superintendent bite -PRON- lip in indecision 
-PRON- be most irregular that a cadet who be practically under charge should be act as a sentinel 
yet to go through the red tape necessary to secure a substitute at this late hour would be impracticable and anyhow -PRON- have a dozen other thing to look after 
as -PRON- debate the question -PRON- raise another issue 
may i remind -PRON- cadet mosely that the communication -PRON- promise in answer to -PRON- question of yesterday be not yet in hand 
kerr have rather expect this and be prepare 
reach inside -PRON- blouse -PRON- draw out the letter -PRON- have write the day before and hand -PRON- over 
the colonel start to tear open the envelope then pause and hold -PRON- thoughtfully in -PRON- hand 
mr mosely if this should contain what i fear -PRON- do i should be force to order -PRON- under arrest and that would necessitate -PRON- secure another sentinel 
consequently i shall leave -PRON- unread until tomorrow 
-PRON- turn and lay the letter away in the drawer of a desk which stand there in the hall 
kerr could hardly repress a gasp of relief 
that have be the one weak spot in -PRON- scheme the moment -PRON- have fear and now -PRON- have surmount -PRON- successfully 
the rest would be easy sailing 
yoif will continue -PRON- detail therefore proceed the colonel curtly 
take -PRON- post on that short walk 
-PRON- point to a gravel path which run along the side of the house 
at the order burgeon elation evaporate like a cloud of steam strike by a sudden current of frosty air 
-PRON- have be -PRON- idea that -PRON- would be station at the front door where even though -PRON- fail to encounter the prince -PRON- -PRON- be almosf certain to gain speech with some member of the suite either go in or come out 
but off at the side where there be no chance of meet any one but a kitchenmaid or one of the caterer man -PRON- may as well be in -PRON- own room at barracks 
-PRON- will remain on duty go on the colonel pitilessly until after the reception be over and under no circumstance be -PRON- to allow any one except -PRON- own domestic to pass -PRON- 
those be -PRON- order

-PRON- be too overwhelmed to hear a slight rustling on the stair overhead or to notice two shadowy feminine figure watch the interview from the landing 
then take -PRON- post direct the colonel 
and with another faltering salute kerr obey 
cadet mosely begin to pace -PRON- gravel walk between -PRON- two bank of melt snow

the prince do not especially impress -PRON- be of that pattern of chinaman which darwin have describe as skinny and dry up and like the gentleman of -PRON- suite attire in american evening dress with only a broad yellow ribbon to indicate -PRON- rank 
the princess and -PRON- lady in attendance on the contrary be in native costume and prove far more satisfying to the critical eye of the observer on the walk 
indeed mosely always a susceptible youth may readily have lose -PRON- heart to the delicate little ivorytinted lady who look as if -PRON- may have step out of a fan have -PRON- not be for the surpass charm of one of -PRON- fair associate 
this girl show scarcely a trace of the mongolian characteristic

in short -PRON- be a girl of today lovely laugh wholesome unaffected 
-PRON- wear a short jacket of brocade ivory silk fasten with button of carve jade and catch by curiously set pearl pin and a skirt of heavy satin of the same shade reach hardly to the ankle display underneath the goldfringe pantaloon and tiny embroidered slipper 
-PRON- hair wear low over -PRON- ear and under a net of gem only serve to accentuate with -PRON- hint of an unchanging fashion the difference between -PRON- and -PRON- companion 
some femme that mutter kerr slow up in -PRON- stride to gaze upon the entrancing vision 
i guess -PRON- would go bad to have -PRON- up here in the summertime and take -PRON- for a stroll around flirtation not 
-PRON- halt suddenly a jealous frown crease -PRON- feature as -PRON- see -PRON- talk and smile up into the face of the despised crosby 
what can -PRON- see in that rotten quill -PRON- snarl disgustedly as the two saunter away together out of sight and -PRON- resume -PRON- solitary pacing 
eleven oclock come and with the band strike up the star spangle banner the company inside form for a gala entry into the ballroom the colonel and -PRON- royal guest lead the van 
outside the lonely sentry fairly drag -PRON- foot strive not to keep step to the music and choke down the lump which the familiar refrain bring to -PRON- throat for rail as -PRON- would at the misery of cadet life there be bitterness in -PRON- heart at the thought of leave the gray old academy with -PRON- many fond association and -PRON- be more than loath to give up the military career to which -PRON- have dedicate -PRON- almost since the time -PRON- have lay aside pinafore 
yet -PRON- be useless to repine 
-PRON- know that -PRON- be mark for expulsion as inevitably as that sun would rise 
and what would -PRON- stem old father have to say to this final outcome 
ah that be a question on which the cul prit do not dare to reflect 
with head down engross in -PRON- moody meditation -PRON- lag up and down the stretch of gravel walk oblivious to everything save -PRON- own trouble until suddenly the sound of a soft footstep and the sight of two figure loom up dimly almost directly in front of -PRON- bring -PRON- to a recollection of -PRON- duty 
halt -PRON- challenge throw -PRON- gun viciously to a port 
who go there 
and then -PRON- almost fall over backward for as the moon sail from under a cloud -PRON- see laugh out at -PRON- from a muffle of wrap the face of the antipodean divinity at whom -PRON- have gaze through the window while close behind -PRON- equally shroud be the figure of the little princess dainty shy and lovely

-PRON- coolly turn the key in the door and wave one hand toward the window while -PRON- slick down -PRON- light hair with the other 
softie of the kid may want to come in -PRON- explain and i have something important to say 
letha still stand near the window which be partly open 
if the stranger have expect -PRON- to betray emotion at -PRON- word or apprehension because -PRON- have lock the door -PRON- be disappoint 
-PRON- calmly wait for -PRON- to go on 
-PRON- name be marcus tolman 
i be in the law office of strike boxall in philadelphia 
when john landon be charge with steal five hundred dollar from the cashier office at the imperial market where -PRON- be employ three month ago i handle the case for the firm 
landon get away 
-PRON- know that -PRON- take the name of claude miller 
i have succeed in trace -PRON- here to bellsville 
well do not get here till late last night and i make the mistake of not arrest -PRON- as soon as i find out where -PRON- be 
when i go to harden house this morning i find -PRON- have skip 
-PRON- look as if -PRON- may have be tip off 
brooke could not tell -PRON- anything about -PRON- 
i didnot tell -PRON- that landon marry -PRON- sister 
but i know -PRON- be teach school here and naturally i come to see what -PRON- have to say 
what do -PRON- expect -PRON- to say -PRON- ask icily 
oh now miss severly what s the use get the good on landon and i donot think -PRON- would be hard to prove that -PRON- help -PRON- to get away from that farmhouse last night 
i know -PRON- have a letter from philadelphia yesterday afternoon and guess that -PRON- be tell i be come and be ask to give landon word of -PRON- if -PRON- see -PRON- 
-PRON- guess be interesting 
but i have no comment to make 
if this be all -PRON- have to say -PRON- finish the sentence by walk past -PRON- quite unhurriedly and unlock the door open the door yet -PRON- request -PRON- smirk wider than ever only tell -PRON- part of what come to tell find the rest of -PRON- even more interesting than -PRON- guess 
-PRON- may be chance that have bring -PRON- and john landon to this place but i be a lawyer and i have a way of put this and that together 
i have to open the afternoon session of school in a few minute -PRON- interrupt 
all right be brief 
-PRON- come here at the request of somebody probably -PRON- sister to find out if -PRON- could whether -PRON- husband have any claim on the harden brooke farm which be own by a john landon a hundred year ago 
the present john landon or claude miller come because -PRON- be down and out and -PRON- think -PRON- may give -PRON- a lift 
do -PRON- know sam vane of linhampton hear of -PRON- 
well -PRON- s a mighty slick policeman and -PRON- s help -PRON- in this case 
but to come to the point 
i know where there be a will that give the whole farm with everything on -PRON- to john landon 
the old man make the will after the one bequeath the property to -PRON- daughter son who be harden grandfather how -PRON- have come down to brooke 
-PRON- have no more right to that farm than i have 
a i donot see how that can be -PRON- break in with sudden indignation i have be tell that -PRON- have be allow to run even bad than in the original john time and that mr brooke have work hard on -PRON- for ten year to bring -PRON- to -PRON- present satisfactory condition 
that should give -PRON- a right to the farm independently of any will 
-PRON- dear girl -PRON- flash a look at -PRON- that cause -PRON- to change -PRON- form of address and seem to jolt -PRON- watery eye closer together 
miss severly i mean 
there can be no right except under the law 
i will show -PRON- or tell -PRON- where that will be so that john landon and of course -PRON- sister will get this farm 
all i ask be a thousand dollar cash 
the farm be value at ten thousand 
a thousand for -PRON- service be too little but i want to see the rightful heir get -PRON- own 
then there be another consideration 
i be here to have john landon arrest and take back to philadelphia 
if i make this arrangement with -PRON- through -PRON- why i be able to find -PRON- 
-PRON- understand 
-PRON- give -PRON- a sly wink that make -PRON- finger itch to bestow a ring slap on -PRON- pasty face 
all -PRON- do however be to take up the school bell from -PRON- desk 
i see 
school be go to take up again -PRON- squeak -PRON- smirk widening 
well come back at five oclock for -PRON- answer and i would advise -PRON- to be here then if -PRON- want to keep -PRON- sister husband out of jail 
as for the will i donot mind tell -PRON- that -PRON- isnot a thousand mile from the old farmhouse over there for the present 
i wish i could come to school to -PRON- 
only afraid be make love to -PRON- teacher 
marcus tolman make a quick exit 
perhaps -PRON- be well for -PRON- that -PRON- do 
there be a heavy ebony ruler on letha desk and -PRON- drop the bell to reach for -PRON- just as the check suit follow the aggressive yellow shoe out of the door 
the girl shrug -PRON- shoulder and laugh as the door close 
nevertheless two tear of angry annoyance appear like dewdrop on -PRON- cheek 
-PRON- brush -PRON- away quickly but -PRON- could not brush away the feeling of humiliation cause by the interview that have be force upon -PRON- 
the coarseness of mr tolman have seem to exhale from -PRON- person so that letha feel actually sticky with -PRON- 
-PRON- glance up at the clock 
-PRON- be time to call the child in 
but -PRON- do not take up the bell again just then 
instead -PRON- lock the door and open one belong to a little room at the back of -PRON- desk which have be an extra classroom at one time when the attendance be much large and which no one enter but -PRON- 
come out john -PRON- call in a low tone 
the person who step out be none other than john landon know to harden brooke as claude miller 
-PRON- wear the old coat and trouser in which -PRON- have drop from the hayloft the afternoon before 
but -PRON- have on one of clean gray flannel shirt and in -PRON- hand be the soft hat which harden have carry up to -PRON- room at five oclock in the morning 
have -PRON- go be -PRON- anxious question 
yes -PRON- can see -PRON- through the window go down the road to the village 
i wish i could have get -PRON- other thing besides the shirt and hat 
but i couldnot 
i wrap those up in paper and even then i feel as if i be not act quite square with marion 
-PRON- always act square letha -PRON- declare earnestly 
do tolman know i be still about here afraid -PRON- do 
what shall i do 
i donot want to be lug back to philadelphia 
-PRON- will find -PRON- guilty if ever -PRON- put -PRON- on trial 
i be innocent but i donot see how to prove -PRON- 
besides there be that automobile i take to get away in 
i leave -PRON- at the side of the road when i see a chance to jump a freight for the west 
but -PRON- will say i steal -PRON- just the same an unlucky devil 
if -PRON- wasnot for nettie and the kid swipe a gun and end -PRON- all 
say a thing like that again and do -PRON- for -PRON- -PRON- with this ruler threaten letha the impatience that go with redgold hair flame up suddenly get to get that jewelry back to harden brooke before -PRON- can commit suicide 
-PRON- know that donot -PRON- 
i know -PRON- say -PRON- grumble miller ungraciously 
and i mean -PRON- 
i hate to do -PRON- 
i donot know whether i can 
there be other who have something to say about that 
how do i know that -PRON- will let -PRON- 
-PRON- give -PRON- a look that make -PRON- shuffle -PRON- foot nervously 
this slight little of -PRON- always have have a way of make -PRON- stand around when -PRON- all live in philadelphia 
now that -PRON- be in a bad fix than -PRON- ever have be in before with three charge of robbery threaten -PRON- be take hold of -PRON- affair with a firmness which -PRON- feel be the only thing that may save -PRON- from prison 
get back into that room till school be over -PRON- order as -PRON- look at -PRON- pleadingly very much like a dog expect a whipping 
then tell -PRON- what -PRON- be to do 
i must have a little time to think -PRON- all out 
-PRON- never seem to -PRON- that -PRON- need to study a thing much 
-PRON- idea come to -PRON- all work out and by george -PRON- be always good 
with this tribute -PRON- move back into the little room and -PRON- close and lock the door 
then -PRON- ring the bell for the afternoon session 
meanwhile marcus tolman walk down the road make -PRON- own plan which be not intend to benefit either letha severly or -PRON- weakfibered brotherinlaw 
a leave the bate home and the longlegged raymond call for -PRON- chauffeur harden drive to bellsville at a speed that barely miss recklessness 
something have to be think up to meet the horrible situation in which -PRON- find -PRON- 
how be -PRON- to explain to raymond bate that -PRON- could not produce the jewelry for inspection without admit that -PRON- have be steal again 
harden have faith in -PRON- own ability to run down the thief eventually but in the mean time -PRON- must keep the loss of the jewel a secret 
-PRON- would be bad enough to admit -PRON- when -PRON- have fail 
but -PRON- would not fail 
once let -PRON- get -PRON- hand on claude miller which should not be difficult and the booty would be recover as a natural sequence 
-PRON- drive -PRON- car into the bam and assure -PRON- with a sigh of relief that the bate machine be nowhere in sight -PRON- walk thoughtfully over to the house 
the telephone bell rang as -PRON- enter 
-PRON- be gertie kelly call to tell -PRON- that -PRON- have warn everybody west and south to look out for claude miller and that -PRON- have all promise to do so

-PRON- like to talk to the goodlooke young farmer whom none of the girl have be able to charm and besides -PRON- be desperate in -PRON- curiosity to learn what be at the bottom of this claude mill affair 
-PRON- suspect that -PRON- be much more important than harden have intimate

i hope -PRON- will hope so 
do -PRON- think -PRON- will get the thing back persisted gertie before -PRON- could hang up

while garrett go about -PRON- work with an industry and skilfulness only second to -PRON- employer harden look carefully through -PRON- big wood lot and assure -PRON- that claude miller be not there 
all the rest of the day -PRON- spend in ride about in -PRON- car visit many of -PRON- neighbor and make constant inquiry 
-PRON- have no success and -PRON- puzzle -PRON- 
what have become of the man

-PRON- could not help pull up to look through the window 
-PRON- have a blur vision of group of restless head and shoulder but could not find among -PRON-

i havenot find mill -PRON- announce havenot see -PRON- have -PRON- 
-PRON- tone and manner be matteroffact but there be a glint in -PRON- eye as -PRON- look at the flushed cheek of this girl who have stir -PRON- more in a few day than all the gertie kelly have be able to do in year 
-PRON- have a man work for -PRON- havenot -PRON- -PRON- ask evade -PRON- query see somebody in that field above the barn

will -PRON- sleep in the house 
no give -PRON- a cot i have in the loft over the stable 
-PRON- use to sleep there about half the time when -PRON- be with -PRON- before 
-PRON- would rather be there than in a regular bed tramp and beat -PRON- way all over the country work in dakota for two year and -PRON- say the good bedroom in the world be a move boxcar 
well i wonot keep -PRON- from -PRON- school 
if -PRON- should happen to hear anything of miller but of course -PRON- wonot 
how could -PRON- 
-PRON- acknowledge -PRON- smile goodby with a wave of -PRON- gloved hand and drive down the road to -PRON- ftrnv as -PRON- get there -PRON- see a big gray car glide easily to a smooth halt in front of the barn and raymond bate hail -PRON- from a seat by the side of the driver 
here -PRON- be brooke 
hope i havenot keep -PRON- wait 
well the crucial moment have arrive 
now what be -PRON- to do 
i suppose -PRON- have the jewelry at the house 
run the car to the side of the road turner -PRON- direct -PRON- chauffeur 
now brooke if -PRON- be ready 
raymond bate have be accustom all -PRON- life to have thing do for -PRON- as -PRON- want without trouble to -PRON- 
a -PRON- have tell harden that -PRON- would be there to identify the jewelry belong to -PRON- mother and -PRON- never doubt that -PRON- would be produce 
-PRON- saunter up the lawn by the side of harden chatting on indifferent matter entirely at -PRON- ease 
-PRON- do not notice that -PRON- companion sunbrowne face show a peculiar white spot in the middle of each cheek or that the lip be draw so tightly over the tooth that -PRON- too be a purplishwhite 
marion peep at -PRON- from -PRON- kitchen and there be anxious sympathy in -PRON- eye as -PRON- meet the fix gaze of -PRON- brother 
then -PRON- go back and shut the door 
-PRON- could do nothing but somehow -PRON- have faith that harden would find some way out of -PRON- dilemma 
indeed -PRON- have hit upon a plan that would give -PRON- more time 
that -PRON- feel be all -PRON- need 
time 
if -PRON- could have a day or two -PRON- would find this wretched tramp who have steal the treasure 
-PRON- lead -PRON- visitor into the office 
ah i see 
in that safe exclaimed bate nodding approval 
-PRON- look strong enough to hold a king ransom 
open -PRON- up brooke 
harden go over to the safe and turn the knob as if -PRON- be work the combination 
-PRON- do this for more than a minute 
then -PRON- stand up and look in dismay at bate the trouble old top ask raymond 
forget the number 
-PRON- ought to open murmured harden as if reflectively try -PRON- again 
with deliberate care as -PRON- seem -PRON- turn the knob a certain number of time each way watch closely to see that the pointer always stop at the right place 
then -PRON- try the handle as -PRON- have do before 
but the safe would not open 
-PRON- must be out of order -PRON- say in a distressed tone 
unlucky when -PRON- want to see the jewelry so particularly 
perhaps i didnot do -PRON- right try once more 
but the next attempt be without result 
so be two more that -PRON- make 
sure -PRON- know the combination ask bate light a cigarette and immediately throw -PRON- to the floor and stamp out the fire in -PRON- impatience 
maybe -PRON- have the wrong figure 
have -PRON- get -PRON- write down 
no 
but quite sure of -PRON- use -PRON- a dozen time since have the safe 
but this isnot the first time -PRON- hasnot work 
i may have to get a man to come from syracuse to open -PRON- 
i canot do -PRON- today however better call -PRON- off for this time and telephone -PRON- when i get the door open 
never till now have harden brooke suppose -PRON- could pretend so successfully 
-PRON- be -PRON- disposition to be entirely open and straightforward 
yet here -PRON- be twiddle a knob that -PRON- know have nothing to do with fasten the safe and do -PRON- with an air of sincerity that astonish -PRON- 
i hate to come up here again object bate 
the mater will go into hysteric if i can not satisfy -PRON- this afternoon that -PRON- precious gimcrack be all right 
-PRON- donot know -PRON- mother or -PRON- wouldnot propose to stand -PRON- off even for a day when -PRON- be set on a thing 
harden brooke be rather glad -PRON- do not know the lady if -PRON- be likely to be more insistent than -PRON- son but -PRON- do not say so 
instead -PRON- make one more pretense of try to unlock the safe and shrug -PRON- shoulder with a most edifying look of disappointment when -PRON- fail no use mr bate have to give -PRON- up for today 
i be sorry but -PRON- see for -PRON- that -PRON- canot be help the bad of these burglarproof safes 
when -PRON- do get out of order -PRON- take an expert mechanic to get the door open 
bate be not at all incline to accept this unsatisfactory decision however 
but -PRON- protest 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- perhaps i can before brooke realize what -PRON- intend to do raymond step past -PRON- and seize the knob and handle of the safe give -PRON- a violent pull simultaneously 
the door swing open 
wow ejaculated bate with a triumphant grin 
be the inside door unlocked 
-PRON- be unlocked 
fling -PRON- back -PRON- hurriedly investigate the interior which obviously contain nothing but the scattered law book and paper 
-PRON- turn on harden brooke accusingly 
where be -PRON- -PRON- demand 
there be no jewelry in this safe 
and by the lord harry -PRON- shout this combination knob be nothing but a bluff lethas enigma 
i be not sorry that marcus tolman come at four oclock instead of five as -PRON- have say -PRON- would 
school have be dismiss and the girl be sit at -PRON- desk line of perplexity between -PRON- perfectlyarched brow and a faraway expression in -PRON- eye when -PRON- knock at the door 
then -PRON- see that a horse and buggy be outside -PRON- window and -PRON- recognize -PRON- as the property of the blacksmith in the village 
come in -PRON- call 
tolman smirk at -PRON- confidently 
then -PRON- strike what -PRON- feel be an easy attitude 
lean on a desk with one hand and cross one yellow shoe elegantly over the other -PRON- fan -PRON- with -PRON- straw hat 
-PRON- appointment be for five oclock -PRON- remind -PRON- 
but i borrow the rig -PRON- see out there and get here ahead of time 
i see the child leave so i venture to knock 
-PRON- wait for a response but -PRON- do not speak and -PRON- continue briskly as a lawyer -PRON- be -PRON- custom to come directly to the point 
what be -PRON- answer 
will -PRON- pay -PRON- a thousand dollar for that will 
-PRON- will give john landon the farm and make -PRON- sister comfortable financially for the first time since -PRON- marry -PRON- 
the reply come short and sharp no 
for a moment -PRON- appear to be dumfounde 
then -PRON- ask with ostentatious meekness i beg -PRON- pardon miss severly 
be -PRON- authorize to decline -PRON- offer 
yes 
if -PRON- could have express -PRON- contempt more forcibly than by answer -PRON- in monosyllable -PRON- would have do so 
a look of ratlike cunning spring into -PRON- little eye spread slowly over -PRON- whole visage 
ah 
-PRON- be authorize -PRON- say smoothly 
then -PRON- must have see john landon since this morning 
-PRON- see that -PRON- be try to trap -PRON- but there be no sign of trepidation as -PRON- return coldly there be nothing else i believe 
-PRON- move toward the door 
only that -PRON- be part of -PRON- offer to quash the philadelphia charge against john landon alias claude miller forget that 
-PRON- do not reply and with -PRON- oily smirk in full working order belie the malice in -PRON- shifty eye tolman walk out 
through the window -PRON- watch -PRON- drive down the road until -PRON- reach the bend which would take -PRON- to bellsville 
then lock the outer door -PRON- open the one belong to the little room and speak to -PRON- brotherinlaw without let -PRON- come out 
-PRON- be quite sure of what -PRON- tell -PRON- this morning -PRON- begin in low distinct tone 
the man who come from the window of the farmhouse give something to the other one who be wait 
hug -PRON- together with a shiver of vague terror -PRON- pass a limp hand across -PRON- mouth and reply in a tone of puerile petulance of course sure 
the moon hadnot quite go down 
-PRON- be a little package do up in paper 
i hear the paper crackle 
the other man open -PRON- and hold up something that glitter and sort of tinkle 
hello say that guy must have pinch jewelry while -PRON- be in there 
gee say never mind what -PRON- say -PRON- break in 
what do the man do 
claude miller look pained and -PRON- loose under lip quiver as if -PRON- be about to make a tearful remonstrance 
but -PRON- didnot give -PRON- time 
the quick way will be for -PRON- to repeat -PRON- story as -PRON- tell -PRON- this morning and if i make any mistake -PRON- can correct -PRON- 
but do -PRON- in very few word 
if -PRON- be to keep out of prison -PRON- must hurry 
but letha -PRON- whine 
keep quiet and listen -PRON- admonish 
when i see harden brooke take -PRON- up to -PRON- bedroom last night i have no chance to speak to -PRON- 
but have the letter from margaret tell -PRON- that tolman be come here after -PRON- 
how do -PRON- know i would be here and who tell margaret 
-PRON- silence -PRON- with a flash of -PRON- dark eye and go on rapidly -PRON- poor sister care for -PRON- though -PRON- be such a poor excuse for a man that i donot know why always be good to -PRON- -PRON- bleat 
when i have work and before -PRON- frame that job on -PRON- at the imperial market i give -PRON- all i make and so early this morning -PRON- continue i do what be try to work up courage for all night 
i go up to -PRON- room and tell -PRON- to get away and come here to the school 
yes that be a good thing 
i give -PRON- back the key didnot the tendency of -PRON- mind to run on small thing be characteristic 
-PRON- do a not trouble to answer but warn -PRON- with a gesture to pay attention 
when -PRON- get to the ground -PRON- lie down behind the bush to make sure nobody have see -PRON- 
soon these two man come over the lawn and one of -PRON- climb up to -PRON- window 
-PRON- be in the house about ten minute fifteen i should say 
well fifteen 
then -PRON- come down and give the package to the wait man how -PRON- be assent miller eagerly 
-PRON- talk for a while fuss about who should keep the package 
then the guy who have -PRON- not the one who have be in the house swear and say something i didnot hear except i get the word syracuse and think -PRON- talk about a bank and safe 
i know -PRON- say box 
but -PRON- be all jumble up and -PRON- talk down in -PRON- throat 
there be something about merchandise or mercantile too 
that will do stay here till i come back with some food 
i donot know how long i shall be 
mind -PRON- donot show -PRON- at the window 
-PRON- have open the door and after cautiously survey the road both way be about to step out when claude miller lay a tremulous hand on -PRON- arm 
look here letha 
-PRON- know i didnot do that thing in philadelphia donot -PRON- -PRON- plead 
if i didnot feel certain of -PRON- i wouldnot raise -PRON- hand for -PRON- not even for -PRON- sister sake be -PRON- cleancut answer as -PRON- go out and close the door listen to make sure -PRON- turn the key inside 
any one who may have see this trim pretty girl walk easily down the road in the direction of the harden brooke farm loose end of -PRON- shine hair blow about -PRON- cheek would certainly have be attract by -PRON- elflike beauty 
on the other hand -PRON- would have ridicule the suggestion that weighty matter be on -PRON- mind 
as -PRON- enter the house loud voice in the office make -PRON- pause 
raymond bate and harden brooke be talk over the absence of the jewel from the safe and -PRON- be evident that the former be suspicious yet reputation for absolute honesty and unblemished integrity have spread far beyond the bound of bellsville 
but how do -PRON- account for -PRON- mr brooke 
raymond demand as letha reach the halfopen door 
-PRON- say the jewelry be in this safe andthat the only reason -PRON- could not show -PRON- to -PRON- be that -PRON- couldnot get the door open 
yet when i open -PRON- very easily consider that -PRON- couldnot do -PRON- with all -PRON- trouble there be nothing inside but a few book and bundle of law paper 
the question be where be -PRON- mother jewel 
mechanically harden fumble among the paper in the safe while -PRON- mind work busily 
-PRON- could not see a way out but -PRON- be some relief not to be oblige to look into raymond incredulous face 
harden be not use to deception 
-PRON- canot find -PRON- can -PRON- barked raymond 
no 
-PRON- certainly be not here 
well then what be -PRON- theory 
raymond bate be the son of a wealthy man and most of -PRON- time be devoted to the mere joy of living 
but -PRON- have inherit the business instinct and -PRON- tone be hard 
there be only one theory reply harden 
that be that the jewelry must have be steal for the second time 
that seem to be the only explanation assent raymond with a keen look 
yet i donot understand why -PRON- could not open the door when -PRON- give way at -PRON- first pull 
that be very simple 
everybody know that often a defective lock will stick fast for a long time and then all at once without any apparent reason yield of -PRON- own accord 
this safe lock have -PRON- whim like any other 
-PRON- wei at this moment that harden catch sight of letha stand at the door 
-PRON- be quick to seize an opportunity by speak to -PRON- to turn raymond thought in another direction for a few moment 
good afternoon letha 
good afternoon -PRON- respond 
i beg -PRON- pardon if i be intrude 
but i could not help overhear -PRON- say that -PRON- have miss some valuable property and mr raymond bate miss severly interrupt harden introduce -PRON- 
-PRON- smile graciously upon the tall mr bate and -PRON- embarrass by the unexpected advent of a beautiful young woman blush until -PRON- neck face and particularly -PRON- outstanding ear be in a condition of violent inflammation 
miss severly be -PRON- cousin several time remove explain harden 
indeed 
-PRON- be to be pit i mean envy of course 
ahem 
ah 
i er beg -PRON- pardon stammered raymond 
while young mr bate never quite compose in the presence of a pretty girl flounder miserably in -PRON- endeavor to present a graceful front letha convey to harden with a slight raising of -PRON- brow and a lightning dart from -PRON- dark eye that -PRON- must follow -PRON- lead 
be -PRON- the beautiful necklace and thing -PRON- show -PRON- last night that -PRON- be look for in that safe harden -PRON- ask smile 
yes cut in raymond become more coherent when business take the place of social exchange 
-PRON- belong to -PRON- mother 
-PRON- be take from -PRON- house by a burglar who be capture 
later -PRON- be place in the care of mr brooke 
i come here to identify -PRON- 
but when -PRON- open the safe -PRON- be not there interrupt letha still smile 
i could have tell -PRON- that before -PRON- look 
-PRON- break out harden 
why what can -PRON- know about mr bate -PRON- continue calmly ignore interjection that safe be not to be trust 
-PRON- have see that for -PRON- 
the jewelry belong to a -PRON- mother be in a safe deposit box in syracuse in syracuse 
yes 
mr brooke have be away all day 
-PRON- sister and i both know that anybody can open that safe if -PRON- try long enough 
be -PRON- not natural for -PRON- sister and -PRON- cousin to take the liberty of convey such a treasure to a place of real safety 
and what safe place can there be than the vault of a bank 
turn to harden -PRON- add with smile contrition 
i hope -PRON- wonot be angry with -PRON- 
but -PRON- can assure mr bate that the jewelry be in a safe deposit box in syracuse and that -PRON- can be produce when require 
well when can i see -PRON- ask raymond 
-PRON- mother be -PRON- necessary for -PRON- to see -PRON- at all -PRON- ask quickly only to identify -PRON- 
but -PRON- smile 
mr brooke have no package of jewelry except what be take from -PRON- house by the burglar so there canot be any question that -PRON- be mrs property 
-PRON- can set -PRON- mind at ease by tell -PRON- -PRON- be in a place of perfect security in a syracuse bank 
what bank be -PRON- 
-PRON- safe deposit box be in the second mercantile -PRON- reply 
there be a pause during which raymond bate try not to look conscious that -PRON- be gaze at -PRON- with mischievous amusement 
at last -PRON- blurt out very well miss severly 
i will tell -PRON- mother 
-PRON- be er very good of -PRON- to take so much interest in the matter 
i appreciate -PRON- i be sure 
well to be frank mr bate i do -PRON- for -PRON- cousin harden more than for -PRON- 
still i be glad that -PRON- approve what do 
i only hope harden wonot scold -PRON- too much when -PRON- have go 
this be a hint that raymond bate feel oblige to take 
there be no excuse for -PRON- remain any long 
so -PRON- stammer out a confused thank -PRON- miss severly 
good afternoon and manage somehow to get out of the office and the house 
as the big car surge away in a cloud of smoke and dust harden brooke turn to letha with a puzzle smile that be quite without mirth be an ingenious way of e -PRON- out letha say harden look curiously at -PRON- 
but -PRON- be only a temporary expedient 
what shall -PRON- do when -PRON- find -PRON- have be lie to -PRON- 
who say -PRON- have be lie -PRON- counter with an enigmatic smile 
some story that seem doubtful be marvelously like the truth -PRON- think mr bate believe -PRON- 
perhaps 
but -PRON- will be easy for -PRON- to telephone the second mercantile bank in syracuse and find out whether -PRON- have a safe deposit box there or not 
-PRON- canot very well telephone tonight 
by the time -PRON- get back to linhampton there will be nobody at the bank except the night watchman and -PRON- wonot know true admit harden reflectively 
but -PRON- can get the bank in the morning and -PRON- will come to the same thing 
for that matter there may be somebody there tonight who can give -PRON- the information 
-PRON- wonot be late when -PRON- reach home 
i know -PRON- mean well but when -PRON- learn that -PRON- have no box at the second mercantile -PRON- will be so suspicious that i be afraid the whole truth will come out 
look at -PRON- as i may i can see only that i be in a very bad fix 
not so bad but that -PRON- can get out of -PRON- if -PRON- follow carefully the clue in -PRON- hand 
there will be no time for that afraid 
what i have to do first of all be to hide from the batese the fact that -PRON- have no box at the bank 
there be only one way to do that and -PRON- will be an off chance 
what be that way 
for -PRON- to be in syracuse when the bank open in the morning and rent a box 
i should say raymond bate be not an early riser and -PRON- may have the box in -PRON- name before -PRON- telephone 
of course the bank will tell -PRON- so and -PRON- will be satisfied 
-PRON- wonot know how long -PRON- have have -PRON- 
letha look at the office door to satisfy -PRON- that -PRON- be tightly close 
then -PRON- break into a ripple of laughter that harden thought be the most musical sound -PRON- ever have hear and this too in spite of -PRON- be worry almost to despair over -PRON- dilemma 
-PRON- plan have a great deal to recommend -PRON- -PRON- concede as -PRON- laugh quiet down to the smile which always bewitch -PRON- 
but -PRON- be unnecessary 
unnecessary 
what do -PRON- mean 
only that i nee not rent a box in the second mercantile bank because i have a box there already 
and be the jewel in -PRON- 
i do not say so 
-PRON- tell raymond bate -PRON- be 
no 
not even that -PRON- correct 
although i give -PRON- that impression 
if -PRON- will try to recall exactly what be say -PRON- be this after i have tell -PRON- -PRON- mother property be in a box in a syracuse bank -PRON- ask what bank 
i remember perfectly 
and -PRON- recollect that i evade -PRON- question by say -PRON- safe deposit box be in the second mercantile 
yes and of course -PRON- take -PRON- for grant naturally 
-PRON- suppose i mean the jewelry be in that box 
i admit i wish -PRON- to think so 
but -PRON- see i do not actually make such an assertion 
harden brooke draw in and emit a long breath and pass a hand across -PRON- forehead 
this be too deep for -PRON- -PRON- confess 
what do -PRON- all mean 
-PRON- really have a box in the second mercantile bank 
yes 
i rent -PRON- two week ago i have paper of some value as well as other article that i do not care to carry around with -PRON- and -PRON- have be -PRON- custom for a year or two to have a safe deposit box 
-PRON- be not expensive and -PRON- save a great deal of anxiety 
and be mrs diamond there 
no 
if -PRON- be i should have tell -PRON- at once 
but -PRON- add quickly as -PRON- face fall tell -PRON- for -PRON- comfort that i be pretty sure -PRON- be in some safe deposit box in syracuse 
why do -PRON- think so 
i canot tell -PRON- now 
if -PRON- will trust -PRON- for a day or two i feel sure i can lay -PRON- hand on the thief or thief for there be more than one in the plot 
but i must be allow a free hand for the present 
harden gaze earnestly at the fair young face with -PRON- sweetlycurved lip and the eye glisten with selfconfidence 
then -PRON- decide that -PRON- must let -PRON- haye -PRON- way 
i will not interfere with -PRON- -PRON- promise 
thank 
-PRON- smile reassuringly and trip away to talk to marion in the kitchen 
as for harden although -PRON- have pledge -PRON- not to hinder -PRON- plan by ask question or make suggestion -PRON- mentally reserve to -PRON- the privilege of follow any independent line of action that may lead to the recovery of the steal treasure 
the capture of the thief while important be a secondary consideration 
-PRON- go out to the barn where garrett have already begin the feeding and bedding of stock and other stable task that come under the general head of chore 
there be no conversation between the two man 
but harden help in thd work in a way give an occasional brief direction which garrett acknowledge with a grunt 
so -PRON- be not long before everything be do include the milking and pasturing of the cow and harden strode over the lawn for supper 
a am i to come too growled garrett 
i suppose i get supper donot -PRON- employer do not relish have this surly illconditione fellow at the table with marion and letha 
but there be no way out of -PRON- and five minute later garrett be wash -PRON- face and hand outside the kitchen door wait for the call to the meal 
supper be nearly over with nobody speak except in monosyllable when garrett turn to harden hear anything about that fellow who get away with -PRON- stuff last night have -PRON- the man who be work for -PRON- 
no be short reply 
-PRON- must have climb down the ivy out of -PRON- window eh 
i donot know 
garrett scowl at the noncommunicative harden but do not press -PRON- question 
soon -PRON- have finish -PRON- meal and get up from the table abruptly without a word shamble out of the house to lounge about until -PRON- should be time for -PRON- to seek -PRON- cot in the hayloft 
i didnot suppose -PRON- know anything about the robbery say harden as -PRON- watch -PRON- hire man go down the lawn 
who tell -PRON- 
i see -PRON- talk to the driver of that motorcar that bring mr bate answer marion 
afterward when mr bate start home garrett be lean over the car ask something i suppose for i see mr bate speak to -PRON- and garrett nod 
raymond bate be one of those loosemouthe idiot who doesnot know enough to keep -PRON- business to -PRON- comment harden no doubt -PRON- tell garrett all about -PRON- 
letha say nothing 
-PRON- leave the room while marion and -PRON- brother be still talk and hastily collect what food -PRON- could in the kitchen for the hungry claude miller whom -PRON- have leave wait for -PRON- in the schoolhouse 
-PRON- be dark when -PRON- get there but -PRON- do not light any of the lamp 
-PRON- know -PRON- way about well enough to find -PRON- way to the door of the room in which -PRON- have instruct -PRON- to stay 
-PRON- be only when -PRON- find that the door be wide open and that -PRON- do not answer when -PRON- call -PRON- both as claude mill and john -PRON- strike a match and look about -PRON- 
there be no one in the building but -PRON- involuntarily -PRON- let the match bum down almost to -PRON- finger before -PRON- blow -PRON- out 
-PRON- light another quickly for as the flame die down on the first one -PRON- have notice a small folded paper on -PRON- desk 
there be other paper there which have prevent -PRON- observe -PRON- before 
-PRON- read the few pencil word on -PRON- before -PRON- second match be exhaust 
-PRON- be have to leave 
will see -PRON- later 
john 
for a minute or more -PRON- stand in the darkness reflect 
-PRON- be certain to begin with that -PRON- have not leave of -PRON- own volition 
somebody have come and make -PRON- go 
-PRON- must have be marcus tolman 
-PRON- decide also after very short consideration that tolman have not arrest -PRON- 
in the first place -PRON- be not a police officer so could not do so legally and again if -PRON- weakkneed relative be a prisoner of the law -PRON- would have say so 
-PRON- take -PRON- regular seat behind -PRON- desk to think -PRON- out further 
at the end of five minute -PRON- have come to a conclusion 
get up briskly -PRON- leave the schoolhouse and as -PRON- close the door which fasten with a spring lock -PRON- stand and listen 
not a sound indicate the proximity of any one about but -PRON- 
so still carry the parcel of food -PRON- have bring with -PRON- -PRON- go back to the farmhouse 
harden have go out with -PRON- car announce marion 
-PRON- say -PRON- may not be home till late 
a the door and window of the house all secure ask letha when the two young woman have settle down in the spacious livingroom marion sewing and letha with a book 
i do not trust that man garrett 
neither do return marion 
that be why i have lock and bolt jthe outside door and the stair door 
i canot do anything upstairs except shut down the window of the room belong to the hire man because everything be open up there 
but -PRON- can prevent anybody get down to -PRON- 
and there be nothing up there that could be steal 
nothing that i know of 
letha smile and shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- do not know the bate jewelry be up there 
yet -PRON- be and -PRON- seem other people know -PRON- as well as harden 
i should like to look about that upper story if -PRON- will come with -PRON- 
-PRON- may come across something else that would attract burglar now that harden be away 
i wouldnot go up there tonight for a million dollar declare marion 
but i do not expect burglar to come again 
who be to know that harden isnot at home 
-PRON- often go down to the village with -PRON- car in the evening and unless some one be watch nobody could say when -PRON- come back true assented letha 
but i should like to go up to that floor 
those old beam and the way -PRON- be lay have interest -PRON- very much 
not for -PRON- be resolute negative 
if -PRON- want to go do -PRON- 
but i wouldnot if i be -PRON- 
letha drop the subject and seem to bury -PRON- in -PRON- book 
occasionally -PRON- and marion would exchange a few word but most of the time thought be race along as -PRON- try to decide what -PRON- next move should be lead not only to the recovery of the jewel but the capture of the thief as well 
-PRON- would have be comparatively easy if -PRON- have not disappear 
with -PRON- help -PRON- believe -PRON- hold the key to the mystery 
now -PRON- would have to begin all over again 
at nine oclock marion who have be nod for half an hour or more declared that -PRON- must go to bed 
-PRON- be too sleepy to see -PRON- needle and -PRON- have to be up at five -PRON- sleepy letha 
-PRON- ought to be for -PRON- have little rest last night to say nothing of the awful time -PRON- put in with that strange man -PRON- head pain -PRON- 
nothing to speak of be careless response 
i be not at all sleepy just now 
but i dare say i soon shall be 
-PRON- go to bed and stay up and read a while longer 
perhaps harden will be home 
then -PRON- shall both feel safe in -PRON- room 
be -PRON- certain to be very late 
i donot know go on business about the robbery 
i think -PRON- s hear something about that claude miller 
of course -PRON- be the thief 
but harden may be home soon 
-PRON- only say -PRON- may be late 
well go to bed -PRON- add with a yawn as -PRON- get up from -PRON- chair 
good night dear 
-PRON- be very lonely when marion have go into -PRON- room and close the door and letha wonder why the wind always blow so much hard around the house than elsewhere 
for half an hour -PRON- sit book in hand listening 
then -PRON- get up and softly open the door of room which like -PRON- own adjoin the livingroom 
marion be fast asleep 
-PRON- be now that letha do a peculiar thing 
-PRON- go into the office where the big safe be the principal article of furniture but which contain besides an a open rolltop desk and take from a pigeonhole in the desk an electric flashlight 
then -PRON- open the door of the stairway and go softly to the floor above 
-PRON- shudder as -PRON- pass the open trap above the stairway and have difficulty in repress a scream when some unseen creature flap loudly almost in -PRON- very face 
but -PRON- hold herselfin and indulge in a little smile at -PRON- own fear 
-PRON- remember that bat hold high carnival at night in this ghostly place 
harden brooke have tell -PRON- so more than once 
the bat fly out of one of the big window opening and letha go about -PRON- investigation with businesslike composure 
that -PRON- be possess of strong nerve notwithstanding -PRON- delicate frame and sweet face have be demonstrate already 
-PRON- feel that -PRON- need all -PRON- nerve now 
on the other hand -PRON- do not hesitate in the task -PRON- have set -PRON- which be to find the will for which marcus tolman have demand a thousand dollar 
-PRON- have be indiscreet enough to admit that -PRON- be not a thousand mile from the farmhouse and letha have soon come to the conclusion that if old john landon have secrete -PRON- anywhere most probably -PRON- be here among these ancient beam and rafter 
-PRON- have be up here before and have notice the star and arrow cut into the beam even before marion who have accompany -PRON- point -PRON- out 
-PRON- have see the initial too 
when tolman talk about the will -PRON- be natural for letha to associate these symbol and letter with the unknown hidingplace 
that tolman have take -PRON- brotherinlaw away from the schoolhouse -PRON- feel sure 
also -PRON- believe -PRON- disappearance have something to do with this will that tolman mean to turn to -PRON- own profit 
-PRON- purpose be to obtain possession of -PRON- before the rascal could get -PRON- 
then -PRON- could bargain with -PRON- on behalf of the unfortunate john landon who be so pitifully unable to take care of -PRON- 
the swinge beam under which have be hide the bate jewelry and where harden brooke have find the old coin be still displace and -PRON- do not take a girl of letha quickness of apprehension long to understand the principle on which -PRON- have be make to move when properly manipulate 
-PRON- argue that other beam may be swing aside if one know the secret of -PRON- 
so -PRON- try two of -PRON- but without result 
then -PRON- turn the light of -PRON- flash on the arrow and star alternately until with a low ejaculation of satisfaction -PRON- believe -PRON- have hit on the solution 
examine the star closely -PRON- note that -PRON- have five ray 
also that one ray be noticeably long than any of the other 
take this as a guide -PRON- find that -PRON- point to a place midway between two of the beam 
for a moment -PRON- be at a loss 
then throw -PRON- light upon the arrow -PRON- observe that -PRON- aim in the same parallel direction as the long ray of the star but three foot to the left 
between the two imaginary line be a beam 
a pause for inspection and calculation and letha be work to remove a wooden tongue like that which have be find by harden in another beam and which -PRON- have accidentally break off 
-PRON- do not take -PRON- long to decide that -PRON- must have some sharp tool to get the tongue out 
-PRON- look about -PRON- but there be nothing there 
a little shrug of vexation and down -PRON- go cautiously to the kitchen where -PRON- know a box of carpenter tool be keep 
in a few minute -PRON- be up again with a chisel and hatchet 
naturally handy -PRON- do not take -PRON- long with the aid of these implement to extract the tongue 
then with slight exertion -PRON- swing the beam aside and upward reveal the same sort of cavity as that in which harden have so vainly secrete the bate jewelry -PRON- have just time to take out two fold paper yellow by age and to replace the beam with the tongue thrust back into place when a slight scraping outside one of the yawn window opening make -PRON- switch off the light and hide behind a pile of old lumber in a far corner 
listen intently -PRON- know that the scraping be cause by the placing of a ladder against the outside wall 
-PRON- could hear labor breathing and then three man crawl in and stand still 
-PRON- be very dark but the star enable -PRON- to make out the outline of the three intruder 
-PRON- see that one be thin and rather tall another short and stocky of build and the third a burly individual who seem to be in command 
to be conclude course when a man be be pay a hundred and forty a month by a young millionaire as wireless operator on say millionaire yacht and -PRON- be only a secondrate amateur at wireless anyhow -PRON- hardly appropriate to step up to the gift horse pull -PRON- tooth apart and start criticise the beast 
but i maintain a certain degree of independence by quarrel with -PRON- boss about twice as often as i really want to 
i have get through college on the money -PRON- have pay -PRON- to get -PRON- through 
but -PRON- lord man i have once demand of -PRON- what in the world be -PRON- get out of -PRON- education 
an awful lot of fun -PRON- old grind louis hartman have retort 
and the use of -PRON- brain be the least expensive part of most of -PRON- 
but what will -PRON- know 
why should i know anything 
always sure of be able to hire somebody else to do the know 
-PRON- be wofully true 
the million old gottfrie hartmann make out of sausage will keep louis busy spend -PRON- for a long while especially if -PRON- always hire somebody else to run the business 
of course -PRON- didnot live down to -PRON- idiotic philosophy 
if -PRON- have never have accept -PRON- invitation for that winter cruise around the west indie 
as i say before i could afford to argue with -PRON- quite heatedly but -PRON- wasnot -PRON- place to tell hint where to take -PRON- yacht 
but when -PRON- drop a light anchor half a mile off what look like a big ash heap or coal dump with a fringe of unhealthy palm around -PRON- have sail four day from as sunkisse and amusementprovide a little harbor as ever lure other yachtsman like -PRON- i be ready to get down to personality 
-PRON- be probably the last yachting trip ever have 
then have order the tender lower -PRON- come up and slam -PRON- on the back remark some thing worth be rich for after all eh 
for sake what 
i demand crossly 
that dump 
but -PRON- glass havenot -PRON- use -PRON- -PRON- cry fix -PRON- own on a certain spot and keep -PRON- very steady 
i have use -PRON- for a tensecond sweep over the whole of that unsightly pile and have decide that further inspection wasnot worth the strain on -PRON- eye 
to humor -PRON- i raise -PRON- again 
-PRON- be one of many and powerful enough to make mar look like a goodsized marble 
and i happen to hit the spot at which glass be train 
instantly i perceive that that ugly little island have a beauty all -PRON- own 
-PRON- be almost halfconceale by one of the decrepit palm branch 
but i could see twothird of -PRON- face also an arm with the sleeve well above the elbow likewise a glimpse of the belt that connect -PRON- shirtwaist with one of those narrow skirt -PRON- wear before -PRON- begin to take half a yard off the bottom to make -PRON- full and finally a pair of natty white boot that actually look small 
i give the screw of the glass half a turn until -PRON- look as if -PRON- be stand about ten foot away from -PRON- and i be all for that island if i have to swim to -PRON- 
then -PRON- raise a huge pair of binocular and point -PRON- straight at -PRON- 
for an instant i drop -PRON- glass and so do louie rude to stare at a pretty girl and have -PRON- see that -PRON- be stare 
huh grunted louie 
-PRON- isnot act a bit encouraging 
-PRON- wasnot 
if ever gesticulation bid one to depart full speed ahead or astern immediately if not sooner and to keep on depart -PRON- be give -PRON- the high sign to get scarce 
but louie mutter i never be any good at read signal 
i think -PRON- would better go over and make sure of what -PRON- mean 
hey pete be that ladder down 
all ready sir pete respond 
come on harry louie invite -PRON- 
and i go a lot rather have go by -PRON- have give a year salary as a wireless operator on yacht to have fifteen minute alone with that young lady ashore in which to inform -PRON- that louie look intelligent only because teach -PRON- about half of what i know that -PRON- wasnot a really tiptop overgrow boy but a halfwitted boob and that any money -PRON- display -PRON- have obtain by steal from -PRON- enough to outfit a small gunboat and rob a belgian relief ship 
but the motor tender be a lot the fast thing that could get -PRON- across the shallow to that shore 
so i get aboard -PRON- and reflect glumly that the idiot hadnot sense enough to leave -PRON- ashore that -PRON- just take -PRON- for grant that a real girl like that would never see -PRON- brain over -PRON- little pile of gold 
for most of the last half mile of that run i raise a faint hope that the tender would hit something that would rip half -PRON- bottom out 
i could swim a good bit faster if not quite so far as louie 
i keep up the hope until -PRON- be less than a hundred yard from shore and could have talk to the girl if -PRON- hadnot be hold -PRON- finger to -PRON- lip in a fashion that would have enforce silence on a class of boy at a baseball game 
then i reverse -PRON- hope so suddenly that -PRON- jar -PRON- whole system 
-PRON- have hit something 
tom healy at the engine reverse -PRON- as suddenly as i have reverse -PRON- hope apparatus 
nor -PRON- nor billy nock at the wheel nor louie nor i have ever see a mine of any kind before 
but -PRON- know -PRON- be see one now 
as i look back on -PRON- -PRON- wasnot a very big mine 
but if the whole world ever look as big to -PRON- as that mine do just then afraid get worldly 
for some reason -PRON- didnot go off that time 
but healy be so scared -PRON- forget to shift the clutch ahead again until -PRON- be back up and then the clutch bind and the engine stall 
and billy nock be so rattle -PRON- forget to steer backward so that -PRON- just set sternforemost for that round head of steel 
back back at that steel can of sudden and unpremeditated death 
the girl give a shriek of terror that make -PRON- startled stomachpit sink a mile or so 
-PRON- completely drive from -PRON- head the plan i have suddenly form and be rise to execute a dive over the opposite side 
-PRON- make hand slip from the crank and drop -PRON- full length in the forward cockpit 
i never shall know what -PRON- do to billy nock 
for i be watch with fascinated horror the movement of louie who be leap over the stem deck and stick -PRON- foot out to push the mine and -PRON- apart before -PRON- make another more violent bump than the bare shave -PRON- have accomplish the first time 
-PRON- may be the height of presence of mind -PRON- may be just a little the bad thing in the world to do 
louie didnot know i didnot know nobody know 
-PRON- just wait and wait and boom 
as i topple off the cockpit seat i see louie drop overboard 
that be all i can account for 
and then just before i pass away there come another boom a trifle muffle so that -PRON- didnot sound much too large for the general blowup of creation 
i donot really believe i faint or lose consciousness 
-PRON- first impression tend to confirm the old adage that marriage be make in heaven 
for there right before -PRON- eye stand the wonderful girl though -PRON- have never even be introduce to each other on earth 
but -PRON- next sense be one of doubt about the heaven part of -PRON- 
-PRON- head have hit and be still rest on a corner of the hot exhaust muffler and there be nothing suggestive of heaven about that or in the remark i hear louis sputtering in the water outside the boat 
i could not imagine any one in heaven exclaim huh 
well be damn 
since -PRON- be go right on pretty vociferously make -PRON- the noisy center for the moment i get up and begin to rub the scorch back of -PRON- head preparatory to step over to the side where -PRON- clung 
then i didnot step 
i stand still and stare 
-PRON- wasnot -PRON- little mine that have blow up at all 
the less bang have evidently issue from a gun on the deck of a very businesslike little patrol launch which be now proceed deviously but with evident intent of reach yacht 
a blurry puff of blue smoke hang lazily about a hundred yard behind the launchs present position 
but about a quarter of a mile seaward from -PRON- small ship be a bank of yellow smoke that make a perfect cloud of -PRON- 
-PRON- be a mine blow up out there to hint to the captain of the yacht that -PRON- may be safe to lie still and have a talk than to attempt any swift getaway 
apparently the little tender have escape observation thus far and the owner of the yacht be suppose to be aboard 
i figure that the heavy fog which have break but fifteen minute before -PRON- arrival at the island have enable -PRON- to get in unobserved especially since -PRON- have arrive on that side of the island where there be no sign of life 
the only explanation i have ever think up for -PRON- get through the nice network of mine as -PRON- do be because yacht be one of those extreme shallowdraft affair which really have no business venture quite so far at sea at all and couldnot have hit a mine that couldnot have be in plain view of a lookout on a real steamer 
however -PRON- have happen there -PRON- be and there be the yacht between the terrifically evident mine and the perfectly obvious and leisurely selfassure patrol boat 
also there be the girl 
-PRON- recur to -PRON- mind when louie now only kneedeep in the water stop -PRON- profane sputtering and turn to -PRON- 
as -PRON- speak too look at -PRON- 
-PRON- be half hysterical over all that have happen 
-PRON- take quite a girl to look beautiful and half hysterical at the same time 
but that girl be do -PRON- perfectly 
i permit -PRON- under protection of query to gain a complete survey of -PRON- attraction 
surely those dainty hand and foot be french or spanish or something romantic though the blondness of -PRON- hair and skin proclaim that -PRON- must have come from the northern part of any of the latin country -PRON- have darkbrown eye 
i be think very fast 
if -PRON- be only french or even spanish -PRON- would be all off for louie 
heaven grant that -PRON- be not german 
for louie could get away with whatever dialect -PRON- sausagemake father have bring over with -PRON- 
but louie be try -PRON- in plain english 
pardon -PRON- but could -PRON- possibly tell -PRON- what -PRON- all mean 
i fairly ache for a je ne le comprend pas or no entiendo to 
but that fairy vision speak queen english -PRON- speak -PRON- fluently not to say gaseously and in perfect fifth avenue style above a hundred and tenth street 
i quote 
i can not bear even yet to comment -PRON- bet -PRON- crayon portrait i can tell -PRON- what -PRON- all about about a year residence on this coal dump for yous though there ainot no particular good reason for hopin -PRON- wonot be six year 
if -PRON- two tender babe have have the sense between -PRON- to take the cue i be tryin to hand -PRON- -PRON- may a make a getaway with that pretty little toy ship of yourn 
but now -PRON- may just as well let -PRON- pinch the bunch of yez instead of waitin for the guard to wake up and poke -PRON- around the beach with a bayonet 
-PRON- cn come quiet and peaceable please and the baron will listen to any other particular question that s on yer mind 
-PRON- start peaceable and quiet 
-PRON- turn to tom healy and billy nock 
yous cn come along too -PRON- invite 
and -PRON- come too 
-PRON- wasnot much over half a mile to the end of the coalheap along a wellbeaten path at -PRON- base 
then -PRON- turn along the inner side of what now show -PRON- to be almost a ring with a snug little harbor in the middle 
louie have tell -PRON- -PRON- be go into the harbor if the island prove worth look over 
-PRON- be go into -PRON- all right 
and here be building long low shack of the most temporary construction also some of the heavy concrete wall that be know as the protector of ordnance by any one who have ever be to fort wadsworth 
warp to a dock in the middle of this little harbor lie a long black ship which just about fill the capacity of the place 
-PRON- certainly would have be squeeze to put two such ship in there at once 
louie give -PRON- one gasping look 
i hand -PRON- back to -PRON- 
-PRON- both know 
-PRON- have stumble upon the hide coal station of that mysterious raider that have be make the newspaper interesting when -PRON- have last see any -PRON- could read at porto rico 
and that grim monster into which just then man be carry almost at a run huge bag of the soft black coal pile to the height of a small hill all over the island that be the raider -PRON- 
before -PRON- have go another fifteen foot a younglooke officer run down the hill to meet -PRON- 
the girl bring -PRON- to a halt 
here rudy be four of the man off that yacht out there -PRON- introduce -PRON- 
-PRON- get off in a little gasboat before captain heiny see -PRON- i reckon 
anyhow -PRON- land down at the other end 
gott 
rudy exclaim 
and -PRON- bring dem guy up here all by -PRON- already 
say mamie -PRON- could take -PRON- from -PRON- -PRON- will get one iron cross from der kaiser yet 
mamie laugh disdainfully 
not i reckon fr bringin up -PRON- boob 
-PRON- come like -PRON- be little lamb what i be leadin to pasture 
gee ought to see -PRON- 
-PRON- get mix up pretty close with one o -PRON- little bomb along the shore just about the time the friedrich fire a shot and -PRON- let go the mine the other side of the yacht 
this soak guy go clean overboard 
the other topple into the cockpit an lay still with the muffler singein -PRON- hair and neck 
and these two makebelieve sailor just lay down to die anywhere the layin be good and handy 
rudy have turn now and start back with -PRON- toward the row of shack nestle in the hollow of the great crescent of soft coal 
-PRON- bid the girl follow 
meanwhile i be make an inventory of rudy 
all tell -PRON- look good to -PRON- and -PRON- sound better 
-PRON- broken english be not the sort a german learn in school but the kind one pick up in a stay of a few year right around new york city apparently that same idea of the young officer have occur to hartmann 
say herr offizier -PRON- speak in that utterly nonchalant manner which be the similitude of -PRON- entire attitude toward everything would -PRON- mind give -PRON- some sort of steer as to what -PRON- be go to do to -PRON- for accidentally stumble on this delightful little island of yours 
i donot know herr offizier rudy reply quite seriously 
-PRON- would make a whole lot of difference for why -PRON- want to come to -PRON- delightful little island get plenty of chance to exblain that to dem herrn capitan 
whether -PRON- believe -PRON- may be something else again see 
but but louie begin 
anyhow i ainot suppose to talk with -PRON- fellow 
but say -PRON- voice drop -PRON- donot neither of -PRON- happen to come from newark do -PRON- 
why -PRON- father sausage factory be out on the meadow hastily respond hartmann 
-PRON- donot happen to know anybody by name of shiffen on sixth street number a hundert and one 
i get one sister name hilda what board there when i come away 
-PRON- and mamie here ainot never get along good -PRON- know how girl be 
so mamie donot know nothing about whether still there or alive or dead yet 
louie apologize for -PRON- utter ignorance of newark beyond -PRON- father factory save as to the main street by which motorist get through and out of that town 
-PRON- regret sound pretty genuine 
-PRON- must be devilish hard -PRON- mourn to be cut off from -PRON- relative like this 
i could have understand -PRON- regret if louie werenot half as sympathetic a big kid as -PRON- be 
i be regret a lot -PRON- and be guess whether -PRON- would be safe to assure out keeper that i know -PRON- sister hilda perfectly 
the trouble would be that if -PRON- ask any question about newark be catch bluffing 
i donot remember ever see even a picture postcard of newark 
anyhow i didnot have time to take the chance 
in another moment -PRON- have be usher into the august presence of herr lieutenant baron von hilberstein a pinkcheeke blueeye goldenhaire youth of a trifle over twenty who stand up to greet -PRON- look as if -PRON- be afraid to death of -PRON- 
-PRON- be not of -PRON- however that -PRON- be afraid 
-PRON- be of -PRON- own almost faultlessly though much too carefully pronounce english 
i trust gentleman -PRON- say when -PRON- have manage some form of general introduction -PRON- will understand -PRON- inquisitiveness from the fact that the usefulness of -PRON- station here depend entirely upon -PRON- enemy ignorance of -PRON- existence 
-PRON- will also appreciate that -PRON- be difficult for -PRON- to understand why -PRON- should have bring -PRON- yacht here from so pleasant a resort as san juan oh yes -PRON- have be the one inquire -PRON- position every few hour under different wireless name 
-PRON- even try to head -PRON- off day ago by a storm warn -PRON- do not choose to heed 
-PRON- try again this morning but could not get -PRON- 
now -PRON- see that -PRON- have pass forty or fifty more attractive island without give -PRON- a look 
-PRON- choose this of all other 
-PRON- will not mind explain why i hope 
if bad come to bad i could have explain the only reason i have ever come 
-PRON- desire to be anywhere on that island have begin when i have catch sight of that pretty girl who have turn out very disappointing thus far 
-PRON- may be an unpleasant thing to explain in the presence of the young lady -PRON- but -PRON- wasnot pleasant have that pink boy look at -PRON- as if -PRON- think -PRON- be dangerous while -PRON- have -PRON- in -PRON- power to order -PRON- blindfolded and shoot 
i have come because louie have bring -PRON- thus far 
but louie well louie falter something raise within -PRON- a creepy sensation that what -PRON- have to say didnot sound much like sense -PRON- see this island be down on the chart as uninhabited 
nobody seem to know much of anything about -PRON- except that -PRON- be on the chart 
i i get the notion -PRON- may be interesting to explore er explore the place up a little donot -PRON- know 
i -PRON- break off grow red in the face 
explore an island as small as that and already perfectly indicate on the chart -PRON- do sound weak 
i see -PRON- inquisitor break in 
some such curiosity i take -PRON- as animate -PRON- excellency expresident roosevelt to discover the river of doubt this with the mere trace of a smile under the fuzzy mustache 
louie and i both laugh nervously 
oh i i just take the notion whim i guess -PRON- may call -PRON- boyish nonchalance be all but go to piece 
i see i see 
the young officer speak as if in a hurry to let -PRON- go at that 
-PRON- be wonderfully businesslike consider -PRON- apparent age 
and no doubt -PRON- be a similar whim which lead -PRON- to come in close behind -PRON- minefield under cover of a fog at the top of the tide 
also see -PRON- have no idea about the place except that -PRON- be uninhabited beyond what the chart show -PRON- be certainly not reason but whim pure and simple which cause -PRON- to anchor -PRON- vessel outside when the chart indicate a safe harbor as the only possible advantage of the spot 
louie throw up -PRON- hand 
-PRON- grin amiably at the girl 
murder will out -PRON- cry flush 
i hope this young lady will forgive -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- turn again toward -PRON- will have to admit that -PRON- s drive -PRON- to -PRON- 
the captain get a little mixed deadreckoning in the fog and -PRON- think -PRON- be go down to the front door of -PRON- harbor all right -PRON- go on 
in fact -PRON- think -PRON- be over a mile beyond -PRON- and make a wide circuit to get the end of the channel as the chart show 
if the fog have wait another ten minute to lift i imagine -PRON- would have come very near try to climb -PRON- coal mound for -PRON- think -PRON- have half a mile more to the turn 
the first look i get at the shore give -PRON- the notion that i didnot want to land at all and i be on the point of give the order to back out and start for something more interesting when i happen to see the lady here 
the island be not uninhabite 
i credit all of -PRON- with taste enough to understand that such a sample citizen of any land would tempt one to take the short cut to some acquaintance with -PRON- 
-PRON- may have break the tension entirely but -PRON- effect do not reach that 
the boyish lieutenant blush a shade deep while -PRON- smile as if -PRON- would rebuke -PRON- for levity in so serious a moment 
only rudy seem to laugh wholeheartedly as if -PRON- have somehow tickle -PRON- personal vanity 
of course louie and i emit a sort of choke spasm of a chuckle which be more or less hysterical 
but the girl thus flatter or honor as -PRON- may choose look highly indignant and speak the nerve of -PRON- 
say just like to ask -PRON- and -PRON- turn on louie if -PRON- glass of youm be so good -PRON- could see all these bewitchin charm hang onto -PRON- if i didnot hand -PRON- as many sign to beat -PRON- as a person could hand out who didnot know the deafanddumb for scat gawd know i didnot aim to act invitin 
-PRON- certainly didnot louie admit 
but -PRON- action fail to outweigh -PRON- good look 
freshie -PRON- utter in deep scorn and stick out -PRON- tongue at hartmann in dead earnest 
whereupon the pinkface lieutenant clear -PRON- throat for action again 
this be hardly a time for jest -PRON- assert with that deep solemnity one have to use if -PRON- isnot go to give up be solemn altogether and laugh 
while i shall not take any hasty action there be plenty of time so far as i can see for full consideration of detail and consultation with the superior officer of such vessel as be supply here -PRON- must be quite patent to both of -PRON- that a much more rational hypothesis to account for -PRON- presence than the highly whimsical one -PRON- have give would be to the effect that -PRON- represent -PRON- government in have entertain some suspicion of this island and in attempt to satisfy that suspicion under guise of an innocent yachting cruise represent -PRON- government gasp louie 
why -PRON- dear erlieutenant that be preposterous 
that yacht of mine be absolutely private property no more a member of the united state army or navy than -PRON- be 
i ah coldly rejoin the lieutenant -PRON- mild blue eye grow sharp and hard perhaps there have be a mistake 
perhaps -PRON- be another louisa and another mr louis hartmann who own the yacht list as a member of the united state power squadron of new york which be number ninetysix in the practise maneuvering hold in new york bay last september 
there be time when one can get through more thinking in thirty second than -PRON- could accomplish in thirty ordinary hour of close application 
-PRON- first thought cause -PRON- to give one startled glance at louie 
i be afraid -PRON- would blow up and say thing unbecome a quasinaval officer make prisoner by a german herr baron 
if there s one thing calculate to get louie start -PRON- the united state power squadron 
-PRON- be enthusiastically in that effort to give amateur owner of pleasure vessel the proud feeling that -PRON- be practically commander in the -PRON- be in -PRON- at the start 
-PRON- have stay in -PRON- up to this extremely parlous moment 
most of the member of the be ready any minute to swear that -PRON- be ask to form -PRON- association by the authority of the navy 
there isnot any question that -PRON- form -PRON- 
-PRON- train -PRON- like anything 
those of -PRON- who be rich enough get new boat that look as warlike as a deckcleare battleship 
and then the navy didnot take -PRON- on 
-PRON- be a great disappointment 
-PRON- be bad 
-PRON- be an outrage 
-PRON- be an unspeakable act of ingratitude to the high minded patriot who have spend -PRON- and -PRON- hardinherite gold 
the thought that after all uncle unappreciative ungrateful failure to recognize -PRON- pet society -PRON- should be here actually accuse of act as a spy in danger of be summarily shoot for be a spy this thought be enough to get louie start 
-PRON- do then and there 
louie forget the lady 
-PRON- forget -PRON- own danger 
-PRON- forget everything but the raw deal suffer by the united state power squadron at the hand of the united state navy 
-PRON- surely teach that pinkcheeke lieutenant a lot of english not to be get out of any book publish while anthony comstock be alive or even since 
oh -PRON- be lucky for louie that in peace time -PRON- canot commit treason against the united state government with -PRON- mouth 
even at that i donot know as -PRON- could have get away with some of the stuff -PRON- put across except in a very close circle of friend 
and although the kaiser and woodrow wilson be just then weep on each other neck in warlike and peaceful peace note -PRON- wasnot right to give the impression that -PRON- navy could be chase out of the sea by a properly man and manage fleet of model sailboat 
louie do that as hear -PRON- do -PRON- before and -PRON- go on to pay -PRON- respect to all the other department of the government in a fashion to have make the king of siam wonder if -PRON- werenot -PRON- duty to humanity to take -PRON- in order to provide -PRON- with a government if not quite kulture at least endow with a faintly human intelligence 
if that pinkface baron wirelesse half of remark to wilhelm -PRON- no wonder the imperial government decide that no ruthless submarining could be so insane as get mix up in peace effort with the halfwitted brainsoftene seniledecaye defective louie paint for uncle sam no wonder the baron soften toward -PRON- 
-PRON- probably think -PRON- would be a shame to waste bullet on the deadly possible spy from a hostile chickenrun 
be that true herr corporal -PRON- ask of rudy 
about this here power squadron rudy respond i ainot never hear nothing in america 
i wasnot there long enough yet to be buyin -PRON- hundredthousanddollar yacht to play navy game with 
but by the time -PRON- have say this the american girl have get from the corner of the little room to which -PRON- have recede 
-PRON- have plant -PRON- squarely in front of louie 
-PRON- cheek be blaze and -PRON- brown eye have turn the color of good anthracite 
do -PRON- know anything about -PRON- vetterchen 
von hilberstein ask -PRON- 
about what -PRON- ask with the craokle of fire in a pine board 
about this power squadron 
power squadron -PRON- repeat hotly 
no cousin mine i never hear a darn thing about -PRON- till right now 
but i can guess a lot moren hear 
if this here boob a speciman of this power squadron outfit i can guess -PRON- s get the wrong steer about why -PRON- ainot recognize by the united state navy 
i can guess a lot well reason than -PRON- s give because the united state navy ainot so hard up for hospital ship as to be takin floatin bughouse already load with loonatic even at a gift because the little navy ainot and never be no asylum for feeb even though -PRON- may have the dough to buy -PRON- own floatin nursery and hire -PRON- own nurse 
an while talkin herr cousin lieutenant baron heiny von hilberstein go to tell -PRON- these here ainot no spy 
the united state ainot get no such system of spy as -PRON- dutchmen to be sendin suspicious report about what the cop of squeedunk crossin eat for -PRON- dinner mebbe but the united state when -PRON- need a spy cn afford the few cent extra to get one what could tell a arsenal from -PRON- own big mouth 
then -PRON- flash -PRON- eye back at louie hartmann 
-PRON- be already brim with angry tear 
-PRON- -PRON- an american -PRON- cry scornfully 
oh -PRON- big boob -PRON- big boob 
-PRON- -PRON- big big -PRON- break off sob hysterically to the exclusion of articulation and dash from the shack 
and i know a lot more about that little girl than dream of either when hear -PRON- sadly unclassic english or when first look upon -PRON- absurdly pretty face and think -PRON- the most beautiful woman ever see 
of course -PRON- be german german enough to be the cousin of this pinkcheeke baron the sister of corporal rudy as i guess that evening when i hear the baron call rudy vetter too and louie tell -PRON- that mean cousin german enough to be here with -PRON- kin however in the world -PRON- have get here lend all the energy and courage -PRON- have to -PRON- in a forlorn island likely at any moment to be turn into a hell of deadly danger 
but -PRON- be american too 
i could guess that this be not the first time -PRON- have give uncle sam the support of -PRON- highly colloquial eloquence 
no doubt the whole station tease -PRON- 
a lot of goodnatured and bitterly lonely soldier or sailor would be sure to tease as pretty a girl as -PRON- be 
but i imagine -PRON- have not tease -PRON- about america after the first week of -PRON- stay among -PRON- whenever that have be 
i forgave -PRON- -PRON- bad english 
although i have never count -PRON- own patriotism anything to brag about -PRON- strike -PRON- that a heart as loyal as -PRON- could be plenty of excuse for overlook the fact that the tongue tie to -PRON- talk the slang and grammar of shop and cheap tenement 
the man that win that loyal little heart would be well pay for the labor -PRON- may cost -PRON- to train the tongue to high speech would be rich in possess -PRON- even if -PRON- labor utterly fail 
be i willing to be the man for the labor or the failure even 
well i forget all about -PRON- parlous position in figure that -PRON- like american better than german and that of the two real male american present the other one have shatter -PRON- chance with the girl beyond all hope of repair 
while i be do this reflect the other be talk mostly in german 
-PRON- appear that -PRON- position be rapidly get over the bad of -PRON- parlousness 
at all event the herr lieutenant be lead -PRON- out to a shady spot under what be leave of a pair of palm for afternoon coffee and cigarette 
as -PRON- step from the shack the louisa be be tow very carefully into the tiny harbor 
the baron stop for an appraise and approve glance 
i say herr baron louie speak up in a manner that indicate the effectiveness of -PRON- normal buoyancy be there any good reason why -PRON- shouldnot remain prisoner aboard -PRON- yacht 
i be on the point of make that suggestion -PRON- mr hartmann the lieutenant respond warmly 
-PRON- really havenot any spare room for prisoner on shore here 
and may i ask if there s anything in the code to forbid -PRON- the pleasure of invite -PRON- captor and -PRON- company aboard this evening for a little dinner in honor in honor of louie break off falteringly 
des kaiser prompt the captor 
oh i say hartmann appeal to -PRON- -PRON- wouldnot ask that of -PRON- yet would -PRON- 
-PRON- know i tell -PRON- all against -PRON- in sentiment about this war 
what then honesty have almost put the skid under -PRON- painfully builtup safety and nearfriendship with the man who hold -PRON- prisoner of war 
the baron tone have turn stiff and sharp again 
well like to make -PRON- a dinner in honor of -PRON- pretty cousin and by way of a public apology from one american for insult the navy of the good little american ever that go 
baron von face relax 
-PRON- glance toward the shine smile on the face of -PRON- subordinate cousin rudy 
i guess -PRON- could stand for that -PRON- decide 
eh rudy 
the way the food be lately i could almost dine in honor of any of the ally except england 
-PRON- be after the coffee as -PRON- be be escort by rudy back to -PRON- own yacht now very securely tie to the side of the long pier at the end of which the raider still yawn for more and more bag of black dirty coal that louie tell -PRON- the outcome of the confab in the shack 
-PRON- wonot let -PRON- go mourn hartmann 
-PRON- wouldnot take -PRON- oath or -PRON- word as a gentleman or -PRON- check for half a million as security for -PRON- keep -PRON- mouth shut about this black hole 
-PRON- say the secret be too important to trust with any one here here harry until the island discover by the british or the end of the infernal war 
well i couldnot help -PRON- if -PRON- tone lack the mournfulness of -PRON- 
-PRON- may take time to win the affection of the lovely stormy little adopt american well the man next -PRON- at the table be just tell -PRON- all this stuff about be at the end of -PRON- rope be bosh 
-PRON- say the central power can keep up the fight for ten year 
louie look as if -PRON- want to bite -PRON- 
i think -PRON- call -PRON- a pacifist -PRON- snap 
i always know that be just another alias for a damn -PRON- sound as if the idea of ten year more war tickle -PRON- 
well if -PRON- should take -PRON- that long maybe -PRON- do 
if ex warden osborne ever want to get some rudimentary point on the real way to make a prison the sort of place for which an old offender will long with pang of homesickness the man to give any point the criminal friend may have overlook 
i think that next week have almost get louie resign to -PRON- gloomy prospect 
certainly -PRON- captor spare no pain to make -PRON- feel at home 
-PRON- dine with -PRON- that night and -PRON- lunch with -PRON- next day and -PRON- accept another invitation to another dinner in the evening 
-PRON- sing lively song to console -PRON- for -PRON- loneliness and grow happy over -PRON- be console until -PRON- sing the mournful song that show -PRON- be really overjoy -PRON- 
by the third night -PRON- look as if the festivity be at an end 
-PRON- have eat -PRON- out of provision 
but on the fourth day -PRON- give -PRON- generously of -PRON- own meager stock in pay and seem to love -PRON- as well as -PRON- have while -PRON- be play the host 
and that night the raider which have sail away before dawn of the day after -PRON- arrival come in with all hand singe 
-PRON- seem that the three previous trip have be lean one in the matter of secure food supply 
the ship -PRON- have catch have be inward bind near the end of -PRON- trip and of -PRON- provision 
this time fortune be kindly 
two passenger ship have be bag within an hour of leave south american port -PRON- buffet perfectly intact 
also there have be no difficulty in quickly land the passenger before -PRON- have time to raise appetite after the scare of be capture 
the raider be fairly fat with food and the stock of two firstclass and one secondclass bar 
the genial captain have not have time to acquaint -PRON- with -PRON- existence the day -PRON- come but -PRON- now send -PRON- over an invitation to dine with the officer of -PRON- vessel and the lieutenant in charge of the island station 
of course this affair start off a lot stiff than -PRON- previous dinner have inasmuch as the invite include none of the lowranke man of either ship or shore 
but -PRON- soon warm up 
the captain make -PRON- the guest of honor seat -PRON- at either side of -PRON- own plate 
the first toast propose be a long and painstakingly pronounced eulogy of the president of the united state 
i answer -PRON- with a paean of praise for the kaiser which be so warm -PRON- vote to drink -PRON- in schnapp instead of champagne 
to the toast america louie manage to reply with one to the german people and be sane enough to refrain from any hint that -PRON- think -PRON- could tell -PRON- a well way to govern -PRON- than -PRON- have 
follow toast and more toast 
then -PRON- grow less formal and get to tell -PRON- delicious yarn of -PRON- raid yarn that would have make a fortune for a storywriter 
-PRON- may have be all true or part true or mostly pure fiction but -PRON- be all good 
then -PRON- grow still less formal 
somebody get the piano go and -PRON- all sing 
somebody else start a phonograph and well -PRON- be good night then 
the partizan of the machinemade music didnot even bother to line up opposite those who hold to the piano 
each choose -PRON- song and do -PRON- good with -PRON- until -PRON- happen to go softer than the other when -PRON- would shift to the one -PRON- could hear well 
and louie and i make -PRON- getaway as gracefully as -PRON- leg would let -PRON- 
meanwhile -PRON- decide that the louisa cold storage plant be the place to keep the good of the food to be leave for the shore guard 
the next morning -PRON- be cram beyond possibility of shut -PRON- door 
-PRON- be bid to help -PRON- 
after the raider departure -PRON- deck become the messroom for the officer of the station 
another three day bring the lucky raider home again with another load of provision 
there be another night of high yet decent revel 
without raise any idea that all warprisoner be treat alike i be become quite convinced that so far as -PRON- be concern endure prison life be go to be mostly a question to be solve by the capacity of -PRON- stomach to stand up under the strain of some two and a half banquet a day -PRON- be that with the joy raise to the th power and the prison part lower to the irreducible minimum 
-PRON- be that for just one week and then -PRON- wasnot that at all 
for that week i think i be the one to catch the wth power and that multiply by several time what the rest be get out of -PRON- 
for i wasnot enjoy just food and drink and good story and song and boisterous stag dance 
i be enjoy the society of the girl 
because corporal rudy could get along pretty well in english because maybe -PRON- be the lieutenant cousin and in line for a little favoritism but still more as i figure -PRON- out because -PRON- presence provide chaperonage to afford -PRON- sister a little change from a scene that must be drive -PRON- to the verge of dementia to the comfort and the society of the bright world aboard -PRON- yacht corporal rudy be put at the head of the half dozen marine assign to keep -PRON- prison tie to the dock 
and -PRON- and the girl spend practically the whole of each day aboard with -PRON- 
and i have the girl to -PRON- 
-PRON- refuse to warm up to the man who have blacken -PRON- country navy before the officer of the navy of another country 
and since rudy and louie seem to hit -PRON- off together beautifully -PRON- require little engineering to keep the four of -PRON- pair off exactly to -PRON- liking and almost to the satisfaction of -PRON- heart desire desire well there wasnot any doubt in -PRON- mind about -PRON- heart desire before the second day sun have set i forgave -PRON- east side english forget -PRON- 
not until the end of the week do i discover the flattering fact that -PRON- be use -PRON- own style of conversation as a model wherewith to reform -PRON- own and have already begin in -PRON- more careful moment to improve on several characteristic of the model 
-PRON- be a wonder that little girl 
none i reflect but a wonder in cleverness and versatility could have so thoroughly americanize -PRON- in the brief time english indicate for -PRON- american residence 
none i be quite sure but a wonder could have get -PRON- in the depth of love to which i have fall in all but no time 
i have every conviction that i be no susceptible boy 
none but a wonder i be force to admit by the end of the fourth day could have keep -PRON- from a proposal of spontaneous combustion not to say explosion 
i know i wasnot keep that proposal down 
-PRON- be just some look in -PRON- face or quick twist in -PRON- ready wit which always save -PRON- and make -PRON- choke back the earnest love talk with a feeling that have to do -PRON- or give up the happiness of any talk at all with -PRON- 
there be moment when -PRON- look to -PRON- as if -PRON- know -PRON- be the life and animation of this sordid wretched coaldump the only influence that be save the station from be empty of man by a series of murder and suicide 
then i guess that -PRON- also perceive that -PRON- be lose -PRON- punch for -PRON- job that -PRON- must find some diversion or start the train of selfslaughter -PRON- 
i recall that -PRON- have snap up rudy unmercifully over some trifle the first morning -PRON- have come aboard 
-PRON- look to -PRON- as if -PRON- recall similar instance and decide that if -PRON- couldnot get on with -PRON- own brother any more -PRON- wouldnot be able to help the other much longer that -PRON- be time for -PRON- to get some diversion 
at such moment i be dead sure -PRON- would have much prefer that i have be a girl but be do -PRON- desperate best for -PRON- and the other with what i be 
but i be so completely fatuously in love with -PRON- that i be ready to stand for -PRON- 
i be -PRON- slave for life not sure have be able to keep away from -PRON- have -PRON- entertain the barrack with nightly imitation of -PRON- converse of the day 
in the dark of these dark moment of belief that -PRON- be make a toy of -PRON- i be still ready to declare -PRON- a dividend of happiness in the thought that tomorrow would be another day like today 
i donot think ever be so happy again in this world not sure that willingly realize again that i be utterly foolishly make with the sort of insane love that doesnot care how foolishly insane -PRON- be 
but -PRON- be happiness while -PRON- lastedit be happiness for a week 
and then if -PRON- can imagine dr jekyll deliver a nice little lecture to -PRON- church dorcas society and suddenly break off to regale -PRON- with one of mr most richly vulgar tale -PRON- can form some notion of the way the joy go out of thing aboard -PRON- yacht and that island 
-PRON- be noon dinner hour and -PRON- be lunch the raider officer in return for the second feast in which -PRON- help -PRON- celebrate the capture of two or more wellprovisioned ship 
-PRON- be all roar at a story of the captain when the wireless operator of the island station step up to lieutenant von hilberstein salute and hand over a message 
von hilberstein read -PRON- with a smile of satisfaction grow broad with each word 
-PRON- be as if only the presence of -PRON- superior prevent -PRON- from turn loose a whoop of joy 
-PRON- hand -PRON- to the grayhaired captain 
the captain read -PRON- read -PRON- again as if -PRON- be too good to believe 
and -PRON- do not try to prevent -PRON- from shout a bullthroated hurrah 
the clamor for more definite information be instant 
even as i voice -PRON- own eager what be -PRON- herr captain 
i feel a wave of hope that at last the kaiser definite peaceterm have be publish 
-PRON- be cry the captain and there be instant silence at the resonance of -PRON- voice -PRON- be that at last -PRON- real foe be to be reach 
-PRON- be that -PRON- last and sure weapon be to be wield 
-PRON- be that england be to get a taste of that emptiness -PRON- have inflict on -PRON- helpless woman and child 
-PRON- be that the soft palavering be over about rule that england have be permit to change at -PRON- own sweet will 
-PRON- be the answer to -PRON- enemy scorn for -PRON- benevolent offer of peace 
-PRON- be the end of the war 
-PRON- be victory victory at last make certain for the fatherland victory over a whole world full of enemy 
come meine jugenden 
quick wine schnapp beer anything 
-PRON- drink to -PRON- wilhelm -PRON- kaiser hoch 
hoch 
hoch 
at last -PRON- have sign the order and publish -PRON- to the world for the beginning and prosecution to the bitter end of the war of the uboat 
the glass have be fill with whatever drink each could reach handy be raise even as -PRON- speak the last word be clink joyously to punctuate the end of -PRON- fiery speech 
then suddenly the lip that have part to receive the glass fall wider open in a gasp of amaze 
above the clinking and the rise murmur of satisfaction break the voice of the girl shrill harsh fierce to the verge of fury vulgar unquestionably in -PRON- wrathful loyalty to a land that be not the home of the or theirs 
may -PRON- kaiser soul bum in hell for -PRON- 
down on the mahogany deck a dainty glass monographe with the yacht name shatter into a thousand piece and splashed water over the foot of the officer 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- a moment in blank amaze 
many a face and the captain be among -PRON- pale with rage at the unexpected insult to the high representative of all -PRON- mighty pride 
and -PRON- answer -PRON- stare for stare defiant -PRON- lip part with pant breathe -PRON- fair cheek afire -PRON- hair in the sunlight a dash of flame -PRON- eye lambent coal 
but no man capable of be the captain of that raider could have remain angry with wrath so pretty as her 
the captain let -PRON- down with a little chuckle 
perhaps -PRON- remember an inestimable service -PRON- have already render to -PRON- cause 
the other follow -PRON- example and laugh as -PRON- remark goodhumoredly enough -PRON- little lady doesnot like the uboats 
-PRON- wait an instant try to get breath for more of the sort of tirade of which -PRON- be a master 
then -PRON- wheel and go swiftly to the gangplank to the pier toward the shore 
ach vetterchen the baron call over the rail donot go away mad 
-PRON- must have learn that from rudy 
-PRON- pause just long enough to bid -PRON- higherbre cousin go whither -PRON- have just consign -PRON- emperor 
but by this time all of -PRON- have awaken to the fact that -PRON- host be more american 
-PRON- have look at -PRON- and discern that -PRON- glass be still full 
there be an awkward silence which some of -PRON- try to cover by drink the toast 
the lunch be begin again 
-PRON- captorguest be even more punctiliously considerate in every word and gesture than -PRON- have be before 
-PRON- ply -PRON- very gently with query as to the attitude of -PRON- country 
-PRON- assure -PRON- very earnestly that -PRON- ruler have no wish to offend america 
-PRON- decline to believe that the united state could longer fail to perceive the justice of -PRON- cause and -PRON- action 
but the free and easy goodfellowship be go 
-PRON- be glad when the raider again put forth to sea 
-PRON- politeness have be at such tension -PRON- be a relief to give over the effort to match -PRON- 
-PRON- storage plant be still the refrigerator for the station officer mess 
even these meal lose -PRON- spontaneity 
rudy and mamie spend the two follow day aboard the yacht as usual 
but rudy have go stolidly silent 
-PRON- no longer discuss with louie -PRON- ambitious plan for the day when -PRON- would get back to america 
as for mamie -PRON- seem as if -PRON- very beauty be fade by the hour 
-PRON- try to make conversation try to listen to -PRON- again and again -PRON- try and fail 
at length -PRON- frankly give up 
i think again i understand 
-PRON- job be do 
in the very best conceivable fashion -PRON- ha4 be mother that brood of big lonely generally gloomenshroude marine 
now -PRON- be wean from -PRON- and -PRON- be wean froiji -PRON- 
from the beginning -PRON- have strenuously assert that -PRON- love for the fatherland be second to -PRON- love for -PRON- adopt land 
-PRON- be at noon of the third day after -PRON- have learn of the new campaign when -PRON- hear of consequent action in sever relation 
the baron send the word by the messenger who have carry -PRON- to -PRON- from the wireless station 
with -PRON- -PRON- send a brief note of command to rudy 
there be also a curt note to louie which be sufficient to show -PRON- that -PRON- be now prisoner indeed of a nation unfriendly 
humph 
rudy exclaim at read -PRON- order 
so i can not be -PRON- keeper any more 
be ist los 
i guess this be louie answer turn over the copy of the radiogram 
rudy and i read -PRON- together 
humph 
rudy grunt again -PRON- rather heavy feature take on a troubled expression 
no -PRON- add reflectively dejectedly i like that not 
-PRON- be -PRON- be bad 
well louie snap i like this not 
one would think that esteem cousin of your take -PRON- as a personal insult that -PRON- government have drive -PRON- to break off relation 
again rudy and i read together 
mamie have crowd up and -PRON- part -PRON- head to let -PRON- see between -PRON- 
mr louis hartmann yacht louisa sir i regret that business and circumstance will prevent -PRON- lunching aboard -PRON- vessel today 
may i trouble -PRON- to permit -PRON- man to get from aboard the portion of the victual which i and -PRON- officer would have eat 
at -PRON- early possible convenience i shall arrange for the transfer of the supply from -PRON- storage plant that there may be no unnecessary occasion for friction between -PRON- soldier and -PRON- crew 
i trust that -PRON- will suffer no inconvenience in remain strictly aboard -PRON- vessel pende further arrangement 
in do so -PRON- will assist -PRON- in protect -PRON- person and property from any possible difficulty 
await any different instruction from -PRON- superior i shall of course take all possible mean to leave -PRON- unmolested in -PRON- present quarter and to afford -PRON- the full protection at -PRON- command 
with good wish for -PRON- comfort and wellbee i beg to sign -PRON- esteem sir most respectfully yours henry von hilberstein lieut 
-PRON- be 
rudy who first pronounce upon this document 
no doubt -PRON- understand better than -PRON- the difference between an essentially official communication and the possibility of personal intercourse 
but -PRON- still play that united state power squadron note be criticism 
i donot like that neither 
before -PRON- could quite grasp the significance of -PRON- word -PRON- turn 
well -PRON- come -PRON- relief 
i must say aufwiedersehn 
come mamie 
-PRON- go by the electric tower again 
-PRON- friendly blue eye blink as -PRON- turn to the gangplank 
once on the pier -PRON- croak a couple of command 
-PRON- six man come stiffly together 
six other man head by an officer in uniform similar to march out from the always busy shore end of the pier 
-PRON- pause salute and be salute 
rudy and -PRON- man march sternly shoreward 
the new six take up -PRON- place which divide the length of the yacht into tiny beat 
neither of -PRON- recall have see before either the new corporal or any of -PRON- little guard 
the man who come shortly after with tray on which to carry off the lunch for the officer may as well have save -PRON- scrupulous care to leave a plenty for -PRON- 
louie and i be in no mood for eat 
-PRON- be in no humor for talk 
-PRON- have nothing to talk about 
everybody in america have long since take for grant that the breaking of diplomatic relation would be almost instantly follow by hostility 
neither of -PRON- could conceive any idea as to what may be -PRON- condition or -PRON- fate as prisoner of war 
at least the idea -PRON- do conceive be so unpleasant and gloomy -PRON- could not hear -PRON- utter -PRON- 
prisoner of war -PRON- be 
neither of -PRON- give -PRON- the mad pleasure of dreaming of escape 
-PRON- have be first task to put -PRON- electric equipment out of commission 
without -PRON- -PRON- could not get an explosion from one cylinder of the powerful engine one turn of a propeller 
-PRON- problem be all beyond -PRON- power to figure even on solution 
as to whether this renew mention of the power squadron be to pave the way toward treat -PRON- as spy from a nation already make hide plan for warlike action as to whether such treatment would involve merely a continuation of a slightly close confinement than -PRON- now endure whether -PRON- would mean incarceration in dingy coop ashore while the yacht go to join the german fleet whether -PRON- would mean just back up to a wall and face a dozen rifle -PRON- could only guess 
and the guessing be nothing nice to be talk about 
about three oclock -PRON- have more visitor 
the lieutenant -PRON- lead -PRON- aboard the vessel 
the stiff formality of -PRON- morning note be now reflect in -PRON- rigid bearing 
-PRON- curtly inform -PRON- that -PRON- man be come for the supply 
-PRON- steward conduct -PRON- to the storage box 
but supply be not all -PRON- have come for 
there have be sufficient evidence of a hasty search of -PRON- vessel have take place while -PRON- be be tow from -PRON- outside anchorage to the pier in the harbor 
but the search which now proceed under the personal eye of the baron be thorough enough to have satisfy a storybook detective 
not a bag or trunk or chest or draver escape 
not a scrap of paper be leave unexamined 
and not a scrap be leave aboard the vessel 
even -PRON- light vacation literature be remove from the wall of the saloon and bear ashore 
all the captain instrument be take the paper of clearance from porto rico and elsewhere the log of all the voyage the louisa have make since -PRON- launching in the spring 
-PRON- main ccmpass be remove from the stand on the bridge together with the binnacle light 
-PRON- sailing lamp be confiscate 
the oar of -PRON- tender be toss to the pier 
even the marlinspike be take from -PRON- mast and any other deck tool which may possibly become weapon in any sort of free fight 
no doubt the baron be act within -PRON- right 
-PRON- come hold at least ground for a shadow of suspicion 
-PRON- escape could hardly mean anything else but the destruction of -PRON- post and that be of vast value to -PRON- government 
but -PRON- be hard to see such thing calmly while -PRON- be be do to -PRON- especially when the doer have make -PRON- almost an intimate chum 
even though there be occasional indication that -PRON- captor stiffness toward -PRON- be a pose that hardly soften the act which accompany the posing 
the baron man be work to remove the entire wireless equipment when -PRON- be bidden to go below for a search of person 
when that have be accomplish clear to -PRON- skin -PRON- be allow to dress again and return to the deck 
a glance about reveal what may have be the deck of a comfortable houseboat on which to loaf away a summer at a cheap resort 
-PRON- seem to have be sweep clear of almost everything that could suggest a real seagoe vessel 
most of the man be go the one who have just search -PRON- disappear up the gangway 
the baron -PRON- remain for a last word 
i hope well be able to restore all these thing to -PRON- again some day -PRON- say softly in -PRON- careful english 
-PRON- be not really intend to confiscate -PRON- permanently 
that hardly melt -PRON- heart or take the rebellion from -PRON- face 
von lip quiver a little and -PRON- eye blink as -PRON- hold out -PRON- hand toward louie who happen to be near -PRON- than i be so sorry -PRON- utter a trifle thickly afraid i havenot even make -PRON- understand that this wasnot a pleasant duty 
-PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- hand 
somehow -PRON- feel well to have -PRON- go that way 
but a more cheering sight than -PRON- somewhat relaxed back be the appearance of -PRON- pretty cousin at the end of the gangplank as -PRON- be about at the top of -PRON- 
the baron undertake to bar the way 
look here vetterchen -PRON- canot go aboard there any more -PRON- say sternly 
who say so -PRON- return impudently 
why i do -PRON- try to reply with dignity 
well just stand there a second and show -PRON- -PRON- be talk from a wrong steer -PRON- tell -PRON- 
i not only can go aboard that yacht but go 
but vetterchen -PRON- argue i canot have -PRON- discipline overridden completely like this hate to have to punish -PRON- in any way but -PRON- bet -PRON- grandma daguerreotype -PRON- would hate to make -PRON- hate -PRON- worsen a fight with a buzzsaw 
and look here -PRON- sweet cousin heiney 
-PRON- say -PRON- a lot o time save this whole outfit from windin up in a series of dutch act 
any time -PRON- want to see that little serial show start just try buttin -PRON- discipline into -PRON- goin and comin 
-PRON- get that 
-PRON- seem to get -PRON- 
-PRON- let -PRON- pass 
the pert grin have fade from -PRON- face and most of the color as -PRON- get to the deck 
i have to forego the idea that -PRON- be come especially to console -PRON- 
-PRON- address -PRON- to louie 
aboard -PRON- hurry -PRON- across the deck and then make sure none be near enough to listen to what -PRON- have to say 
look here -PRON- -PRON- snap into face -PRON- and rudy want to know if there s sand enough in -PRON- an harry here to take a long chance 
chance 
louie repeat slowly 
on what 
a chance on beatin -PRON- out of here tonight 
-PRON- and -PRON- have be do some figurin up there in the tower 
an -PRON- have get the dope out that -PRON- one in a hundred now mebbe but -PRON- wonot be one in a thousand after tonight 
that power squadron thing have get heiney and -PRON- will get some of the other harder than -PRON- 
besides tomorrow -PRON- will be a double guard put on here which wonot help none 
so make up -PRON- mind of youm without stoppin for bastin 
be -PRON- game or ainot -PRON- 
but the engine wonot go 
-PRON- elec i get all -PRON- need for -PRON- electricity hid in -PRON- clothe right now 
an i get some pill that will put -PRON- guard asleep if -PRON- can be get to take a drink apiece 
an handlin the button on the minefield 
-PRON- will mean a couple o shot from the battery mebbe but rudy say -PRON- will be a devil of a job to hit -PRON- when -PRON- get go at the speed -PRON- get a chance a lot o chance of -PRON- bein able to get over the anchored mine 
but -PRON- a heap well chance than -PRON- be likely to get again 
be -PRON- on or ainot -PRON- on both of -PRON- whisper and add a quaking i guess no guessin about -PRON- -PRON- warn again 
-PRON- get to go through -PRON- or go to hell i reckon on -PRON- decide more firmly 
then show -PRON- a stateroom where i can get some of the plug and switch out of -PRON- dainty apparel 
an get -PRON- crew line up somewhere below sos -PRON- wonot lose no time on the instruction stuff 
the tide at eleven tonight then or never for youse 
as -PRON- leave -PRON- at the top of a companionway that would take -PRON- straight to the door of -PRON- spare stateroom louie and i look up into each other face 
i be free to admit that the swiftness with which the girl have fairly shove -PRON- into this situation leave -PRON- breathless daze 
i hold out -PRON- hand to louie 
i croak weakly -PRON- echo in a gasp 
what do -PRON- mean 
be -PRON- go to back out 
no of course not go with -PRON- right to the end 
but there may not be another chance to bid each other goodby -PRON- know be a devilish good fellow to -PRON- louie 
and good lord 
if that s the way -PRON- feel about -PRON- -PRON- would better better -PRON- break off 
there wasnot anything better no matter how i feel about -PRON- 
-PRON- be war 
over nearly half the world million of man be in some such position as our at that moment unable to guess -PRON- fate unable to alter -PRON- fate -PRON- only choice between nearly certain immediate but honorable death before and utterly certain but little delayed and dishonorable death behind 
i never be so totally panickily pacifist in -PRON- life 
louie and i have blunder into this infernal situation 
that a man should deliberately walk into a recruiting station and sign -PRON- up for just such situation as this be the crowning example of human capacity for do the idiotic 
thank heaven -PRON- have little time for further reflection too vivid an imagination to figure up any more manner of death for -PRON- than the one -PRON- be set down for -PRON- eventually to encounter 
louie have go down the other companionway and i have follow dumbly 
-PRON- have the six member of -PRON- crew ready when mamie come into the narrow quarter with a bundle of small brass and steel 
the engineer seize -PRON- 
be get -PRON- into place while i talk -PRON- command 
make sure -PRON- be all there 
and just remember -PRON- hotter than this where -PRON- will be if one of -PRON- guard outside hear any tinkering 
for once an engineer manage to use wrench and screwdriver without interfere with the conversation 
meanwhile the girl shoot -PRON- brief instruction 
mostly -PRON- sum up in one phrase a preparedness that could find and do everything in the dark 
-PRON- seem as if the real work be go to be all up to the crew 
what louie and i have to do be to get back up on deck sit and chat with the girl long enough to make -PRON- appear that -PRON- time spend below have not excite -PRON- enough to signify anything suspiciously interesting afoot 
the crew have to arrange the hold and make every adjustment possible without an actual trial of the motor 
this must be do under cover of get supper 
and then -PRON- be up to -PRON- to get on such term with the guard that would come on duty at eight oclock that the offer of a few drink would be acceptable 
-PRON- the hard part 
not if -PRON- ask -PRON- 
-PRON- be all very well while the girl keep up a perfect phonographic performance of mirthful quip and loud laughter 
but when -PRON- leave about half past four with another hour of daylight leave well the next time fix to take -PRON- life and spin -PRON- on the end of one finger let the crew come up and look perfectly natural while i go down and sweat around the engine 
and then to eat a dinner please spare the tale 
at length the crew come up and make -PRON- way to the little afterdeck 
with -PRON- -PRON- carry clink bottle and heavy glass 
the night guard have come on a halfhour before 
suddenly i realize that here be the weakness of -PRON- plan or the weak of all -PRON- weakness 
successfully to drug seven man so that -PRON- will all drop to sleep at once or nearly enough so to prevent any one of -PRON- become alarm at -PRON- companion condition i wish the girl would come down to help -PRON- do -PRON- 
i wish -PRON- the more as time go on 
hope grow when a chorus of voice up at headquarters send strident chord out into the sticky air 
-PRON- must be try to console -PRON- i think for lose -PRON- 
but -PRON- singing would have -PRON- psychological effect on the seven man who cheerless -PRON- though with good cheer within arm reach must know -PRON- superior be thoroughly enjoy -PRON- 
-PRON- man take -PRON- out in loud laughter in request for schnapp or beer in a tone that could not fail to reach the audience above 
but -PRON- be an unconscionably long time before -PRON- see one of -PRON- guardian step to the edge of the pier to look down on -PRON- mirth 
tom healey try to make something of this slender opportunity 
hello up there -PRON- call goodhumoredly 
wollen trinken 
-PRON- be probably the limit of -PRON- german 
i have learn enough in the past week to catch the drift of the sour response not with the enemy of -PRON- fatherland 
oh lord groan louie in -PRON- ear 
that settle -PRON- put the bug in -PRON- ear 
once give a dutchman the idea that eat -PRON- dinner be disloyal to something -PRON- ought to be loyal to and hell starve to death 
i reckon i know 
-PRON- father but great heaven 
what be -PRON- go to do now after nine get to be move at tenthirty or miss the top of the tide 
-PRON- canot jump up there and expect to get away with a silent fight that will knock out as many of -PRON- as there be of -PRON- 
oh what a fool i be not to see this 
surely rudy never work out this part of the deal 
that girl must have be read nickel library all -PRON- life 
dope seven man all at once 
well this settle -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- turn to try to encourage though i must say i couldnot just locate the cheer stuff to use for the job 
if -PRON- plan this -PRON- can bet -PRON- last dollar -PRON- will see -PRON- through i prophesy in as nearly as possible a tone of belief in what i could not help realize be not so 
and then as if i have bring -PRON- about by speak -PRON- the girl be there 
-PRON- heart almost stop as i hear -PRON- clear voice answer the challenge of the corporal 
oh i think -PRON- boy would be lonesome so far away from the fun 
anyhow i donot feel up to batting with those bunche tonight 
who be -PRON- all here anyhow 
hello han hello gu why karl

for an instant i let -PRON- eye wander from the pair 
already the strong dose of narcotic be take -PRON- effect 
one of the man have totter 
another bending over -PRON- and try to speak give up and sprawl across -PRON- 
a third press -PRON- heavy palm to -PRON- forehead and kneel over 
a fourth how long be -PRON- go to take otto to perceive this 
i swing -PRON- gaze 
-PRON- be still dance clumsily backward from the girl 
suddenly i catch -PRON- purpose 
louie and the man in the little afterdeck have catch -PRON- already and be stand ready to catch -PRON- 
-PRON- reach the edge of the pier 
without wait to see if -PRON- would discover -PRON- danger or go and plunge off -PRON- the girl raise the heavy mug of vermodth and thrust -PRON- wine and all into -PRON- very eye 
the wait crew hardly let -PRON- boot clatter against the railing as -PRON- seize -PRON- 
billy nock not always too ready of mind be ready now with a bandanna handkerchief for -PRON- guard mouth 
quick now get -PRON- gun cut the rope quick 
the girl voice be a weak whisper as -PRON- hold -PRON- together to remind -PRON- of the need of haste 
louie and i both jump to the pier with two of the other 
the girl tremble finger snatch two of the gun from the limp hand that hold -PRON- 
but -PRON- be at the rope with carvingknive -PRON- have specially whet for -PRON- dinner roast 
in split second -PRON- be get back aboard 
i feel as if i have serve through a war already 
the hum of the starter gear come muffle from the engineroom 
i want to lie down and faint after the strain 
but i realize -PRON- be just at the beginning point 
i look about and discern that louie be but halfway down the gangplank and that mamie really have faint 
i spring to -PRON- assistance to get -PRON- aboard 
be -PRON- go with -PRON- 
i gasp have to now louie speak in a tone border on despair 
but -PRON- leave -PRON- to get the exhausted girl to a long seat where -PRON- could lie down and turn to help the man who be shove off the gangplank 
-PRON- leave -PRON- dangle down the side of the pier 
the work of bring the girl hack to consciousness keep -PRON- mind for a moment off the terrible thunder of battle that would wait but second until -PRON- be discover 
a leap to the low afterdeck procure -PRON- a bottle of whisky and i have -PRON- to -PRON- lip before the engine have back -PRON- off the pier end and -PRON- be start with a reckless jerk full speed ahead 
the touch of burn liquor on -PRON- lip bring -PRON- to 
with a frightened glance about -PRON- -PRON- sit up still pant weakly 
rudy where s rudy -PRON- gasp 
why mamie -PRON- faint and -PRON- couldnot leave -PRON- on the pier and oh that s all right go with -PRON- 
but rudy where be -PRON- only about a hundred yard off the pier as yet but -PRON- almost another hundred while tell -PRON- 
and once more i be interrupt 
a shot ring out a bullet whine above the rig 
i duck involuntarily 
oh this be all right mamie be say cheerfully 
the fun hasnot start yet 
but -PRON- have by the time -PRON- be finish with the word 
-PRON- seem suddenly as if the whole harbor have become a crackle riflepit 
the light of the pier be turn on full as when the raider be be load at night 
by now however -PRON- have get far enough away so that the arc hardly help the heavily clouded moonlight to reveal -PRON- white hull 
hoarse shout blend with the riflefire 
to this be add the heavy boom of a threeinch gun from one of the little concrete pit in the great coalpile 
that be answer doubly by a pair of -PRON- like on the opposite side of the harbor 
for an instant the startling terror of the thing have render -PRON- incapable of speech 
then the terror seem to have die out 
i couldnot believe that all this be be aim at -PRON- 
i have be try to ask the girl to let -PRON- help -PRON- below deck out of danger 
now though the phosphorescent splash dart up all around -PRON- i couldnot see any danger 
i feel as if mamie would laugh at -PRON- if i suggest -PRON- 
then the twang of a bullet from the rail within six inch of myjand serve to put -PRON- into something like proper relation with the situation 
i be no longer scared i didnot seem to be afraid save for the girl better take -PRON- below i shout in -PRON- ear 
the wicked rattle of a machinegun have join the song of death 
-PRON- may need -PRON- on the bridge -PRON- answer 
but that -PRON- thoroughly understand the nature of -PRON- danger -PRON- show by climb down from the settee instead of stand up 
-PRON- crawl forward toward the raise section that overlook the pilothouse this last being in reality the main saloon 
-PRON- reach there just in time 
a bullet flatten against the mast just behind this bridge and still carry strength to knock the captain senseless over -PRON- wheel 
-PRON- happen as -PRON- arrive head wrong anyhow the girl cry to louie rock over yonder 
-PRON- snatch the wheel and begin to help louie turn -PRON- 
get -PRON- wake up again -PRON- bid -PRON- need -PRON- unless one of -PRON- can steer by chart and compas need -PRON- louie put in neither chart nor compass leave 
this will be steer by the star and there arenot any star tonight 
oh why but i have a compass the girl exclaim 
i -PRON- there yet -PRON- laugh 
not much of one but -PRON- steer one boat down here 
-PRON- turn aside to fish -PRON- from -PRON- stocking 
be that the compass -PRON- have 
louie ask as -PRON- show -PRON- an instrument a few size large than a man watch give -PRON- two thousand dollar for that any day -PRON- want to sell 
the captain be restore as quickly as the girl have be 
i stand wonder what about a compass could make louie and the girl so oblivious to -PRON- danger as that -PRON- should offer twenty time -PRON- worth and -PRON- should refuse with death play tag with -PRON- 
in right -PRON- course -PRON- have run a little close to shore 
instantly another machinegun begin to spew -PRON- stream of lead along -PRON- 
for -PRON- have -PRON- range 
from fore to aft and back again -PRON- sweep at a height some two foot above the deck level 
-PRON- first know what effect -PRON- be take from the sharp rattle on the steel bulwark louie have put along the side of the bridge for the naval maneuver 
an instant later there be a series of dull clink that tell of plateglass cabin be puncture by bullet too swift to break -PRON- 
then the deadly stream be lead forward again toward -PRON- 
-PRON- be fascinatingly horrible an invisible knife that saw -PRON- way toward -PRON- 
again the dull snapping of glass a duller drubbing through mahogany a straight line of lambent splatter in the water beyond while the drill of bullet find nothing to stop -PRON- forward of the cabin in the rear of the spacious deck 
then a quick stab of fire as if a whitehot needle have dart through and out of the calf of -PRON- left leg bring a startled yell of pain i hardly feel 
why the devil didnot -PRON- duck snarl louie 
and i perceive that the other have flatten -PRON- against the false pilothouse behind the protection of the short steel bulwark while i have but stand and wait to be shoot tell -PRON- -PRON- can make a soldier over night 
-PRON- take training to know what be dangerous 
the captain have some of that training have manage to be in almost everything that happen in the spanishamerican war 
mamie have -PRON- because -PRON- have be absorb -PRON- from surrounding wholly military 
louie have duck properly because the captain have push -PRON- where -PRON- belong not hurt any i answer easily 
just nip the skin on -PRON- leg 
but five minute later i be take surreptitious swallow from the flask to keep -PRON- upstande until -PRON- be beyond this rain of death 
and now -PRON- be reach the mouth i have almost say nipple of the harbor 
a sharp turn make under the girl direction have put a ridge of coal between -PRON- and the interior which evidently have see -PRON- plainly enough to know -PRON- be go since -PRON- firing cease instantly where -PRON- catch the big fellow the girl utter calmly 
and dead ahead -PRON- straight out now be the grandfather of all the mine 
i hardly think -PRON- will waste that on -PRON- 
but -PRON- flash upon -PRON- that -PRON- would be more apt to use everything -PRON- have on -PRON- than on an attack vessel 
for -PRON- be go away and -PRON- believe -PRON- would send back an attack fleet 
yet in spite of that -PRON- be the cannon for which i be wait when the explosion come 
the tremendous cloud of flame be totally blind 
the yacht seem to stop dead as if -PRON- have run into a stone mountain 
all four of -PRON- crash against the pilothouse 
-PRON- have bruise that would last -PRON- a long while if all or any of -PRON- last with the bruise 
and the noise of the explosion -PRON- be like nothing else i have ever hear 
for i have hear all the other noise 
hearing could not compass this 
-PRON- feel -PRON- 
-PRON- shake every fiber of -PRON- body with a shock quite distinct from that of -PRON- bump 
somehow -PRON- seize every nerve and bone and sinew 
-PRON- seem as if the whole of lifes energy have be blow out of -PRON- and leave -PRON- stand 
i hadnot strength to put the bottle of stimulant again to -PRON- lip 
and louie the imperturbable i could hear -PRON- tooth rattle together as if in a chill 
the captain hardly yet completely recover from the stunning -PRON- have get a few moment earlier sit motionless where -PRON- have fall 
the girl shake hand be lay on -PRON- shoulder in -PRON- effort to rise 
-PRON- lose -PRON- grip and i have to catch -PRON- with an effort that call for strength which have leave -PRON- 
-PRON- could not have be more than a fraction of a second but -PRON- seem a deadly hour before the engine recover from the sudden load on the propeller first in spasmodic cough then in more regular rhythm at length in -PRON- normal purr settle down to -PRON- heroic test of dependability 
be that the engine 
louie gasp faintly 
then -PRON- add -PRON- wonot run long 
that do for -PRON- not so sure argue the captain from a wide range of experience with the sensation of the sea 
that be rudy and -PRON- miss -PRON- a purpose the girl now whisper 
give -PRON- a little light aft and hell miss -PRON- some more if -PRON- donot chase -PRON- out of there too soon on account of that miss 
god hoarsely ejaculate the captain i hope -PRON- miss -PRON- a little farther next time 
another shake up like that the two sixinch gun on the opposite side of the harbor mouth speak almost at once 
-PRON- do seem as if the louisa be get more than -PRON- have ever be build to take 
once more the whole craft shiver as a shell explode directly over -PRON- stem 
-PRON- forget the scattering bit of steel in -PRON- effort to cling fast to the railing and stanchion 
the automatic pump be start louis hartmann remark a moment later 
since -PRON- would not run until there be water for -PRON- to take -PRON- running now show that the terrific shock have open seam 
-PRON- didnot need any ballast for get over what s ahead 
then -PRON- seem as if -PRON- all settle into a sort of apathy that no longer care what become of -PRON- 
the next attempt of the large gun to find -PRON- range be total failure 
somehow -PRON- very noise seem to have weaken 
a second mine explode a couple of hundred foot to the right of -PRON- course 
i doubt if any of -PRON- bat a strained eye 
-PRON- know that -PRON- be draw deep than when -PRON- have first approach the island -PRON- be make no attempt to dodge those mine -PRON- may set off by contact 
there be no means by which -PRON- could have dodge -PRON- 
two more of the mine under electric control from shore blow up 
i doubt if one of -PRON- note the relative position of -PRON- explosion and -PRON- boat 
-PRON- just wait to see which second would bring death and wait more second indifferent whether -PRON- bring death or no 
well come from the captain lip in a voice that rattle across cord half paralyze be a good ten mile off shore and out of the way of the mine 
the patrol boat -PRON- say wonot be back around before twelve well find out what -PRON- can as to what shape be in for get back to key west 
and the engineer ought to have a chance to give the machine the onceover before -PRON- start any racing again 
not a word or sigh of relief from any one that -PRON- bad danger be over just a reminder that -PRON- work may be momentarily change to advantage 
none of -PRON- feel any relief 
-PRON- be just numb 
well put in the girl -PRON- get to wait for rudy and -PRON- now anyhow 
rudy 
louie and i gasp together 
how do -PRON- mean 
-PRON- donot suppose be here if -PRON- wasnot cornin die snort 
come 
how 
the motor tender be layinin a little creek on the back of the island ever since -PRON- two fall ashore off -PRON- 
rudy and willie and adolf -PRON- be all come in -PRON- 
louie and i look at each other in surprise 
then -PRON- quit -PRON- 
-PRON- didnot really care enough whether -PRON- take rudy and willie and adolf or not to be surprised about -PRON- 
louie have make -PRON- a point to maintain a crew of united state citizen that there be no possibility of trouble or delay with any of the foreign warvessel so generously sprinkle along -PRON- coast 
rudy and and the other two be german 
an ally cruiser may make demand upon -PRON- for -PRON- surrender as war prisoner 
-PRON- didnot care 
the engineer below decide that the engine be still ready to turn up -PRON- allot number of revolution per minute 
one of the clutch be be tighten 
the leak be gain just a trifle on the automatic pump 
but bar heavy storm -PRON- ought to keep afloat as -PRON- be straight to new york if -PRON- so desire 
-PRON- didnot 
key west would do -PRON- 
but -PRON- didnot care wher -PRON- go or how -PRON- get there 
and then -PRON- have to begin care all over 
from somewhere behind the island now quite invisible in the drk and halfmist a long shaft of light stretch -PRON- toward the west lift describe half a circle and dip to the east come back drop vanish flash hither and yonder and finally reveal -PRON- source in a white point of tense light now clear of the island 
the patrol boat mamie whisper 
then a sudden idea flash into -PRON- brain and whirl -PRON- query upon louie how fast cn that little tender o youm travel 
about twelve mile an hour louie respond 
for an instant -PRON- have turn on such light as -PRON- need now -PRON- stare at hartmann as if the thing -PRON- announce be too monstrous to believe 
then -PRON- arise and swiftly cross to where -PRON- get an unobstructed view of the performance of the patrol searchlight 
-PRON- drop into a deckchair there so weakly that i be not sure -PRON- have not faint 
i set -PRON- numbed muscle into motion to follow -PRON- and give any aid i could 
when i could see -PRON- face -PRON- whole figure seem to have collapse into a huddle of misery from which only the dark eye emit the slight ray of life 
if -PRON- would just turn that light off -PRON- shine in -PRON- eye -PRON- respond to -PRON- offer of help 
with the light turn out -PRON- draw -PRON- into a yet more shrivel and forlorn heap 
-PRON- continue to stare fixedly at the ever shift searchray 
huddle as -PRON- be -PRON- look cold 
i hurry below and return with a rug which i adjust over -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- make no effort to help or hinder -PRON- 
but nevertheless perform the little act of protection warm -PRON- love to the verge of flame 
an hour ago i have indeed revive -PRON- from a faint but now i have time to be and to feel tender in what i do 
-PRON- be a sentiment -PRON- tense spirit have give -PRON- no previous opportunity to indulge 
-PRON- be the sentiment every man like best to indulge toward the woman -PRON- love 
i lay -PRON- hand over the tiny cold one -PRON- rest on the side of -PRON- chair while -PRON- shoulder and face hunch forward to watch for the beginning of the next race for life 
-PRON- have always the chance that -PRON- can come straight while the gunboat be dodge the mine i break the silence once to suggest 
there be plenty of straight course out from the island for that boat -PRON- correct dishearteningly 
and the race be more disheartening 
the weather have clear a little enough so that -PRON- could discern the white hull of the little tender the instant the searchlight locate -PRON- 
the tender be about four mile off shore then the gunboat quite close in 
but one could have figure the race from the start 
the patrol have twice the speed of the tender 
that the three man in the tender make any run at all could but be account for by deliberate intention to be take dead rather than alive 
from the very bottom of -PRON- heart i wish that rudy have be satisfied to fight on for -PRON- own country 
the tender be not much more than halfway to -PRON- when the forward twoinch gun of the patrol boat open fire 
that do not deter the man in the tender at all 
-PRON- keep on with -PRON- flight 
-PRON- could see -PRON- silhouette now outline in the broken reflection of the big lamp behind -PRON- 
two crouch low and close to the little engine the third forward crouch over the wheel 
i hate to try to imagine what -PRON- grim face must look like 
the big of the gun speak again 
a splinter shoot upward from the stem of the tender and the three crouched low 
at the third round a plank be shiver for half -PRON- length 
but now the race be too nearly over for further flight 
the desperate man in the tender without diminish speed face behind -PRON- and gun to shoulder begin to pump bullet at the glare lamp 
-PRON- be a clever stroke 
the light vanish at the first feeble volley from the three gun 
though the white of the boat may be near enough for a target the man -PRON- could no longer be see by the pursuer 
of boat or man -PRON- could see nothing at all 
all the while -PRON- course have be almost athwart that of the oncoming craft 
now -PRON- have cross -PRON- line and the captain telegraph have buzz the signal below for threequarter speed ahead 
for -PRON- must not get in range of the patrol twoincher 
of all three boat -PRON- must be the most visible for -PRON- must make -PRON- possible for rudy and -PRON- two companion to see -PRON- so long as there be a chance of -PRON- reach -PRON- 
a few moment more of wait ensue 
then the gun of the patrol vessel speak sharply 
the flash seem turn a trifle to orte side 
in this last darkness the girl have get up and go silently to the rail 
-PRON- glimpse a pale light apparently show through the open door of the deckhouse and indicate that the patrolboat have turn sharp in -PRON- course 
while i be try again to focus -PRON- eye on the spot the end come 
-PRON- be one more flare of horrible flame one more detonation that torture the ear 
and in that flare both boat be plainly visible -PRON- bow almost together and raise high into the air -PRON- frame and side seem to collapse in shapeless masse 
there be great ugly howl of man in pain unspeakable then silence 
i steady the girl back into the seat once more wrap -PRON- in the big rug then sit beside -PRON- 
i lay -PRON- hand comfortingly upon the cold little one on -PRON- chair arm 
but this time -PRON- seem conscious of the gesture and draw -PRON- hand away and for a while sit stare at -PRON- uneasily 
the captain touch -PRON- shoulder 
mr hartmann want to speak to -PRON- -PRON- announce almost gruffly 
-PRON- take -PRON- chair as i head for the bridge 
well what be -PRON- 
i ask dully just this harry 
i want -PRON- to let that poor girl alone not to bother -PRON- with any more of -PRON- damned nice attention to keep out of -PRON- way at all event while -PRON- s aboard -PRON- yacht 
i be almost too astonished for word 
when -PRON- come -PRON- astonishment have turn mostly to anger 
i donot know what -PRON- mean i snap not aware of annoy any one with unwanted attention 
i could imagine something of what a blow that out there be to -PRON- 
i want to do anything i could for -PRON- 
and what in the devil do -PRON- think -PRON- can do for grief like her come back from -PRON- old chums lip get a wonderful respect for -PRON- imagination -PRON- seem to -PRON- 
i suppose -PRON- imagine -PRON- love -PRON- none of -PRON- business if say -PRON- cut -PRON- off havenot -PRON- really ever hear of the way -PRON- come to be down here in the first place 
why why no 
i donot think -PRON- have tell -PRON- i confess 
well tell -PRON- 
rudy and those other two there be six of -PRON- at the start get wind of the existence of this coaling station somewhere down here 
all of -PRON- be reserve man of course 
-PRON- hadnot much money but -PRON- have a whole lot of patriotism that wasnot get the slight exercise up in the united state 
so -PRON- concoct the fool scheme to sail down the key from florida in a rickety old catboat with a kicker in -PRON- 
that wouldnot have be any bad than lot of other thing only mamie wouldnot let rudy come unless -PRON- would bring -PRON- along and -PRON- be still loony enough about the thing to bring -PRON- in order to get here -PRON- 
and even that may not have be so bad in fact -PRON- have be see -PRON- work out very nicely in the end 
but something go wrong with the engine of the catboat just when there be a tenday calm for which -PRON- would be too low in fund to provide against with decent ration for the two day -PRON- would figure for the run -PRON- be make 
and well not go to go into detail right now i havenot time 
-PRON- get ashore finally 
-PRON- be rudy that manage to sail the boat into some sort of port 
and two of the man be dead three more and the girl be in a delirium of starvation 
and the folk that get -PRON- out of -PRON- boat make a queer discovery 
the girl still have plenty of food 
-PRON- have -PRON- tuck in a little bag -PRON- carry on -PRON- lap 
-PRON- be -PRON- food too -PRON- portion of the ration -PRON- dole -PRON- out when the bunch begin to realize -PRON- plight 
and somehow by one lie one time and another lie another time -PRON- have keep rudy eat something enough to hold soul and body and brain together right along 
and -PRON- hadnot known that shed go without -PRON- to accomplish -PRON- 
do -PRON- think -PRON- have get anything to console that sort of a love with -PRON- think there s a time somewhere when -PRON- cheap flirtation be a bit out of place 
flirtation 
i echo indignantly 
after all -PRON- have but add a capsheaf to -PRON- own estimate of the girl 
maybe something of an ass but mean to marry that girl if anything could ever induce -PRON- to take -PRON- 
marry -PRON- jaw drop 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- in blank noncomprehension 
well maybe -PRON- could now 
but before now 
why what do -PRON- mean 
well i donot know as let -PRON- stop -PRON- pretty sure i wouldnot want to let -PRON- baron lieutenant chap back there take -PRON- away from -PRON- 
and i donot see why -PRON- brother should seriously object to -PRON- if -PRON- didnot 
brother 
who 
louie insist crazily 
-PRON- god 
-PRON- didnot think rudy be -PRON- brother do -PRON- 
and before -PRON- bewilder brain could even then grasp the truth -PRON- be bear in upon -PRON- in the tone of a woman voice 
-PRON- be a voice dead and hollow with long vigil and strain and anxiety hoarse and weak and thin 
the girl be at the rail again as -PRON- cry ut -PRON- finger point toward something none of -PRON- could as yet see or hear 
rudy 
rudy 
-PRON- be a voice to call a man back from the dead 
and the cheerfullooking rather overenthusiastic and distinctly sensationlove young man who be swim toward the light of -PRON- boat be -PRON- husband 
well -PRON- speak simply as -PRON- get -PRON- aboard i guess now i get to fight for -PRON- new country bif joseph 
iver lawrence return to -PRON- home in new york after seven year devote to -PRON- education in england 
the period be and -PRON- be strongly tory in -PRON- sympathy so that when dale kirby decline to drink a toast to king george there be trouble at once and a duel 
but david discharge -PRON- pistol into the ground and thereby placate the friend of -PRON- cousin godfrey with whom and the latter wife caroline -PRON- have take up -PRON- residence 
but on the arrival of a courier with news of the outburst of the liberty man at lexington there be such excitement in the new york colony that david decide to betake -PRON- to the home of nathaniel winnington a wellknown tory whose daughter jessica -PRON- have recently meet and for whose safety -PRON- be troubled 
thing quiet down after a bit and -PRON- return to the wall street house which however in the course of the next year revert to -PRON- cousin godfrey when david decline to subscribe to the patriot pledge put up to -PRON- by general lee 
-PRON- be proscribed and go out into the suburb to live with the murray at incleberg whither after a skirmish -PRON- patriot friend adrian ingold betake -PRON- for refuge 
david insist on see the wounded man back to the continental line and in do so get a safeconduct pass from the british commander sir henry clinton 
this however work to -PRON- undoing when next day -PRON- be capture by the american 
a adrian suggestion the scout party conduct david to the american headquarters on harlem height 
the two horse of the fall british trooper be catch and ingold mount one and ride away down the valley to look for -PRON- own command 
the other horse be give to the prisoner and as the battle on the height be grow in violence and spread toward the valley the party head for the opposite height at a good pace 
on top of the rocky elevation north of the valley know as point of rock david see a group of mount officer one of -PRON- be particularly conspicuous by -PRON- superior height and by the milky whiteness of -PRON- charger 
general washington i believe say david casually to the captain who ride at -PRON- side 
ask -PRON- no question sir be the answer an not have to offend -PRON- with ungracious reply 
david nod understandingly and keep silent for the rest of the ride 
but -PRON- view with interest the hastily throw this story begin in the march argosy argosy up fortification on the successive elevation of the height and when -PRON- captor halt on a knoll to observe the valley -PRON- have quit -PRON- be permit to look for -PRON- smoke cloud now obscure the hollow way to a large extent but body of troop be move rapidly in huge patch of kaleidoscopic color and -PRON- take but a moment to determine that the rebel be once again in retreat 
the heavy firing cease little by little and the smoke clear and presently a fanfare of british bugle rang out from the middle of the valley in a notably tuneful call that -PRON- be sound captain ask one of the virginian 
why damn -PRON- insolence mutter the captain dejectedly -PRON- no military call -PRON- the call at the close of the hunt 
-PRON- think -PRON- have bag -PRON- fox but well show -PRON- yet 
-PRON- scowl angrily as -PRON- see a suspicion of a smile on face and at -PRON- surly command the party turn about and continue the ride at a swinging trot 
as the captive have vaguely surmise -PRON- destination be the morris mansion which be now the center of the rebel camp with the beautiful lawn clutter with light ordnance supply wagon and nondescript camp paraphernalia 
-PRON- trot into the yard pass around the house to the large barn and dismount 
a guard officer come from the barn and receive the virginia captain report 
-PRON- be inform of the circumstance of the capture and -PRON- read the pass that be evidently so incriminate and order a soldier to conduct the prisoner to an improvised cell in the large barn 
the cell be a room some ten foot square which have evidently be use as a small granary 
there be a keg in one comer for the prisoner to sit on and before -PRON- have be there many minute a soldier come in and place a jug of water on the floor 
then david be leave to -PRON- peculiar reflection for several hour 
-PRON- be not pleasant nor yet notably melancholy for -PRON- could hardly take the situation as gravely serious 
if -PRON- have to spend a long time in such a prison -PRON- would sorely miss -PRON- luxurious quarter at incleberg but -PRON- feel that -PRON- incarceration could not extend over many day 
the true and softhearted adrian would get -PRON- out by hook or crook before -PRON- be subject to any positive hardship and the chance seem strong that -PRON- friend would not permit -PRON- to pass a single night in such a place 
-PRON- hear many sound of excursion and alarm outside the barn 
body of horse and foot pass along the road and after one burst of shouting and trumpet call -PRON- make out that horse be hastily attach to the light artillery piece in the yard and drive away at a great pace 
about noon as -PRON- figure the time a continuous and aweinspire din be bear across the hill 
the rattle of musketry become a steady tattoo and be punctuate by jar salvos of artillery fire 
-PRON- listen with eager interest but as the apparently considerable engagement continue without abatement -PRON- become vaguely anxious 
-PRON- seem highly probable that the rebel would be annihilate or put to rout and -PRON- scarcely relish the idea of be rescue by man of -PRON- own political sympathy at a time when -PRON- may find explanation difficult 
if the cavalry patrol that have pursue -PRON- return to headquarters and describe -PRON- accurately -PRON- may fare bad among -PRON- friend than with the enemy 
for an hour or more the battle thunder roll without intermission then -PRON- fluctuate grow fainter in the distance or loud with probable shifting of position 
at last -PRON- subside gradually and cease 
-PRON- hear man cheer near the barn and gallop horseman shriek out tiding of victory as -PRON- approach 
-PRON- be incredible the listener think yet -PRON- seem to be true 
then come another fanfare of trumpet somewhere on the height and fresh burst of cheer 
the rebel be reply in kind to the british taunt of the morning the bugler be sound the victorious call of the fox chase 
after an hour of bustle and hilarious confusion about the place -PRON- hear horse enter the yard and the name of washington be roar out by a hundred hoarse voice 
david sit down on -PRON- keg and shake -PRON- head in puzzle bewilderment 
-PRON- be too preposterous for belief but of a certainty there have be a great battle and -PRON- seem that general washington have win the day 
a soldier come into the cell as darkness fall and put down a piece of bread and a jug of fresh water 
i have hear sound of great rejoice david say to -PRON- quietly 
do -PRON- troop succeed very brilliantly today 
the soldier grin but leer at the prisoner with a contemptuous air 
the king man will not stop run this fortnight thinking -PRON- say 
certain -PRON- be -PRON- wonot come this way soon again 
david be eager for more detailed information but the man turn about abruptly and leave -PRON- alone again 
the bread be dry but david be hungry and -PRON- eat -PRON- all wash down with hearty draft of the cool water 
-PRON- grow dark and -PRON- have no light 
-PRON- be cramp from sit so long on the keg and when -PRON- seem that -PRON- be to have no bed fir blanket -PRON- take off -PRON- fullskirted coat spread -PRON- on the dusty floor and stretch -PRON- wearily upon -PRON- 
a little later come a more considerate visitor 
-PRON- be the captain who have take -PRON- prisoner and -PRON- bring a small candlelantern a coarse blanket and a porringer of stewed bean 
here mr treve -PRON- say not unkindly commander of the guard for the night and no wish that -PRON- prisoner should suffer 
-PRON- can be a bit thankful to -PRON- excellency too for -PRON- s in high good humor ever the victory and -PRON- s give order that all prisoner shall be treat kindly even spy 
i shall try to prove to -PRON- satisfaction that far from be the latter captain return the prisoner 
the officer smile but shake -PRON- head 
i wish -PRON- luck sir -PRON- say but not be in -PRON- shoe for anything i can think on appear before the court martial tomorrow i believe and the the execution of the sentence be usually carry out the same day 
come -PRON- be rather gloomy for a night visitor 
david exclaim half facetiously 
i should dislike to think that tomorrow would end for -PRON- before sunset 
i canot think that such a desperate enemy to -PRON- cause 
the one little paper that i find on -PRON- convict -PRON- sir say the officer soberly 
i donot see what could save -PRON- short of a bless miracle 
to -PRON- surprise david almost smile 
-PRON- be think of the faithful adrian as a blessed miracle and -PRON- mind be not disturb by misgiving or by the gloomy prediction of -PRON- jailer 
come come captain say david donot let -PRON- plight cast a gloom over -PRON- an optimist by nature and i shall not give up hope until i feel the noose 
as a loyal subject of king george i really should be most deject over the ill fortune to -PRON- arm today 
believe -PRON- i canot comprehend -PRON- 
i think that sir william have strike at last with an army that could do no less than overwhelm -PRON- 
the captain eye sparkle in the lanternlight 
-PRON- will take more than mere number to overwhelm -PRON- mr treve -PRON- say 
-PRON- crow too early in the day and -PRON- pay dearly for -PRON- 
the height around bloomingdale be litter with redcoat tonight poor fellow that will never fight again 
-PRON- fight -PRON- for two hour run hand to hand sir in a buckwheat field just above the hudson river bank and then -PRON- chase -PRON- back in the city tonight and -PRON- wonot come out again tomorrow nor the nex day 
-PRON- wasnot a cheap victory for -PRON- though -PRON- continue more soberly 
-PRON- lose some fine fellow although -PRON- loss be mere nothing compare to -PRON- 
some of -PRON- officer say that -PRON- may not have win the fight have -PRON- not be for the rare work of colonel knowlton of the connecticut ranger and poor fellow -PRON- fall in the second assault 
major leitch of -PRON- virginia fellow go to reinforce -PRON- and -PRON- fall at the same time 
but -PRON- man go on fighting and god be thank -PRON- get the victory a terrible business declare david solemnly 
ah -PRON- may well say so return the captain 
blood and murder in a land that ought to be bloom in peace and plenty and all for that pigheade dolt that wear the british crown 
do -PRON- mind that officer that -PRON- save from the redcoat cavalrymen this morning just before -PRON- capture -PRON- sir 
very well indeed answer david coolly 
-PRON- be from -PRON- own colony of virginia major ingold as true a man as ever i know go on the officer and -PRON- fall sir in that accurse buckwheat field lead -PRON- man against the british bayonet 
there be an instant of tense silence 
the candle in the lantern gutter and almost flicker out 
the officer hear something like a stifle sob 
be anything the matter with -PRON- mr treve inquire the captain squint curiously through the half light 
there be no answer and the officer lean closer to -PRON- prisoner 
egad -PRON- exclaim quite unnerved -PRON- sir 
but i vow -PRON- emotion do -PRON- credit 
i suppose these thing sound more terrible to a civilian gentleman than -PRON- do to -PRON- that be in the beastly business 
death be around -PRON- all the time and -PRON- come quick to -PRON- 
well sir leave -PRON- 
i wish -PRON- acquaintance may have be pleasanter i can see that -PRON- be a man with a heart 
david hear the door close and the key click in the lock and then -PRON- clasp -PRON- hand convulsively to -PRON- head and throw -PRON- upon the blanket at full length 
-PRON- poor poor adrian -PRON- groan in an agony of grief 
poor lad that -PRON- have to be one of the first to go 
and then suddenly -PRON- catch -PRON- breath in a gasp and sit up 
with more of amazement than horror -PRON- realize -PRON- own predicament 
-PRON- be in a fair way to be sentence to death on the morrow and there be not one man who could prove that -PRON- enter the rebel line to serve a rebel officer noon next day david treve stand in the big courtmartial room of general headquarter -PRON- have be mr famous drawingroom and hear the president of the court declare that -PRON- stand convict as a british spy 
-PRON- deportment before this board have be that of a gallant gentleman sir the officer observe and -PRON- profound sympathy go out to -PRON- 
-PRON- be not -PRON- wish to appear vindictive or brutally severe and as -PRON- may have friend with whom -PRON- would communicate i would not deprive -PRON- of sufficient time to do so 
-PRON- be the sentence of this court sir that three day hence at sunrise -PRON- shall be hang by the neck until -PRON- be dead 
the pallor of death be on face but -PRON- utter no sound -PRON- shoulder remain square to the front and -PRON- head retain -PRON- courageous poise 
if the prisoner have anything to say speak up one of the officer of the board let -PRON- speak now chest heave as -PRON- take a deep breath and -PRON- moisten -PRON- lip 
with -PRON- indulgence gentleman -PRON- begin slowly in a low voice i would ask a a very great favor a favor that may well be too great for -PRON- to grant 
-PRON- only hope lie in certain thing that i may say to one man and that man be general washington 
if -PRON- hope to win clemency sir by give up certain information with regard to the enemy say one of the officer gravely such a proposal should be make to this court not to general washington 
-PRON- misjudge -PRON- sir 
david reply in a firm tone 
i be not one to barter honor for life in such a manner 
-PRON- be -PRON- pleasure to meet -PRON- excellency on a certain occasion and what i would say to -PRON- now be a private matter between one gentleman and another 
i could say -PRON- only to general washington 
the president of the court shake -PRON- head almost sorrowfully 
such request be not uncommon mr treve -PRON- say and i fear that -PRON- would be difficult for -PRON- to gain the desire audience with the commanderinchief 
however i shall include -PRON- request in -PRON- report and if possible i will see that -PRON- come to the notice of -PRON- excellency 
-PRON- nod to the officer at the door as -PRON- finish speak and the prisoner be lead quickly from the room and conduct to -PRON- cell in the barn where -PRON- sit down on -PRON- blanket and remain for a long time in a state of dumb stupefaction 
hour pass and -PRON- think with constantly increase agony of jessica and of the few good friend who would sincerely mourn -PRON- untimely and undeserved death 
and -PRON- grief for the death of -PRON- friend do not cease 
-PRON- and adrian ingold have know each other but a few month more than a year yet -PRON- friendship have be of rare quality survive even those vital difference of thought and action which commonly serve to break the most fraternal bond 
in -PRON- extremity of anguish and emotion -PRON- permit -PRON- even to wonder if ideal have be more just and true than -PRON- 
for -PRON- -PRON- be loyal to the crown because -PRON- father have be sc before -PRON- but ancestry have be no less loyal -PRON- have live in rare old england aqd be educate in british idea and spirit but so have adrian 
-PRON- believe the colony to be indubitably the possession and dependency of britain as essentially british as the british isle but adrian have be an old man and a wise man and adrian have see the future of america all bright and glorious in the liberty and independence of a selfgoverne nation 
the slender ray of sunlight that penetrate the tiny hole that serve as a window near the top of the cell now lie horizontally in the dustladen air and the sufferer think dully that the afternoon be wane 
then as the beam of light grow more golden a soldier come and unlock the door 
come out prisoner -PRON- command order to take -PRON- before -PRON- excellency general washington 
make haste 
david spring up with a cry of hope and relief 
never fear -PRON- friend -PRON- say haste be too slow a word for -PRON- at such a moment 
-PRON- be unshaven -PRON- hair lack powder and -PRON- good black coat be crease and dusty but -PRON- enter the morris mansion again with the spring and vigor of new hope in -PRON- step and carriage 
the house be full of officer and despatch bearer be dart in and out but general washington be find sit alone in the large room on the left of the entrance 
-PRON- will wait outside the door which -PRON- may close say the commanderinchief to the soldier as -PRON- enter and then -PRON- bow gravely to david without rise and wave -PRON- courteously to a chair 
i regret that -PRON- second meeting be so inauspicious mr treve say the rebel leader quietly and with a deep note of sincerity in -PRON- voice 
i readily recall -PRON- from -PRON- name -PRON- be a friend of the gallant major ingold whose death add so greatly to -PRON- loss in yesterday engagement with the enemy 
david bow sorrowfully scarcely trust -PRON- to speak 
-PRON- will understand sir say washington that almost every man convict of espionage be incline to regard -PRON- case as exceptional and that -PRON- almost invariably crave the privilege of lay -PRON- plea before the high authority 
if i be to yield to every petition of the sort -PRON- time would suffer an appreciable curtailment 
i may say however that in deference to the memory of major ingold i have make this exception in -PRON- case 
-PRON- will oblige -PRON- by be as brief as possible mr treve 
if the interview avail -PRON- nothing -PRON- excellency say david fervently i shall leave -PRON- presence happy for this mark of -PRON- consideration 
i will be very brief sir 
i could not tell -PRON- story to other man without the danger of compromise certain innocent person but i feel that -PRON- be safe in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- then tell hurriedly in terse sentence how adrian ingold have be shelter by those distinguish tory the murray how -PRON- have be prepare for -PRON- perilous journey to the rebel line and how finally -PRON- -PRON- have go forth with -PRON- to afford support and guidance 
without pause and with a convincing earnestness -PRON- tell the story to the end then fall grimly silent 
general washington eye -PRON- with earnest intensity throughout the recital 
at the end -PRON- bow -PRON- head and be thoughtful for some minute 
the most important phase of -PRON- experience mr treve -PRON- say suddenly but kindly be those which follow -PRON- departure from the house of mr murray 
major ingold unhappily be no longer with -PRON- 
general sir henry clinton may an -PRON- would bear testimony to the incident of the pass which seem to have be somewhat irregular 
but could any one vouch for -PRON- movement from the time -PRON- leave the british outpost to the moment of -PRON- arrest 
david shake -PRON- head 
major ingold and i be alone sir until the final pursuit and skirmish -PRON- say 
washington sigh audibly 
the most unpleasant thing -PRON- have to experience in the exercise of high authority mr treve -PRON- say be the official hardening of the heart 
-PRON- own impulse -PRON- own good inclination have to be thrust aside with a ruthless hand 
david bow silently and get up 
i beg -PRON- excellency to believe -PRON- say that i be not lack in gratitude for the attention and consideration that -PRON- have show -PRON- 
mr treve say washington with deep feeling as between man and man i believe every word that -PRON- have speak 
as general washington i can believe nothing until i have see the conclusive proof 
i hope however that i may lighten -PRON- heart a little before -PRON- return to -PRON- place of confinement 
i shall give order sir postpone the execution of the court sentence to one week from this day and i shall privately make some investigation of -PRON- case if i find that such an investigation be possible 
david step to the door and bow again solemnly 
-PRON- excellency know -PRON- to be a king man -PRON- say huskily but i would like to say sir that if -PRON- come to pass that i must give up -PRON- life i shall die with no feeling of bitterness toward the commander of the army for which -PRON- good friend give -PRON- life 
i be grateful to -PRON- for that assurance sir return washington a little hoarsely 
-PRON- be -PRON- prayer mr treve that the lord of mercy will deal gently with -PRON- 
david open the door and pass out quietly but with a heart full of high emotion 
the soldierguardian grasp -PRON- arm and lead -PRON- rapidly back to the barn and into -PRON- cell 
the sunlight have now quite departed and dusk be gather but the place be in some be less gruesome less grim in -PRON- squalor than -PRON- have be before come three day after the sitting of the court martial without further incident beyond the dull routine of the improvise prison 
late in the morning david hear a coach rumble into the yard and an hour later the guard open the door of the cell and jessica winnington and -PRON- father come in 
david utter a great cry and clasp the girl in -PRON- arm and -PRON- sob convulsively with -PRON- head on -PRON- breast while nathaniel winnington choke and strove manfully to find -PRON- voice 
verily david say the old man huskily at last -PRON- never think to see -PRON- land under such a reign of terror 
david shake -PRON- head vaguely but could not speak 
-PRON- caress the soft golden hair of -PRON- betrothed and hold -PRON- close to -PRON- 
oh david -PRON- cry at last 
-PRON- must save -PRON- -PRON- dear 
-PRON- shall save -PRON- 
this this general washington as -PRON- call -PRON- send a message to -PRON- through the line by the gracious courtesy of sir henry clinton and -PRON- be permit to come here to plead for -PRON- 
david 
i have be on -PRON- knee to the man 
i have tell -PRON- in this last hour how noble -PRON- be how brave and honorable yet -PRON- know not even now if -PRON- may release -PRON- 
the monster 
-PRON- be kindly and courteous observe the temperate mr winnington 
though -PRON- condemn -PRON- -PRON- say david i shall still believe -PRON- a gallant gentleman 
would -PRON- both drive -PRON- mad wailed jessica 
the man not gallant 
if -PRON- be -PRON- would not doubt a ladys word and -PRON- would now be in the coach with -PRON- go home again david 
poor adrian exclaim david abruptly 
-PRON- have hear ah yes -PRON- cry break forth in sob again but one wo upon another 
-PRON- be the way of war remark the old man 
i mourn -PRON- poor friend and i deplore -PRON- unfortunate misguided course 
david -PRON- may remain with -PRON- but an hour sob the girl 
will -PRON- pass the time in talking of men politic 
-PRON- shall not be permit to see -PRON- again but tonight -PRON- go to sir william headquarters in the city 
-PRON- shall save -PRON- 
-PRON- shall tell this general washington what -PRON- mean to to torture one of the king loyal subject 
this be not the spanish inquisition 
-PRON- dear exclaim david i beg of -PRON- do not go to sir william howe 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- s not in a position at present to dictate to -PRON- enemy and -PRON- will surely compromise yourself and -PRON- good friend the murray 
think 
if -PRON- be know that -PRON- so much as shelter a rebel officer thereby aid -PRON- to escape through the line -PRON- estate may be confiscate -PRON- may even be throw into prison 
mr winnington -PRON- have too much discretion to permit such folly 
father will do as i say declare jessica firmly 
shall a lady sacrifice -PRON- future husband merely to save confusion to save a paltry house and garden -PRON- in -PRON- hand -PRON- lad say winnington 
poor jessica be quite beside -PRON- and no wonder 
i believe that mr murray will accompany -PRON- to call upon sir william and -PRON- shall speak to -PRON- discreetly 
-PRON- may say that -PRON- stroll through the line in the indulgence of a whim 
sir william be a genial gentleman and sure -PRON- will make representation to this mr washington and possibly arrange to exchange -PRON- for some rebel prisoner now hold within -PRON- line 
-PRON- talk on until the end of the hour and the sentinel at the door then ask the visitor to withdraw 
but -PRON- be force to repeat the request three time 
jessica scream in awful anguish at the first summon and at the last -PRON- swoon in -PRON- lover arm and be bear from the cell by -PRON- father and the soldier 
thus david be leave to an afternoon and night of black gloom and poignant grief 
-PRON- hope of the last three day be shatter 
washington have send for the only available witness and -PRON- be evident that -PRON- testimony have not greatly affect -PRON- judgment 
on sunday afternoon there come to the cell a dash young aidedecamp very smart in the elaborate uniform of a staff officer 
david be recline upon -PRON- blanket and the visitor sit down on the keg 
i be captain alexander hamilton mr treve -PRON- announce in a kindly tone and i be come to offer -PRON- the sincere compliment of -PRON- excellency general washington and -PRON- deep sympathy and regret 
i understand sir respond david quietly but the word come forth with a great sigh 
will -PRON- do -PRON- the honor captain hamilton to tender -PRON- compliment to -PRON- excellency and say to -PRON- that i do not cease to thank -PRON- for -PRON- gracious kindliness to -PRON- 
i be hardly resign to -PRON- fate but i accept -PRON- as one of the unfortufiate incident of war 
hamilton lean forward and place a hand gently on the prisoner shoulder 
faith sir -PRON- exclaim i be tell that -PRON- be a right good fellow and i believe -PRON- now 
but come mr treve -PRON- add almost jocularly -PRON- be not far from -PRON- own age and -PRON- youngster donot give up so readily -PRON- unpleasant duty to well almost to give -PRON- a deathwarrant as -PRON- be but bad man than -PRON- sir have escape from under the very noose 
war have make -PRON- and -PRON- enemy and i promise -PRON- be the first to shoot if i see -PRON- attempt to flee but oh well prisoner have escape from the most vigilant of captor 
see sir -PRON- will have -PRON- quite maudlin in -PRON- talk if -PRON- keep that long face 
i canot keep -PRON- for long in such genial company sir declare david force a sorry smile 
pray donot think that make light of -PRON- trouble hamilton add hastily 
i have bring -PRON- at -PRON- excellencys request a bible and sundry writing material 
if -PRON- require other article for -PRON- comfort or convenience -PRON- will be furnish and on leave i shall order for -PRON- a table and chair as well as a comfortable cot 
i believe -PRON- excellency do not know that -PRON- prison be so ill furnished 
the sprightly aidedecamp already know as one of favorite prolong -PRON- visit to an hour and david find -PRON- chat almost lightly with -PRON- at the end 
the call have blight -PRON- last linger hope but the virile spirit of the visitor strengthen -PRON- in fortitude and prepare -PRON- in a way for the imminent ordeal 
monday the last day be warm and sultry for late september and the heat in the cell be stifle as the prisoner spread -PRON- writing material on the small table and prepare for -PRON- final melancholy duty 
a sentinel be now station directly outside the door the deathwatch and david could hear -PRON- pant and curse the oppressive weather 
when the guard be relieve at ten oclock the new sentinel open the door 
look ye prisoner -PRON- call out order to open the door and give ye air to breathe but yere not to come near -PRON- an here to see that ye donot 
ecod have -PRON- no hotter nor this -PRON- lad wherever ye find yerself tomorrow 
david wince at the brutal jest but hold -PRON- peace and sit -PRON- down to -PRON- task 
for jessica -PRON- fill a score of page with love and heartrending message of farewell 
-PRON- bid -PRON- seek happiness in the world as soon as the first shock of parting be over and cherish -PRON- only as a tender memory of early life 
death -PRON- declare be nothing to -PRON- but the kill pain of part from -PRON- love 
-PRON- write affectionate message to the murray and to mr and mrs winnington and a rather ceremonious cousinly note to godfrey and caroline treve 
the letter be finish in the afternoon and -PRON- seal -PRON- with wax and leave -PRON- on the table 
the officer of the guard offer -PRON- the attendance of a clergyman but -PRON- ask to be leave alone to -PRON- own preparation until an hour before the dawn 
-PRON- be very quiet now around the barn and the headquarters 
the rebel army have be spread out over the country to the north to fortify the bank of the hudson and prepare for possible winter quarter at the upper end of the island 
mount orderly arrive and depart at interval but there be no more passing of wagon train or marching of troop 
as the sun go down gradually fade from the tiny window david cover -PRON- eye with -PRON- hand that -PRON- may not see the last ray disappear 
when darkness come -PRON- shake off -PRON- spell of gloom light -PRON- candle and fall to read in the bible 
-PRON- be count the galloping hour now and -PRON- most stunning shock come with midnight the beginning of -PRON- last day 
-PRON- hear the sentinel along the scatter post cry the hour in turn each one add the familiar well and -PRON- bow -PRON- head on the table and groaned 
-PRON- be the way of the world -PRON- be to die at sunrise to leave life and love and the happiness of live yet the rest of the world be cry well 
directly afterward the guard be change for the next three hour and the broad back of a new sentinel block the still open door 
another hour speed on fly foot and just after one oclock a tall fiercemustached sergeant of the guard with clank saber and bayoneted musket come through the barn and speak to the sentinel gruffly not man enough here to furnish ordlie -PRON- grumble half the guard on outpost duty tonight 
look -PRON- to run with this despatch to headquarters and be sharp about -PRON- 
-PRON- will take -PRON- an hour an -PRON- -PRON- job to take -PRON- place here till -PRON- be back 
the sentinel seem glad of the chance to go into the open air 
-PRON- take the despatch and be off directly at a dogtrot and the tall sergeant block the doorway in -PRON- place 
david fear that -PRON- would assume by superior authority a solicitous and talkative attitude but -PRON- cast no more than a sympathetic glance within and within five minute -PRON- yawn and lean -PRON- great bulk against the doorframe while -PRON- fan -PRON- with -PRON- cocked hat 
the prisoner apply -PRON- devotedly to the bible and read steadily with no thought of sleep until a strange noise bring -PRON- up with a start 
the noise be repeat and -PRON- be a sterterous hearty snore 
david lean forward vaguely agitate and peer over the flicker candle to the door 
the sergeant be prop like a dummy against the side of the opening -PRON- head be support by the muzzle of -PRON- musket and -PRON- breast and -PRON- be snooze like a man utterly free from care and responsibility 
instantly like a flash of inspiration come back the word of the debonair captain hamilton bad man than -PRON- sir have escape from under the very noose from the most vigilant of captor 
and here be of all thing the least vigilant of captor 
david stand for a moment poise on -PRON- toe breathe hard with excitement 
but the opportunity be too rare too to be trifle with and -PRON- wait not another second 
a bullet from one of the sentinel outside may end -PRON- but -PRON- would be a happy end compare to that which be impend 
-PRON- catch up -PRON- blanket and wrap -PRON- like a cloak about -PRON- to cover -PRON- telltale skirt coat and -PRON- kneebuckle then -PRON- creep forward never breathe and slip with infinite caution through the narrow space between the sergeant big body and the opposite side of the doorframe 
the sergeant snore like a peacefully slumbering ogre 
poor fellow thought david 
this work may cost -PRON- tii life but -PRON- war 
war 
-PRON- stand free in the broad passageway and see the blackness of the still autumn night beyond the great barn dopr 
three noiseless stride and -PRON- be in the open air 
-PRON- almost cry out in -PRON- wild joy 
a lantern burn on the porch of the mansion but -PRON- be the only liglit to be see 
southward be the only way that offer sure liberty and -PRON- go boldly forward toward the main gate but reconnoiter as -PRON- approach -PRON- 
the light on the porch throw feeble ray just beyond the gate and -PRON- show -PRON- a slim rather statuesque sentinel lean against a tree at the roadside swinge -PRON- musket idly in -PRON- left hand 
the man be face straight away from the gate and for a full minute -PRON- do not once turn -PRON- head 
-PRON- be another chance thrust upon the fugitive by a beneficent and smile fate 
on quiver toe -PRON- go forward 
-PRON- glide around the gatepost at the left within six foot of the statuesque watchman slip swiftly into the shadow beyond and then dart clown a grassy declivity run cautiously more freely leap out with a glad bound and fly down the slope toward the harlem river and the neutral valley 
a voice on the height bring -PRON- to a breathless halt 
-PRON- listen for a cry of alarm but a distant sentinel call out two o the clock 
a clear morning and all well 
oh god in heaven i thank thee cry david stretch -PRON- arm to the pale star well well the afternoon of 
monday the 23d of september david emerge from the small farmhouse of a dutch settler on the eastern bank of the harlem change in appearance as though by the spell of a magician of the orient 
-PRON- week growth of beard be shave lightly in patch to give -PRON- a ragged uncouth appearance -PRON- eyebrow be trim to a new angle and -PRON- dark hair free from powder be allow to straggle over -PRON- ear and forehead 
-PRON- be dress in a rough suit of butternut homespun with coarse woolen hose and clumsy woodensole shoe 
on -PRON- head flap a soft wide peasant hat and the heavy pack of a pedler round -PRON- shoulder till -PRON- look short in stature by three inch 
-PRON- have pull across the river in a skiff just before dawn and with the money leave in -PRON- pocket by -PRON- recent captor have win the heart of the dutch farmer and purchase the clothe and pedler outfit 
the farmer in winter be will not to take to the road to sell small ware and have the pack ready fill 
as a final service the dutchman row -PRON- back to the west bank of the river and david swear -PRON- to secrecy for the tenth time and go plod down the river road toward the city 
near nightfall -PRON- halt at a small roadside tavern frequent by farmer and boatman unslung -PRON- pack and sit down in the general room to a supper of porridge and hard bread 
what news from the city brother -PRON- say to a countryman on the opposite side of the table 
why the fire out -PRON- tell -PRON- be the astonishing answer but tis tell there s woful little o the town leave stand 
news indeed splutter david affect a looseness of speech from westchester an heard of no fire

david laugh boisterously at the recital but finish -PRON- meal presently and take to the road again 
as -PRON- trudge along the dark and dusty way -PRON- brain be in a whirl 
some one have save -PRON- life 
who be the tall sergeant and by whom be -PRON- send 
and again who be the slender statuesque sentinel at the gate who keep -PRON- head avert while the fugitive make good -PRON- escape 
-PRON- picture again that slim watchman who must have hear the rustle of -PRON- footstep unless -PRON- be deaf and must have see the dart shadow but for a sudden blindness 
and as -PRON- puzzle another picture shape -PRON- in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- gasp at a sudden thought 
could two man be form as nearly alike as that slim sentinel and captain alexander hamilton 
all at once -PRON- stop short and clap -PRON- hand to -PRON- forehead 
great jove -PRON- cry aloud 
could such a thing be 
the sergeant be as tall as as i be as -PRON- red face real 
do that mustache grow naturally from the lip 
and be -PRON- asleep 
by the high god -PRON- cry in fresh amazement that tall sergeant be no other live man than -PRON- tooth come together with a snap 
-PRON- be the man who save -PRON- poor life -PRON- finish humbly and -PRON- true friend forever 
for another minute -PRON- stand still in the dark road then -PRON- stride on with a heart throb with gladness and deep emotion 
the dusty mile roll away beneath -PRON- foot -PRON- come to the boston road and swing into -PRON- with joy and before -PRON- realize the distance -PRON- have cover the great house of incleberg loom before -PRON- 
-PRON- be late but that house be -PRON- destination 
-PRON- step upon the porch and tap softly at the door 
a man servant open -PRON- fearfully peer out then order -PRON- savagely away 
a happy inspiration suggest to david the old nickname that mrs murray have apply to -PRON- 
go tell -PRON- mistress mrs murray -PRON- say that a pedler name petruchio would have speech with -PRON- 
the servant close the door and david wonder if -PRON- would open again 
a minute pass and then the welcome face of the lady df the mansion look out upon -PRON- 
petruchio -PRON- exclaim wonderingly as -PRON- gaze at the uncouth figure of the pedler 
petruchio that be the tamed one this time dear lady whisper david and mrs murray utter a cry that rang through all the house and catch -PRON- in a wild embrace 
david treve be alive -PRON- scream 
alive 
alive and here 
there be a rush from the inner room and robert murray and mr winnington drag the pedler into the drawingroom with frantic joy 
jessica exclaim the masquerader inquiringly 
ill unto death with a break heart sob mrs murray but the healing will be speedy david 
then jessica be arouse from the deathlike trance into which -PRON- have lie since the previous day and bring to the drawingroom in -PRON- father arm attend by -PRON- sorrowing mother 
slowly -PRON- explain to -PRON- that the grimy pedler be -PRON- lover miraculously restore 
-PRON- listen dumbly for a while with pathetic listlessness then -PRON- keen eye penetrate the disguise and a torrent of tear break the kill tension and restore -PRON- to life and happiness 
no one sleep until david have tell -PRON- story but -PRON- leave the mystery of the two mysterious guard for -PRON- listener to solve in -PRON- own way 
next day -PRON- hear with wonder and consternation the full detail of the fire that have break out on saturday and reduce the city in many part to a ruin 
the treacherous rebel sympathizer be blame for -PRON- mr murray asserted and some of -PRON- have be put to death already by the royal troop 
but -PRON- cousin godfrey and caroline exclaim david 
truly -PRON- friend i be ashamed of -PRON- thoughtlessness but i have not think to ask -PRON- where -PRON- be and how -PRON- fare 
never fear david say mrs murray -PRON- may trust mrs caroline to protect -PRON- husband and -PRON- 
-PRON- be once more in possession of -PRON- house in wall street and in the course of event -PRON- have become professed and accredited royalist and tory 
-PRON- may well believe that i be amazed say david but of course i be highly pleased 
i be glad that -PRON- house be no longer divide against -PRON- 
what of -PRON- residence 
-PRON- say that -PRON- be there 
-PRON- house be providentially spare by the fire answer mr murray and i believe that -PRON- cousin be keep -PRON- in order for -PRON- when -PRON- hear the crush news of -PRON- impending fate 
now -PRON- will be overjoyedto know that -PRON- be safe 
later in the day david write a cordial letter to godfrey treve announce -PRON- safe return and congratulate -PRON- cousifl upon -PRON- conversion to the rank of the royalist 
-PRON- send -PRON- into the city by -PRON- faithful valet and on the follow day a letter arrive from godfrey with a postscript add by caroline indeed david -PRON- must yield to urging and visit -PRON- at once 
-PRON- will find -PRON- house in order dear cousin and -PRON- shall welcome -PRON- with great joy 
-PRON- may feel assured that -PRON- do not regret -PRON- new allegiance and -PRON- will be a rare pleasure to gather about the old table and pledge a family toast to -PRON- majesty the king cousin caroline 
david wait another day loath to leave jessica even for a few hour then -PRON- drive into the halfruined city in a postchaise to call at the wall street mansion and spend an afternoon with -PRON- relative 
trinity church be wellnigh raze to the ground and some three hundred house be level 
-PRON- be a tragic dispirit sight and -PRON- be glad to gain the shelter of -PRON- own roof and find -PRON- sound and much as -PRON- have leave -PRON- 
the welcome accord -PRON- be hearty -PRON- seem to -PRON- just a trifle too hearty 
-PRON- check -PRON- in wonder if godfrey and caroline would have mourn -PRON- sincerely 
-PRON- be ambitious people and in addition to the mansion -PRON- would have receive -PRON- money from the british fund after -PRON- death 
-PRON- banish such thought in a moment and sit down gaily to a repast such as caroline be proud to provide 
-PRON- toast the king with a real enthusiasm and then david at -PRON- request begin a recital of -PRON- strange experience 
-PRON- be interrupt presently however by the arrival of visitor but godfrey order the butler to bring -PRON- directly to the diningroom and request david to proceed 
there be a shuffling of foot in the hall and david turn to see captain gore stand on the threshold while at -PRON- back be three fully armed grenadier 
caroline utter a soft cry and flee suddenly through a side door 
captain goring say godfrey with strange sharpness in -PRON- voice this be -PRON- man 
what gasp david start back 
why david treve snap the british captain i arrest -PRON- in the king name for treason to the royal government for consort with notorious rebel and for lend aid to the rebel cause 
who dare to fasten such accusation upon -PRON- cry david livid with rage 
as a loyal subject say godfrey with a virtuous gravity of countenance i be force most unwillingly to report -PRON- duplicity to the military governor 
i have do -PRON- duty 
to be continue rasson cf paul bailey leave waverly on the afternoon freight 
the train didnot stop 
-PRON- didnot even hesitate 
but dave crasson wasnot the sort of individual to let a little thing like that interfere with -PRON- very necessary departure 
-PRON- just race -PRON- pinto along the station platform and grab the side of a car swing aboard 
-PRON- posse arrive in time to take in the performance and -PRON- fire one volley 
then see that crasson be out of range and still travel eastward -PRON- surround -PRON- bronc 
well sir -PRON- be the first time any of -PRON- have ever have the opportunity of study steamboat at close range 
so -PRON- rope -PRON- from four different angle and then look -PRON- over 
and -PRON- return -PRON- scrutiny with such utter unconcern that -PRON- all find -PRON- mighty hard to believe that this be really steamboat the fast longwind mean piece of horseflesh in seven state 
and would -PRON- believe -PRON- sheriff hazen wish that critter on the bar maybe -PRON- be because -PRON- happen to be the near outfit to waverly maybe because the foreman -PRON- truly be an easy mark 
anyhow steamboat be give a durable little corral all to -PRON- and become -PRON- star boarder 
for three day -PRON- didnot do a thing on the place but greet visitor who think -PRON- could ride the critter 
for three night -PRON- do nothing but sit up with the victim 
the day sam bransford the world champion bronco buster take -PRON- turn the bar would have make the denver round up look like a game of huckchuck 
folk come from mile around 
and when -PRON- lead steamboat out of -PRON- corral -PRON- yell like a pack of comanche 
the pinto be on -PRON- metal 
somehow -PRON- seem to know that -PRON- be to be a decisive battle and -PRON- be all -PRON- could do to get both girth cinch up 
then -PRON- let bransford ride 
that be the big part of the audience be willing and anxious enough that -PRON- should ride but the darned horse just stand up on -PRON- hind leg and start rock like a steamboat hear of that trick of -PRON- how -PRON- would get -PRON- name 
but -PRON- would never see -PRON- before rainbowe and sjunfishing have prove effective enough to unseat all previous candidate 
now however steamboat be do -PRON- darned 
after -PRON- would rock left lung over to the far side of -PRON- right -PRON- just naturally bring down -PRON- foreleg stiff duck -PRON- head and the matinee be over 
that settle -PRON- 
steamboat have make good and -PRON- all go back to the even tenor of punching cow for old man elihu martin 
elihu have a daughter miss kate and along about this time -PRON- come home from the east where -PRON- have be exchange some of the old man beef dividend for a roll of sheepskin 
dave harkness the new man drive -PRON- in from the depot at waverly and -PRON- arrive just as -PRON- jarge and appreciative audience be hit the trail for home 
of course harkness have to tell -PRON- all fibout -PRON- and harkness be some teller 
have be with the bar but two day -PRON- wasnot quite up on all the detail but -PRON- tell miss kate enough about dave crasson the outlaw and -PRON- wonderful horse to fill a dime novel 
-PRON- even take crasson s picture from the bunkhouse and show -PRON- the live likeness of the blackbearde roadagent 
then -PRON- lead -PRON- to the durable little corral and introduce -PRON- to steamboat 
i happen along at that moment -PRON- a beauty -PRON- say to -PRON- and i choke when i nod grow to despise that calicocovere dynamo and -PRON- be hard to acknowledge -PRON- good look 
but -PRON- s a maverick i tell -PRON- hating to see -PRON- lose -PRON- innocent young heart to such a critter 
dave the only man who ever ride -PRON- 
surely -PRON- donot believe that -PRON- say push a handful of grass over the picket 
well butt in harkness -PRON- didnot until -PRON- would try the critter -PRON- 
then -PRON- both gasp 
relieve -PRON- or not that long lanky bronco with the wicked rep whinny like a hungry colt and trot right up to -PRON- 
why say miss kate as -PRON- take the grass out of -PRON- hand i think -PRON- boy have be libel -PRON- 
and as -PRON- speak -PRON- reach over and rub muzzle 
and -PRON- like -PRON- 
yes sir 
the liked -PRON- 
if -PRON- hadnot keep one mean eye on -PRON- have think -PRON- be another horse 
inside of twentyfour hour steamboat and miss kate be pal 
before the week be up -PRON- be bosom companion and if -PRON- hadnot be for the old man who have deal with horse for some thirty year shed have try to ride -PRON- 
but miss kate and steamboat didnot furnish the only affair for discussion around the bar that summer 
-PRON- wasnot more than a week before all hand be talk about the way young harkness be get better acquaint with the old man sole heir 
if harkness hadnot be such a darned likable cuss -PRON- may have cause more than a little talk for the boy all look upon miss kate as the one bright star in a firmament of alkali hard work bacon and egg 
sometimes i wonder why the old man never seem to notice the way those two young soul look at each other as -PRON- talk in low tone which nobody else could hear 
but -PRON- wasnot -PRON- funeral 
i wasnot -PRON- old man 
besides the job of foreman on the bar didnot allow much time to devote to other folk affair 
i decide to keep mum 
but decision donot count when fate step in 
-PRON- happen like this 
i be at waverly do some shopping for the old man when suddenly i look up and start 
tack to the side of pete liquor emporium be a picture of jake harkness 
the wind or something have get away with the low half of -PRON- but -PRON- be harkness all right 
from the nose up the only part leave be jim harkness 
and across the top of that poster be print five thousand dollar reward 
well sir i stand and look at that picture openmouthe for ten minute until finally a stranger come along touch -PRON- on the shoulder and say do -PRON- know -PRON-

oh say and i go inside 
but -PRON- get -PRON- think see crasson s picture all over the country for the past six month 
but never before see -PRON- without the whisker 
when i get back to the bar i call jake harkness aside 
-PRON- stand right by corral 
jake say how long since -PRON- shave -PRON- whisker off 
well sir i tell -PRON- then and there if jake harkness be dave crasson -PRON- be both darn good actor 
-PRON- just simply grin and say whisker

own up 
laugh 
-PRON- could have hear -PRON- half way to the railroad but -PRON- stop as quick as -PRON- would begin 
miss kate step in between -PRON- hear -PRON- all and -PRON- eye be flash mighty prettily 
-PRON- bend -PRON- right on dave and -PRON- look -PRON- through and through 
but though -PRON- would stop laugh at -PRON- first appearance -PRON- be complete master of -PRON- 
-PRON- be more surprised than anything else 
and -PRON- wait for -PRON- to speak 
jake -PRON- say i hear what pete say to -PRON- 
what do -PRON- mean 
i donot know say jake and i figure that be a bit hasty 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- 
what do -PRON- mean -PRON- ask -PRON- eye still flash 
well say judge that i may as well own up and then apologize i see a picture of dave crasson today over at waverly 
all that be leave of -PRON- be from the nose up and miss kate believe -PRON- or not -PRON- be the image of jake here 
so when i get home i just make up -PRON- mind to ask -PRON- if by any chance -PRON- happen to be next of kin or otherwise relate to the road agent 
-PRON- mean correct miss kate that -PRON- think jake may be dave crasson -PRON- 
-PRON- question make -PRON- easy 
i nod 
again -PRON- turn to jake study -PRON- several minute and ask be -PRON- dave crasson 
-PRON- be serious now 
an accusation like mine be enough to make any one serious 
-PRON- return -PRON- gaze without a flicker as -PRON- say miss kate -PRON- name jake harkness 
i never see dave crasson and if luck with mrf i never will 
do -PRON- believe -PRON- 
-PRON- study -PRON- again before commit -PRON- 
then -PRON- nod 
yes jake -PRON- say 
i do 
then to -PRON- pete -PRON- be horrid of -PRON- to think such an awful thing of -PRON- 
i know -PRON- i answer and awfully sorry 
i stick out -PRON- hand jake grab -PRON- and the incident be close without bloodshed 
but somehow or other i couldnot get that picture of dave crasson out of -PRON- head lie awake night thinking of -PRON- and at time almost make up -PRON- mind to talk -PRON- over with the old man 
but i never do 
jake harkness prove to be too much of an asset to the bar before the summer be over -PRON- have become an absolute necessity to the outfit and when i tell the old man as much -PRON- say -PRON- would know -PRON- -PRON- for some week 
so thing drift along 
miss kate and harkness become thick and thick and before cold weather set in -PRON- be generally understand around the bar that jake be about to tak6 unto -PRON- a wife and old man martin a soninlaw 
and the boy be tickle to death 
harkness be a popular cuss 
yes sir even who still entertain a sneak notion that -PRON- have some sort of a past that wasnot in -PRON- family bible be look forward to that wedding 
then thing occur 
first a kentucky thoroughbred arrive as a sort of preliminary wedding gift from the old man to the blushing bride 
and -PRON- be some horse 
speed 
-PRON- go over the trail like a german torpedo and i ought to know 
i try -PRON- out 
and after pronounce -PRON- safe and sane jake harkness hop astride never see jake on a spirited horse before 
-PRON- be a stickler for easygaite mount the kind that donot go in for the fancy step 
but hercule how -PRON- do ride that thoroughbre 
say there wasnot a man on the place that didnot wonder how -PRON- would keep -PRON- accomplishment under cover and miss kate laugh in sheer pride 
as for -PRON- -PRON- mind revert to that tear picture of dave crasson and i look over toward corral 
-PRON- give -PRON- an idea 
jake say after -PRON- would circle the house a couple of time and then hop down -PRON- be the only man hereabouts outside the boss that s never have a try at steamboat think -PRON- could make the critter go some 
sam bransford couldnot -PRON- say easy like as -PRON- help miss kate to mount -PRON- preliminary wedding gift 
-PRON- look down at -PRON- and smile 
maybe -PRON- have thought something like mine 
maybe -PRON- be think of the story about no man but dave crasson ever ride steamboat 
anyhow -PRON- say why donot -PRON- try -PRON- jake 
what could -PRON- do 
the boy have the dynamo under saddle and out in the open before -PRON- could say daniel boone 
and jake look as if -PRON- be about to enter the electric chair step forward 
fight 
well some 
harkness start -PRON- with an indian yell and a savage slap on the flank 
up go the pinto and when -PRON- would rise to the full extent of -PRON- long hind leg -PRON- commence rock 
-PRON- be -PRON- could see jake harkness slowly succumb to the torture 
then down headforemost go steamboat aild headforemost go harkness to the turf 
i tell -PRON- i be relieve 
-PRON- didnot look like acting 
i glance at miss kate and -PRON- be relieve too 
every ounce of suspicion go out of -PRON- then and there 
and in -PRON- happiness miss kate just slap that thoroughbre across the neck and -PRON- bolt 
off go -PRON- hat one stirrup fly wild and the brute be run away 
miss kate didnot yell 
no 
-PRON- wasnot that kind of a girl 
-PRON- stick to the little english saddle and die pull on those rein with all -PRON- strength 
but -PRON- wasnot enough 
the horse have the bit between -PRON- tooth and -PRON- be boss 
yes sir and there wasnot another horse under saddle on the whole place that be none except steamboat 
and i guess -PRON- be the only one that could have catch the thoroughbred anyway 
however some of the boy beat -PRON- for the corral 
-PRON- have to do something 
and i may have go too 
but as i swing around i see something that turn -PRON- blood cold and let -PRON- say right here and now that i be darn glad to see -PRON- 
jake harkness have leap toward steamboat 
snatch up the dangling rein -PRON- go clean to the saddle without so much as touch the stirrup 
and steamboat 
-PRON- just stand rigid until jake have whisper something in -PRON- ear 
then pivot -PRON- go after that runaway like a bolt of texas lightning 
and -PRON- sure be exquisite 
a half mile up the trail go a cloud of dust which be miss kate and -PRON- preliminary wedding gift 
and when steamboat get under full headway that cloud of dust didnot seem to be do much more than just move 
harkness must have put in some slick io argosy work for when the action cease and the dust drift clear -PRON- have that thoroughbre on one side of -PRON- and miss kate on the other -PRON- arm about -PRON- and steamboat be trot back toward -PRON- as meek as -PRON- old bess 
harkness be crasson all right 
there wasnot a man on the place who didnot know -PRON- 
but say -PRON- ought to have see the boy grab -PRON- hand when -PRON- get down after handing miss kate to -PRON- 
and -PRON- ought to have see miss kate look at -PRON- when shed finally get over the scare 
when -PRON- speak -PRON- all listen 
jake -PRON- say why do -PRON- lie to pete and -PRON- that day by the corral 
because i love -PRON- -PRON- say and -PRON- seem awful stick up about -PRON- 
-PRON- see turn to -PRON- decide to go straight when i hop the freight at waverly 
but later i want to be near steamboat 
-PRON- be the only friend ever have 
i plan to get away with -PRON- and go east 
then i meet miss kate 
i couldnot leave 
but i guess -PRON- all over now 
if some of -PRON- will come along just jog over and give -PRON- up to sheriff hazen 
no -PRON- wonot neither say before i realize that -PRON- wasnot up to -PRON- to pronounce the sentence 
i notice that the boy all nod and miss kate grab right hand and say of course -PRON- wonot 
-PRON- real name jake be go to remain a secret with everybody on the bar -PRON- canot go unless -PRON- take -PRON- 
well sir jake harkness be -PRON- boss now 
the old man just sit around and smoke -PRON- pipe and play with the two little harknesse 
and when jake go into waverly on steamboat folk look at -PRON- and say harkness and dave crasson be the only man who ever ride that pinto 
and if any of -PRON- happen to be trail along -PRON- grin and think pf the day steamboat make that preliminary wedding gift look like a crippled coyote be -PRON- come to 
the youth hold -PRON- three companion enthral by what -PRON- have be say and the fire that flare in -PRON- eye 
where be -PRON- go to end -PRON- continue 
food riot have commence 
the mob begin to rule 
next bomb play will be introduce and death -PRON- throw out -PRON- hand in a prophetic gesture the result fellow -PRON- go on grow more voluble in -PRON- wildness 
why look here 
do -PRON- know that the investigation which the federal government have be conduct into the high food price have result in the verdict that the price be occasion by speculator food manipulator and that the condition be facilitate by a general car shortage and all that 
and then the commission adjourn without recommend a single remedy 
i tell -PRON- boy well never get satisfaction in this country well never rid -PRON- of high price and speculator until -PRON- take drastic measure 
hang a few of these millionaire who corner the food market and shake million into -PRON- coffer 
-PRON- pause a minute and glance through the pullman 
karby seat three chair behind the fellow meet -PRON- wild eye with an even but interested stare 
-PRON- be apparent that karby have at first be amuse then infect by the youth ardor and enthusiasm 
a magazine lie face upward across karby s knee but -PRON- have go unread for some moment 
a pretty girl in the chair diagonally opposite have also lower a book and listen 
-PRON- face have change color slightly at the wild suggestion of capital punishment for food speculator karby fleeting glance catch the expression and -PRON- vaguely wonder at -PRON- as -PRON- prepare to hear what further the youth have to expound 
-PRON- be very evident that -PRON- strong argument be about to burst forth 
-PRON- clear -PRON- throat straighten to a more commanding attitude and stretch forth -PRON- long arm as though prepare for emphatic gesticulation -PRON- own town for example 
potato sell for threefifty a bushel that s at the rate of about three cent apiece 
think of -PRON- more than -PRON- pay for lemon two year ago 
and that isnot all 
mr grime -PRON- butter man tell -PRON- the other day that -PRON- have five hundred bushel of potato in -PRON- cellar and that -PRON- have be pay a big price by some agent who come along two week ago not to sell these potato for at least three month 
these agent have go all over the country make similar overture to farmer in order to keep low the potato supply and thus permit price to be boost 
-PRON- take another breathing spell swallow and plunge into -PRON- subject again 
truxton in -PRON- own town cassius stanley truxton who say boldly that -PRON- s go to clean up a million dollar in egg 
-PRON- doesnot make any bone about -PRON- put -PRON- finger through -PRON- vest and come right out with the information that -PRON- have two hundred thousand gross of egg in cold storage gross not dozen and that -PRON- s go to hold -PRON- until the price soar and then hell sell and what -PRON- ask insolently be the public go to do about -PRON- 
do about -PRON- 
nothing of course 
what can the public do about -PRON- when the government permit such proceeding 
and -PRON- s only one of the many speculator who have corhere egg all over the united state sugar -PRON- explode go off on another tack 
for a year the speculator have be try to comer the sugar market and have at last succeed 
sugar sell at twenty cent a pound in some of -PRON- large city and the supply be so low that many house canot get a bit of -PRON- 
fine state of affair for a peaceful nation a country that isnot at actual war with anybody price high than -PRON- be in germany in england 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- be pay right now for potato in toronto and -PRON- think the price exorbitant cent a bushel a fact have a cousin live in toronto who write that to -PRON- 
now i do not believe in mob rule and anarchy -PRON- go on in quieter tone as though -PRON- realize -PRON- have broach a ticklish subject 
but what be the people to do when the government that rule -PRON- sit back and discuss the situation in cabinet meeting and then suggest an appropriation of four hundred thousand dollar for a thorough investigation which -PRON- propose to extend over a period of six month 
six month when the food crisis be on -PRON- now 
six month when the people in -PRON- large city slum be starve 
six month when anarchy threaten now 
may as well operate on a man after -PRON- be dead as to say -PRON- will deal with this situation in six month 
do -PRON- fellow know what -PRON- be to starve to feel the pinch of hunger gnawing at -PRON- stomach 
i have a touch of -PRON- once be lose three day on a hunting trip in northern canada 
i tell -PRON- hunger will make people do anything 
no six month investigation will not help 
what -PRON- want be action drastic action now now 
-PRON- shout the final now till the car rang with the noise 
there fall a silence 
after -PRON- burst of oratory the silence hang like the hush which follow the boom of a great gun 
karby stare reflectively at this young firebrand 
-PRON- have speak fanaticism yes 
but there be great thought behind -PRON- word a prophetic warning a review of the situation which be startle 
karby glance at the girl diagonally opposite 
-PRON- cheek be red with the flush that have bespread -PRON- some time ago and -PRON- eye like -PRON- stare with a study expression as though -PRON- mind may be rehearse the well point the young fellow have make 
what suggestion would -PRON- offer one of -PRON- companion now ask the speaker 
i would suggest drastic action at once by the government 
but do -PRON- know what i would do if i be one of these peculiar millionaire who have so much money -PRON- didnot know what to do with -PRON- and yet who couldnot get any pleasure any enjoyment out of life 
-PRON- read about these fellow occasionally in the yellow journal the case for instance of a multimillionaire who kill -PRON- because -PRON- couldnot get anything out of life who have be melancholy for month 
there be lot of these man 
well if i be one of -PRON- get some excitement some enjoyment out of this very situation 
do -PRON- know what do 
well tell -PRON- take a town like -PRON- own for example where the food price be high where there reside an egg king like -PRON- friend truxton go into that town and secretly rent a hall a place like the old fair building on south street for example 
then hire an army of man to work for -PRON- and stock that place with everything in the food line i could get hold of spend million send man out through the country to buy up potato egg vegetable can good preserve everything in the eat line and then one day throw -PRON- place open after i have such a supply that -PRON- couldnot buy -PRON- out in a month and slash price practically give the good away 
and egg sell -PRON- for fifteen twenty cent a dozen and put this man truxton out of business 
-PRON- wouldnot benefit the country at large one whit but by george be one millionaire who d be get some enjoyment and excitement out of life 
excitement 
why have a thousand speculator at -PRON- threaten bribe coax what do an idle dream a vision but do -PRON- if i have million of money at -PRON- control 
and then truxton could rot with the egg -PRON- s pile up 
karby be lean forward as if at a play of intense dramatic situation 
-PRON- stare at this orator as though -PRON- have be a luther calm gray eye be now fire and spit forth glint like bit of chipped steel 
-PRON- hand be tremble 
there be a perspiration ooze over -PRON- broad high forehead 
for a second -PRON- glance toward the pretty girl feel a sort of companionship for -PRON- from the fact that -PRON- and -PRON- be in reality the immediate audience 
the girl face be crimson and -PRON- be a prey to confusion 
karby stare at -PRON- fascinate by the guilt which seem to shine in -PRON- feature 
-PRON- sweep -PRON- eye up 
karby catch -PRON- breath with a jerk 
-PRON- be deep eye pretty wide set and the blue in -PRON- now seem gray now blue now gray again 
-PRON- be eye which karby know -PRON- would remember long after -PRON- have forget the accompany detail of -PRON- face eye which -PRON- may awaken at night to see stare at -PRON- out of the vista of -PRON- memory 
for a second karby forget the oratory and the subject that have so stir -PRON- and lose -PRON- in stare at the girl 
come to at last -PRON- turn away -PRON- glance 
at that minute the porter bustle into the car and begin -PRON- obsequious and remunerative task of wield the whiskbroom 
at the next station the orator and -PRON- three friend prepare to alight and -PRON- conversation tell karby that this be -PRON- home town 
without more ado -PRON- follow -PRON- from the train hail a cab and direct to be drive to the good hotel 
karby have find a way of buy -PRON- such an interest in life as -PRON- have never possess 
as -PRON- cab swing out of the station -PRON- see the pretty girl who have sit diagonally opposite -PRON- be hand into a wonderful motorcar by a chauffeur who be the last word in adornment as far as livery be concern and in the rear of the car a striking look man tall and broad and rather gray make room for -PRON- beside -PRON- 
one month later the old fair building on south street be the scene of wonderful activity 
-PRON- be a gigantic frame structure which cover one square block of ground 
time have weathereaten -PRON- paint and -PRON- ornate embellishment but -PRON- hugeness be still intact -PRON- yet loom up big and titanic on a dark night a picture of desolation a reminder of day when the whole county dispense with business for the great part of a week and journey here in drove to witness an exhibition which to -PRON- be the epitome of exposition 
-PRON- be ten year since the place have respond to the call of human patronage and dust and swallow and sparrow bat owl spider and pigeon have usurp the ihterior and by right of conquest claim -PRON- as -PRON- own 
but now the great double door in each of the four street be stand wide open team be drive in and out a veritable thousand man be scurry over the place like rat 
the interior reverberate with the sound of bang hammer and sledge 
joist come down and new and strong one replace -PRON- 
man run hither and thither with blueprint and folding rule 
superintend the work of construction consult with foreman and boss be nathan karby 
-PRON- be ubiquitous now on the inside of the building now on the out direct the laying of a railroad side to -PRON- unload platfqfm 
-PRON- aim seem to be speed unity of action concentration of work to one end in view 
a glance tell the most casual that -PRON- word be law that neither blueprint nor plan verbal nor write contract matter a whit 
what -PRON- say go 
as one day follow another and this army of workman continue -PRON- labor order begin to emanate from the chaos of beam lumber stone brick tiling 
six great long aisle which run the whole length of the building parallel each other like six great street of a city these aisle be very wide and soor -PRON- be equip with counter bin glass case shelve cupboard drawer in -PRON- quarter at the jefferson hotel karby have set up an improvised office and here behind a flat top desk -PRON- interview agent seller farmer grange official salesman 
at the same time -PRON- recruit an army of worker whom -PRON- send out through the country into neighbor city and village 
these agent spread over the land like the tentacle of an octopus and -PRON- go equipped with cash and buy and buy and buy 
karby be elate 
-PRON- be purchase -PRON- interest in life 
-PRON- gray eye shone 
-PRON- catch -PRON- breath and thrust out -PRON- firm jaw and smack -PRON- thin lip when -PRON- anticipate the scene in which -PRON- would soon participate 
the moneyed man of the community would sweep down on -PRON- in drove 
the food speculator and manipulator would haunt -PRON- like a bad dream 
-PRON- would welcome these scene 
-PRON- could scarcely wait for -PRON- to develop 
one noon when karby return to the jefferson for luncheon -PRON- notice in the lobby myriad of young girl who be accost the hotel guest in quest of fund for one of the city hospital 
karby have read in the daily paper that a campaign be be inaugurate to raise a hundred thousand dollar 
people be tag with a yellow check as -PRON- respond with contribution 
karby have escape the campaigner in the street by reason of the fact that -PRON- drive a motorcar and have be off too early in the morning to be approach 
but now the minute -PRON- step into the hotel a most charming young lady pick -PRON- out as -PRON- victim and come hurry toward -PRON- 
karby pause and find -PRON- look into the same pair of beautiful eye that -PRON- have look into that day on the train 
as -PRON- gaze meet -PRON- karby see that -PRON- recognize and place -PRON- on the instant 
the slight shade of confusion sweep over -PRON- for a second and bring a tinge to -PRON- cheek and a downward sweep of the long brown lash 
in this nearer view of -PRON- karby be astound that such a charming creature have be displace for a single day in -PRON- memory by -PRON- absorption in -PRON- scheme 
perhaps -PRON- have read of the campaign to raise money for an addition to one of -PRON- city hospital -PRON- begin tremulously and not without a trace of confusion try not to miss anybody and think perhaps some of the guest at -PRON- hotel may want to subscribe 
i suppose -PRON- a worthy object karby say easily play for time for the purpose of detain the girl longer a stranger here -PRON- know 
oh indeed i can vouch for the worthiness of this hospital 
-PRON- do need money so badly and -PRON- must have more room or i donot know what -PRON- will do 
-PRON- will be so grateful for anything -PRON- may care to give 
-PRON- select a tag from a bundle in -PRON- hand and make ready to tie -PRON- through the lapel of -PRON- coat 
i should think that in these time karby reply still angle for some scheme to detain the girl that a couple of gross of good fresh egg would be about as acceptable as anything else to a hospital 
karby have intend to elaborate on the remark and give -PRON- quite a facetious turn but the girl action check -PRON- 
-PRON- flush red to the root of -PRON- hair deep deep red -PRON- eye go down and -PRON- see -PRON- lip quiver 
whei -PRON- lash go up -PRON- see that -PRON- eye be wet with tear of wound pride and hurt vanity 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- for just a second then turn so cold that -PRON- very glance chill -PRON- to the bone 
then -PRON- seem to rise straight than ever as -PRON- stand there like a statue 
i should not have accost -PRON- -PRON- say icily 
i should have know that one must expect to find -PRON- type in hotel 
-PRON- make as though to move past -PRON- but -PRON- touch -PRON- on the arm and detain -PRON- 
i beg -PRON- pardon -PRON- say sincerely 
believe -PRON- i mean no offense whatever 
i be so sorry admit -PRON- remark be ill choose to one who be a stranger to -PRON- 
i apologize 
i want -PRON- to accept something for this worthy cause 
i do not care to have -PRON- name mention or even know but if -PRON- will wait here just a bit while i go to the bank and draw -PRON- contribution in cash 
i should like to give a thousand dollar 
-PRON- will wait and -PRON- will assure -PRON- that -PRON- have overlook -PRON- remark 
-PRON- smile at -PRON- and -PRON- smile be nearly as contagious as -PRON- own 
-PRON- murmur something in the affirmative and -PRON- be go 
when -PRON- come back -PRON- hand -PRON- a seal envelope and permit -PRON- to tie a tag to -PRON- lapel 
be -PRON- fate or destiny or marvelous coincidence that the very next day on motoring into the country to interview some farmer engine trouble leave -PRON- strand mile from the city and -PRON- happen along in a huge touringcar order -PRON- chauffeur to stop and render aid and -PRON- car refuse all call to motion -PRON- be unconventional enough to give -PRON- a lift back to town 
moreover -PRON- be affable to the extent of engage in conversation a tribute which the occasion do not necessarily demand of -PRON- 
karby be elate 
meantime work progress rapidly on the old fair building 
such an army of man must soon accomplish result 
karby spare no expense be thorough to a detail although -PRON- natural business ability see to -PRON- that no cash be waste 
in two week the building be near completion and the traffic manager whom karby have import from one of the large railroad begin deliver carload after carload of foodstuff 
-PRON- seem as though the world production of potato be be empty into the building agent penetrate the country to -PRON- depth have drive -PRON- into locality where the food shortage and the speculator have not set foot and -PRON- be able to buy at price far under those demand by wholesaler in the city 
karby -PRON- marvel at the mile which these provision be cover to reach -PRON- 
without be conscious of -PRON- -PRON- have whip together a wonderful organization 
and not alone potato come flood into -PRON- place 
every know popular and necessary edible which mankind cater to come in superabundance 
of course the town soon begin to wonder about the project 
the press send reporter in drove to interview foreman laborer superintendent contractor but karby -PRON- have give no information to a single soul and therefore -PRON- could divulge nothing 
rumor and idle gossip and speculation run high 
the newspaper supply fiction where fact be lack and by publish something which be not true tempt karby to state -PRON- real purpose a trick of the press by the way but karby only smile and hold -PRON- peace 
-PRON- mean to open -PRON- great relief store as -PRON- call -PRON- on a monday morning and the precede sunday -PRON- intend to carry a brief but glare ad in the paper of the town state -PRON- list of price and -PRON- purpose in sell at cost or below 
the whole gigantic affair be to be a loss to karby from begin to end 
financier would have stand back appal at the idea and have -PRON- see -PRON- expense account and compare -PRON- with -PRON- intend selling price -PRON- would have succumb to emotion or vote karby a subject for an asylum 
karby forget no detail 
as the time approach to divulge -PRON- great scheme -PRON- employ a corps of detective and upon -PRON- advice procure the service of two hundred special deputy 
-PRON- money bring certain politician to exert -PRON- power which make the deputy possible 
these deputy guard the building day and night 
-PRON- be a necessary precaution 
food manipulator be none too exact about the mean -PRON- employ and karby be advise that once -PRON- scheme be out and the finer point of -PRON- great plan be discover the rage of the speculator would soar and -PRON- may possibly stoop to force to thwart -PRON- scheme 
meantime -PRON- detective be busy take such step as would prevent speculator agent invade the store when -PRON- do open and buy up the foodstuff 
on friday the building be an arsenal of provision 
and -PRON- be on this friday about four oclock that the storm break 
karby have return to the hotel early and be sit at -PRON- desk frame the advertisement which -PRON- desire for the sunday press when mason one of -PRON- clerk enter and inform -PRON- that a delegation of six man desire to see -PRON- that -PRON- would present no card and appear to be the gloomy surly group of individual -PRON- have ever see 
karby send out a detective to explain that -PRON- be at present engage and would be unable to see -PRON- 
-PRON- also order the detective to discover if possible something of -PRON- identity and to refuse to book -PRON- for any interview as -PRON- didnot wish to argue -PRON- position to anybody 
the detective return swelter 
-PRON- declare -PRON- have never put in such a ten minute that the six have nearly tom -PRON- to piece and -PRON- have only get rid of -PRON- by threaten to call for help and have -PRON- eject forcibly from the suite 
-PRON- also report that the big man of the assemblage be truxton the egg king and that -PRON- have with -PRON- a man name macavey -PRON- secretary and a farmer whom the detective discover be president of one of the grange 
another of the man be proprietor of a large wholesale house in the city and the remain two -PRON- could find nothing about 
from that moment on karby be more seek after than the president of the united state 
a double and then a quadruple guard be place before -PRON- suite and all afternoon and late into the evening man come excited man enrage man perturb man man who plead threaten then plead again to be grant an interview 
karby turn -PRON- all down 
-PRON- would see no one whose business -PRON- do not know beforehand 
-PRON- be force to dine in -PRON- room as a precaution against annoyance and -PRON- spend the evening read the town paper 
the reporter have at last hit upon something like the truth and have display the news in glare headline 
this no doubt be responsible for -PRON- popularity and have set the six excited man on -PRON- heel 
speculation run high 
one sheet carry a brief editorial comment in a general way on the rumor and offer neither praise nor condemnation of the plan 
karby smile 
-PRON- order the night guard at the store double and go to bed 
the next morning early the interviewer start -PRON- vigil and line up in the corridor outside -PRON- door until the place look like the floor of the new york stock exchange 
at eleven karby apply to the hotel management for aid with the result that the police be call in clear the corridor patrol the place and keep -PRON- clear 
at eleventhirty one of the policeman bring karby a card state that a very beautiful woman have send -PRON- in and desire to see mr karby on a matter of the utmost importance 
karby glance at the name on the card which read simply miss truxton 
karby stare at the card as though fascinate 
at first -PRON- calm and rather tantalize smile pucker -PRON- lip but -PRON- sober immediately and study the situation a second 
so -PRON- have get a delegate through at last -PRON- be resort to a woman to tell -PRON- message the egg king daughter sense of chivalry produce a struggle within -PRON- 
ordinarily -PRON- would have be invulnerable to this means of reach -PRON- but if a woman of breeding be willing to sacrifice -PRON- pride to the extent of come here to see -PRON- -PRON- believe -PRON- should grant the interview 
-PRON- tell the policeman to admit -PRON- 
karby go to the window and stand look out 
-PRON- hear -PRON- enter hear the door close softly hear -PRON- take a step into the place and then pause apparently to collect -PRON- 
this be what karby desire 
-PRON- turn slowly and look into the exquisite eye of the woman on the train die very girl who have approach -PRON- in the hotel lobby solicit donation to lakeside hospital 
-PRON- be dress in a tailor suit and present that wellgroome and welltende appearance that have so impress -PRON- when -PRON- first see -PRON- 
-PRON- wear a hat which rather shield -PRON- face but -PRON- do not prevent -PRON- see the look of incredulity that sweep into -PRON- feature as -PRON- recognize -PRON- 
as for -PRON- karby be not sure whether -PRON- change color or no 
-PRON- merely stare at -PRON- again a prey to -PRON- exquisite eye 
-PRON- be a shock the knowledge that this girl be the egg king daughter and even as -PRON- stand there look at -PRON- the realization of the situation come over -PRON- 
the plan of -PRON- general relief store the slashing of price the egg -PRON- already have in stock which -PRON- be go to sell for a song all mean ruin financial downfall for truxton 
-PRON- have know this before all along and have even count on -PRON- but now the realization seem to turn cold and dampen -PRON- ardor 
the girl be the first to recover -PRON- 
-PRON- come forward hold out -PRON- hand and smile frankly into -PRON- eye 
i be so glad to find some one here that i know come to see mr karby -PRON- will present -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- will make thing so much easy for -PRON- 
great heaven -PRON- hadnot yet awaken to the real situation 
-PRON- smile rather wistfully shake -PRON- head slowly and say quietly miss truxton i be mr karby 
the horror that come into -PRON- feature be only compensate by -PRON- beauty 
-PRON- eye open until -PRON- imagine -PRON- be look into two wonderful world and -PRON- fall back one two three pace and stare at -PRON- 
karby turn slightly to give -PRON- a chance to recover from the shock of -PRON- announcement 
when -PRON- face -PRON- again -PRON- be stare calmly at -PRON- -PRON- big eye regard -PRON- with something of awe 
i hadnot dream that -PRON- be mr karby although i may have guess put two and two together 
-PRON- be on the train that day and hear the wild talk of that wild youth 
mr karby -PRON- take a step forward and stare hard at -PRON- -PRON- isnot true that -PRON- be go to open -PRON- store and sell at such low price that -PRON- will ruin those who have stock up on thing hope to sell when the price be up 
karby smile 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head slowly in the affirmative and say quietly afraid -PRON- all true miss truxton put into effect the very idea which that wild youth as -PRON- call -PRON- declare -PRON- would follow if -PRON- be one of those eccentric and peculiar millionaire who couldnot get any enjoyment out of life 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- permit -PRON- the full view of -PRON- wonderful eye and the sweet feature that go with -PRON- 
karby catch -PRON- breath 
-PRON- find a madness seize upon -PRON- a madness which -PRON- thrust back with an effort 
-PRON- know what -PRON- call -PRON- father -PRON- go on slowly 
the egg king though i didnot know until now that -PRON- be -PRON- daughter 
i understand now why -PRON- remark that day cause -PRON- such annoyance but i be not aware of -PRON- identity then 
-PRON- pass over the explanation as though -PRON- consider -PRON- trivial in comparison with what -PRON- have come to say 
-PRON- will slash the price on egg mr karby 
storage egg for twenty cent per dozen fresh one for twentyfive and the strict kind of fresh egg guarantee for thirty 
-PRON- mean financial ruin to -PRON- father -PRON- say slowly -PRON- eye not meet -PRON- directly but stare at the wall as though -PRON- be speak some speech which -PRON- have commit to memory 
-PRON- have two hundred thousand gross of egg in storage listen mr karby -PRON- father stand ready to buy up every egg -PRON- possess for forty cent a dozen if -PRON- will agree not to stock up any more 
karby shake -PRON- head and smile 
no miss truxton i canot be buy neither can the egg i have 
those egg be for housewife who havenot have the privilege of own egg in any quantity for month 
man who have corner the egg market will have to suffer along with those people who corner potato sugar 
-PRON- father be not the only one miss truxton 
but mr karby -PRON- father have do no wrong 
why people buy real estate and hold -PRON- until price go way up and then sell the legitimate way to make money 
why do -PRON- enter into this wild scheme lose million of dollar by -PRON- 
exactly miss truxton 
-PRON- pause collect -PRON- and face -PRON- squarely 
miss truxton -PRON- be more than coincidence that day which bring -PRON- a listener to that wild youth with -PRON- fanatical scheme 
but i be one of the very man -PRON- describe a millionaire if -PRON- will permit -PRON- the term lor lack of a well who could see nothing interesting in life 
i be a veritable nomad on the face of the earth 
that very trip i be make have no definite destination in view 
i be just go from one place to another seek something that would enliven -PRON- and i find -PRON- 
never in all -PRON- existence have i be so keenly interested in life as now 
this exploit have make -PRON- 
i shall never forget -PRON- 
of course i shall be lose million by the scheme but what of -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- own money 
moreover i be not stupid enough to believe that this one relief store as i call -PRON- will affect the price of the country in general 
-PRON- wonot 
-PRON- canot 
but -PRON- satisfy -PRON- serve -PRON- purpose and some of the people will benefit by -PRON- 
and -PRON- would not consider sell out -PRON- egg to father at the price -PRON- name 
most decidedly no miss truxton 
well remember mr karby that i come to -PRON- and make -PRON- an offer forget this 
i want to give -PRON- a chance 
-PRON- spume -PRON- 
man mr karby donot give up easily especially when -PRON- see -PRON- fortune slip away as -PRON- threaten to make -PRON- slip away 
mr karby 
before -PRON- could reply -PRON- be go 
karby stare after -PRON- rehearse -PRON- final word and try to ferret out -PRON- hide meaning 
why have -PRON- come to see -PRON- 
have old truxton really offer to buy -PRON- egg or have -PRON- come for some other purpose 
-PRON- have give -PRON- a chance 
-PRON- final speech hint at trouble seem to insinuate a threat 
what do these food speculator mean to do 
what scheme have -PRON- father concoct to thwart -PRON- 
and do -PRON- know that scheme 
-PRON- word sound as though -PRON- do 
that night at nine -PRON- have the answer

if the rabble be a thousand strong when the message reach -PRON- -PRON- have double by the time -PRON- arrive at the outskirt of the crowd 
-PRON- park -PRON- machine and proceed on foot 
whoever have stir up the mob and have put the riot idea into -PRON- head have dohe a good work for the speculator 
there be woman in the horde wildeye woman some hold baby in -PRON- arm some lead child by the hand 
-PRON- be a motley throng a throng of all nationality speak polyglot tongue 
and above all come the cry of -PRON- be hungry -PRON- be hungry 
alcohol have do -PRON- work 
money must have be disburse freely 
the move be hardly one of eleventh hour fomentation but hold be brew all through the day possibly for several day 
karby stand aghast

-PRON- be safe 
but -PRON- heart sink 
-PRON- two hundred deputy be on duty but violence may ensue and death may result 
and this karby wish to avoid 
the instigator have do -PRON- part thoroughly 
karby could tell by the stray bit of talk -PRON- pick up 
a millionaire who have be work for month corner potato sugar egg be ready to unload on the public at hitherto unheard of high price 
the people be to be rob 
-PRON- be one of the cause of the food shortage throughout the country 
karby stand bewilder by what -PRON- hear 
-PRON- listen to threat against -PRON- life violence against the building which house -PRON- provision the provision -PRON- have be week collect for the relief of these poor delude creature 
karby censure -PRON- for -PRON- lack of foresight 
if -PRON- have only advertise -PRON- sale in the saturday paper instead of wait until sunday all would have be well 
but now quotation would lead the people to believe that -PRON- be the mob that have force -PRON- to the low price and that -PRON- have not be -PRON- intention from the first 
if only -PRON- could work -PRON- way to the front but this be impossible 
-PRON- must stand here an idle spectator and await development 
and then the mob close in press together make of -PRON- a body more compact 
a great din arise 
shout and jeer rent the air 
threat be no longer mutter beneath breath or hiss into the ear of nearby companion but be shout openly 
a few police perhaps thirty or forty appear on the outskirt of the crowd and try to disperse the people but mob and riot be new to the police of this city and -PRON- be incompetent to handle the situation 
the hope -PRON- presence have inspire in karby die 
by this time the rabble have press so close to the building that karby be scarcely forty foot from -PRON- 
-PRON- could see a dim light burn through the window and -PRON- deputy on guard armed to the tooth 
the rioter increase -PRON- shout and jeer 
wave of motion ripple over the mob as though -PRON- mean to rush the place and storm -PRON- by force 
some one presently hurl a brick which crash through a window 
at the noise of fall glass the crowd go crazy 
karby sicken 
-PRON- be all over 
-PRON- be on the verge of violence 
-PRON- deputy may control the situation by the use of arm but this would be awful 
then suddenly the whole building blaze forth with light and make the surround scenery bright as day 
man could be see hurry to and fro in the store and presently in every window there be post one of the huge placard bear the price which be to go into effect monday morning 
the jeer of the crowd die 
silence develop 
those who could read english peruse the sign hungrily 
presently a low hum ripple through the mob 
-PRON- be translate to -PRON- companion what -PRON- see 
again semblance of silence ensue as though the rabble be consider -PRON- course 
this be intrude upon by yell of a lie a game believe those sign and karby know these cry come from pay instigator 
some shout to burn the place provision and all while other shriek to storm -PRON- and carry the foodstuff away 
but the majority be quiet 
the print price be there before -PRON- eye 
the multitude be plainly puzzle and perhaps disappoint 
-PRON- have come to do violence 
-PRON- be to be cheat of -PRON- prey 
this be to be a store for -PRON- 
these price be within -PRON- reach 
there be something wrong 
in vain do the instigator try to incite violence try to rush the people forward in a great attack movement 
but the throng be plainly stir and karby know by the attitude of those near -PRON- that -PRON- have be impress 
the psychology of the mob be a study 
-PRON- be like a torpedo -PRON- must be handle rightly or -PRON- may boomerang and attack those that assemble -PRON- 
some one suddenly shout at the top of -PRON- lung get the egg king corner egg 
-PRON- admit -PRON- 
-PRON- ask what be the public go to do about -PRON- show -PRON- 
to the egg king house to the egg king house 
karby catch a glimpse of the fellow who have raise the cry 
-PRON- be the orator who have speak that day on the train 
in a second the mob have take up the slogan and karby hear the noise of rush foot and the next instant the whole mass swing into movement and dash on -PRON- way 
karby be sweep along with -PRON- 
-PRON- mind work fast 
once -PRON- gain house the rage -PRON- would have vent on -PRON- store and foodstuff would burst forth with increase and add vigor 
karby dare not think what -PRON- may do to the place 
-PRON- be armed with all sort of weapon and would as soon fire the mansion as anything else and once this rabble understand the real situation and -PRON- be likely that some one in the crowd may stumble upon the truth at any second -PRON- rage would know no bound 
karby think frantically 
-PRON- slow -PRON- pace and permit the rush madman to pass -PRON- 
presently -PRON- find -PRON- so separate from the straggler that -PRON- stop altogether turn and make for -PRON- automobile 
-PRON- gaifie -PRON- jump in swung past -PRON- building and sing out order to -PRON- deputy to leave two or three of -PRON- on guard and for the other to hurry to the house of the egg king 
the order be receive rather sullenly and there be sign of rebellion but the promise of a handsome reward if -PRON- save the place effect the desire change and karby be satisfied to see -PRON- start forth in pursuit of the mob to do what -PRON- could to quell the riot 
karby then take one of -PRON- into -PRON- car to show -PRON- the way to the truxton house 
down one street up another -PRON- fly take the short route in the effort to get there before the mob arrive 
karby could hear the rioter in the distance and urge -PRON- car to great speed 
at last a huge residence loom into view 
karby alight and rush through the spacious ground up a broad flight of front step on to a wonderful veranda and rang the bell 
a butler respond and karby do not wait for ceremony but brush past -PRON- into the house 
-PRON- burst into a room where -PRON- hear voice and throw into violent agitation miss truxton -PRON- mother and truxton -PRON- who be at a deskphone in smile conversation with somebody 
the egg king be a tall man well developed and broad 
-PRON- hair be gray -PRON- eye active but rather small and sparkling 
-PRON- lower the phone and stare aghast as karby sweep into the room and rush toward -PRON- 
quick -PRON- have not a minute to lose 
escape from this house at once 
the mob -PRON- stir up against -PRON- truxton have turn on -PRON- and be now head here shout get the egg kin get the egg king 
-PRON- only stare at -PRON- apparently too overcome to comprehend what -PRON- word mean 
mrs truxton a sweet rather weakfaced woman who look as though -PRON- very life be dominate by this husband of her show sign of swooning 
truxton -PRON- rise slowly to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- be karby -PRON- begin and -PRON- be evident -PRON- intend work -PRON- into a rage but karby interrupt -PRON- 
yes i be karby but for sake hurry 
that mob which -PRON- own agent stir up be mad mad not alone out of belief in the justice of -PRON- cause but mad from the alcohol which -PRON- money furnish -PRON- 
do -PRON- want to be trap here like rat no tell what -PRON- will do 
-PRON- surround -PRON- storehouse threaten violence and wculd have demolish the place have not -PRON- deputy think to flash in the window the huge poster bear the price list which will go into effect on monday 
then the mob turn and with a shout of get the egg king stampede down the street 
i come here to warn -PRON- -PRON- more than -PRON- deserve but i donot want to see violence do 
listen 
-PRON- rush to the window and throw -PRON- open 
in the distance come the roar of the mob gather in violence as the second fly 
i have turn -PRON- deputy in to try to quell -PRON- but there be no quelling that angry mob 
-PRON- lust for destruction 
give -PRON- butler order to get the servant out of the house and come yourself wait to order -PRON- car 
i have -PRON- outside 
the police truxton begin with a movement toward the phone but karby stop -PRON- 
the police be powerless forty of -PRON- try to quell the mob before -PRON- place and fail 
a torrent of angry voice now burst upon the air 
the sound bring aetion 
truxton pale and with set lip give order to the butler 
then karby lead -PRON- from the house to -PRON- machine and pilot the same to a side street where -PRON- draw up and bade -PRON- wait while -PRON- go forward to see what -PRON- could do 
even as -PRON- start the noise increase to bedlam and -PRON- see the advance guard of the mob close in on the truxton place 
-PRON- pause before -PRON- and wait until -PRON- number be sufficiently augment to begin violence 
karby see that -PRON- be cut off from -PRON- deputy 
-PRON- stand there wonder what to do when a movement near -PRON- cause -PRON- to wheel about 
miss truxton stand there beside -PRON- 
i come after -PRON- i make -PRON- let -PRON- 
mr karby i want -PRON- to know that i think -PRON- be white as the saying go one of the white man i have ever hear of 
father be impress by -PRON- action by -PRON- come to warn -PRON- 
-PRON- shudder and draw near to -PRON- as a perfect howl and shriek of rage ascend from the mob 
a patrol wagon clatter by and dump a score or more of police who rush at the mob with a great flourish of club and pistol 
but -PRON- be intimidate almost immediately and hadnot the courage to use firearm against this bedlam of rave people 
so -PRON- stand there try to awe the crowd by -PRON- uniform and shout for -PRON- to disperse 
the shout be answer by cry of derision and hoot of laughter and some one hurl a missile which crash through one of the truxton window 
in a second the house be bombard with brick and stone and club 
the glass shower down like rain 
the girl clutch karby s hand and hide -PRON- face in -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- throw -PRON- arm about -PRON- and try to murmur word of comfort 
at the same instant there come to -PRON- a great idea 
-PRON- bid -PRON- follow -PRON- rush to a corner and turn in a fire alarm 
in a second -PRON- seem the firebell be ring and the apparatus could be hear in the distance the gong clang ferociously 
karby go into the crowd and speak a word or two to the police who catch the idea immediately withdraw to the street intersection and when the fire apparatus draw up order the fireman to attach the hose to the waterplug 
this be do in a minute the fireman realize instantly that the power of disperse the angry mob lie in -PRON- hand 
the police give the word and great stream of water come tear from the nozzle with terrific force 
these stream be turn directly on the mob 
the throng be stun 
a cry of rage go up 
those in the front rank make a rush at the fireman but the nearer -PRON- come the great be the force of the water 
the leader pause irresolute 
at the same time another stream and then another and another be turn upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be be soak like drown rat 
still -PRON- stand -PRON- ground too stunned and bewilder apparently to retreat 
in another minute three more stream be deluge the crowd and at a suggestion of karby s these latter stream be direct over the head of the near in an effort to reach the outskirt of the throng 
this do the work 
as the water descend on the straggler in the rear -PRON- give way thus make room for those in advance of -PRON- to retreat 
at the same time the fireman rush forward wield -PRON- hose with deadly accuracy 
several man be knock down by the force of the stream and the woman in the crowd break and fly for shelter 
this be a signal to ply the water with great agility and the fireman follow up -PRON- advantage as the now bewilder mob give way 
presently the rioter break helterskelter and in one mad plunge turn and flee get away from the merciless torrent as best -PRON- could 
in another ten minute the street be clear 
heloise truxton draw close to karby and as -PRON- start back for the machine -PRON- tell -PRON- softly i come to -PRON- today because i know -PRON- father and -PRON- agent be go to recruit a mob to try to demolish -PRON- great store

-PRON- face be upturned to -PRON- and on a sudden -PRON- stoop and kiss -PRON- 
-PRON- lip be not unresponsive but yield with a warmth that thrill -PRON- to the soul 
-PRON- murmur word to -PRON- which be for -PRON- ear alone and -PRON- arm come up and tighten about -PRON- neck 
and then the city rock with the roar of an explosion that make the very ground beneath karby and the girl tremble 
the concussion be awful 
karby disengage -PRON- hold -PRON- at arm length and stare in the direction of -PRON- store 
there come a faint illumination from that point and then the heaven flame with a deep red glare and karby see tongue of fire shoot up and up and up and gain ground as the second go by

i ainot get any nerve -PRON- mutter as -PRON- swing -PRON- fill scoop up to the furnace door scatter the coal over the fire 
i ainot get any nerve 
-PRON- shovel fiercely for a minute and slam the door 
then -PRON- straighten up and lean against -PRON- shovel 
and everybody on the ship know -PRON- too -PRON- add 
a vivid picture of the shameful scene of an hour before come to -PRON- 
why have -PRON- not fight when fisher give -PRON- the lie before the other on the pier -PRON- -PRON- mumble i ainot get any nerve 
-PRON- pause and narrow -PRON- eye

every one of -PRON- have return with more stimulant under -PRON- belt than be good for -PRON-

that may lose -PRON- -PRON- berth 
the rough crowd have make a day of -PRON- a day to remember 
-PRON- spend all of -PRON- money and most of -PRON- energy 
-PRON- be peaceable enough until -PRON- foot touch the splinter plank of the pier

-PRON- say nothing when -PRON- come up 
-PRON- only poke each other and grin

the engineroom bell jingle and the engine start 
when egan climbetl to the deck after -PRON- watch below the ship be glide through the narrow fly a row of flag from -PRON- signal halyard 
a ragged smudge drift from the big funnel toward the staten island shore almost blot out a battleship that lie anchor there 
egan stand by the rail for a minute

the ship be near the end of the voyage 
the skipper check -PRON- position on a chart and call the engineer 
-PRON- talk quietly for a minute 
the engineer nod and return to the engineroom 
-PRON- give an order and the sweat stoker work furiously in the dim light of the dingy pit 
-PRON- watch -PRON- fire carefully 
-PRON- shovel and poke and shovel again 
-PRON- work like slave and the quiver hand on the pressuregage gradually rise 
five pound ten pound and the pop valve on boiler open 
-PRON- hiss malevolently for a moment and close 
the shovel clang against the furnace door and scrape under the pile of coal 
then one of the stoker collapse 
-PRON- be carry to a ventilator and another stoker be call 
-PRON- drop down the ladder and take -PRON- place

for a moment -PRON- almost join the rush 
then -PRON- see a stream of dirty water trickle through a crack in the bulkhead 
-PRON- think of the boiler that would explode if the water reach -PRON- 
with a leap -PRON- reach the frightened man at the foot of the ladder 
-PRON- fling -PRON- aside and stand with -PRON- back to the only escape from the pit

for a moment the other watch -PRON- sheeplike 
one start suddenly for the ladder 
egan step back and strike -PRON- 
the man stagger -PRON- mouth bleeding 
-PRON- look at egan for an instant 
then -PRON- turn and open the furnace door 
the other do the same 
the burn coal tumble from the grate and hiss into the water that wash about the floor 
-PRON- grow deep forward 
egan pause for a moment to haul the still unconscious fisher onto a pile of coal 
the fire be ptille and still the man hesitate 
steam be fill the dingy place 
the water continue to rise 
fume from the coal on the floor all but strangle the man

egan pick -PRON- up 
the electric light suddenly go out 
the inrush of water have lessen but the steam be awful 
egan gasp for air and splash through the blackness 
-PRON- grope for the ladder in the dark 
for a moment -PRON- could not find -PRON-

then -PRON- outstretche hand grasp a rung 
with fisher on -PRON- shoulder -PRON- start to climb 
-PRON- try to hold -PRON- breath against the gas and the steam 
-PRON- reach a landing gasping and fall against another ladder 
this -PRON- clutch and climb again 
sunlight stream through a companionway 
wearily -PRON- walk out onto the list deck and let fisher slip gently from -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- see a british destroyer stand by -PRON- thin bow twist 
-PRON- ram -PRON- say some one beside -PRON- where -PRON- go down 
egan look and see a little distance off a large uneven stain upon the water 
-PRON- be oil 
rapidly -PRON- grow large and from beneath -PRON- a steady stream of bubble wobble slowly to the surface and break 
egan lean against the rail and with -PRON- mind eye see a ghastly struggle against violent death far down beneath the quiet water where the crush submarine be send up -PRON- die gasp with each bubble that break on the surface 
how much water in the hold demand the captain of no one in particular 
not very much sir answer egan in a funny little voice 
and the fire be pull 
i donot believe well sink sir 
-PRON- lean weakly against the rail 
-PRON- hear some one tell the captain of the fight in the stokehole 
-PRON- listen and a tired smile creep over -PRON- face 
well -PRON- mutter to -PRON- i show -PRON- but -PRON- gawd i be scare 
a on a bound pullman car that like a vision from afar in matchless beauty tress of gold and eye to turn the arctic cold to tropic shimmer with -PRON- glance and way suggest song and dance -PRON- dawn and hold -PRON- neath a spell no word can adequately tell but oh good lord 
when evening fall -PRON- how -PRON- snore the cry of indian lifting scalp 
the avalanche of the alp 
the roar of cannon and of shot 
the echo of some mammoth grot 
the scream of seagull in -PRON- flight 
the song of treetoad in the night 
the oompah of the big bassoon 
the honk of some impending loon all get aboard and swell the tune that phyllis snore 
mozart and verdi both be there and hint of wagner fill the air and every dissonance in life be add to the nasal strife that permeate near and far each nook and cranny of the car and make -PRON- feel as if i trod some encrimson sod where nation war and shoe as on -PRON- snore 
oh maxim great or edison -PRON- matter not to -PRON- which one wilt thou not take this chance in mind and for the good of all mankind some day from out thy genius rare devise an instrument with care a sort of nasal silencer to still the tumult and the whir that wholly floor -PRON- heart when lovely phyllis snore 
john kendrick bang a oar leniver carew people all around here be key up to quite a pitch of excitement 
george eastman have just come back from the quaint little general store of the tropical seaside town bear a can of petrol for a roadcar in which -PRON- and -PRON- wife be tour the french island colony all over the homecoming of a famous criminal and outlaw a man name victor berard continue eastman as -PRON- prepare to feed the volatile fluid to the hungry machine 
-PRON- have be do a tenyear term in the penal colony of new caledonia and be such a desperate character that -PRON- return to the island fill the native with a dread which -PRON- seem to find almost delightful 
berard -PRON- seem be singularly savage and ferocious and have the most amazing courage a deadshot with rifle and pistol and a terrible artist with the knife 
these people be absolutely ecstatic over the prospect of be slaughter in -PRON- house as soon as -PRON- return to resume -PRON- depredation 
i could hardly persuade -PRON- to sell -PRON- the petrol there be such a buzz of gossip in the store better put -PRON- car on the first ship that s leave and get away from here before the terror begin say louise eastman with a nervous little laugh 
i donot think care for the tropical variety of robin hood 
i fancy that victor berard be a sort of island tradition sniff -PRON- husband with a shrug 
these emotional people cherish -PRON- bad man -PRON- know and paint -PRON- and -PRON- escapade in vivid color worry about -PRON- the return of berard will add another note of romance to the tale -PRON- shall hear 
the sublime extravagance of go halfway round the world by motor will come near enough to ruin -PRON- george say -PRON- wife without have a distinguished bandit capture and hold -PRON- for ransom 
i be already disappoint in ouf distinguished bandit chuckle eastman 
-PRON- would have have something more than ten year at hard labor if -PRON- have do anything splendidly devilish afraid that sober analysis will narrow -PRON- depredation down to sheep stealing or something sordid like that 
-PRON- may as well forget -PRON- and go about -PRON- business 
i manage to extract a few bit of in515 formation there at the store in spite of the breathless chatter about the bandit a tiny primitive but highly respectable inn about halfway down the south shore of the island and -PRON- will apparently do very well for -PRON- dinner and night lodging 
the innkeeper wife speak and cook in french spanish and english and the man -PRON- sell supply for motorcar in at least two language 
with a pleasant prospect of a savory meal and decent lodging on the shore of a lately savage island -PRON- motor along the sandy beach road glisten with shell of pearl and amber and opal hue and lap soothingly by the gentle sapphire sea 
in place of the cawing crow of the traveler home cornfield green and scarlet parrot scream in the top of the coconutpalm and the small animal that scramble among the branch be monkey not squirrel

-PRON- turn and peer sharply at the innkeeper as the latter obediently bring in the bottle of wine 
friend tournier -PRON- say i have return to -PRON- beloved island with empty pocket 
i be unhappily force to trouble -PRON- for assistance at once

tourni deposit the bottle on the table with a thud and begin to tremble with an ague of terror 
have mercy berard -PRON- cry brokenly 
-PRON- should know well that i have not a quarter of so much money in all the world and that to give -PRON- even a thousand franc would ruin -PRON- mme 
tourni throw -PRON- apron over -PRON- head and burst into dismal wail rock -PRON- body backward and forward and wring -PRON- hand

i be not easily move by a woman tear mme 
tourni say berard impatiently much less when -PRON- be shed in cloudburst to the accompaniment of such devilish howling

-PRON- will be beautiful sublime 
yes yes that be an end to all -PRON- press problem of the moment 
i fear that -PRON- j rather broadly monsieur eastman say quietly 
i be not unwilling to help a fellow traveler on -PRON- way with a few franc from -PRON- pocket but -PRON- wife and i be spend even more than -PRON- can well afford on -PRON- travel and -PRON- be not wealthy person by any mean 
american be protect by -PRON- government at home -PRON- know from such danger as capture for ransom and blackmail 
any unpleasantness -PRON- may be rash enough to cause -PRON- would quickly grow into an international affair 
that would mean too much publicity for -PRON- -PRON- see and -PRON- would hardly get off with ten year in new caledonia 
-PRON- be a man of evident intelligence berard and i think i make -PRON- clear 
the outlaw sprawl over the table and leer at the american 
fifty thousand franc -PRON- say with emphasis upon each word 
the money must be pay at once or i shall lose patience 
let -PRON- then have no more foolish talk 
if -PRON- be not pay 
eastman query meet the man ugly glance unflinchingly 
berard take a sip of wine then languidly draw from -PRON- pocket a huge navy revolver which -PRON- place beside -PRON- on the table with elaborate care 
why then -PRON- say at last if the money be not pay the affair will become melancholy tragic 
the lovely madame will suddenly become a lovely widow and i shall have the honor of be -PRON- escort upon -PRON- travel 
-PRON- be too simple to need more explanation monsieur 
look here a note of deep concern sound in voice as -PRON- see -PRON- wifes face blanch i refuse to take this outrageous affair seriously 
-PRON- be not a fool -PRON- must know what a row -PRON- would kick up by make any trouble for -PRON- 
the world be too small for such villainy as -PRON- suggest berard 
as a matter of fact if the life of both -PRON- and -PRON- wife be actually at stake -PRON- could not in any way raise such a sum as fifty thousand franc particularly in this part of the earth 
make -PRON- an offer drawl berard with the suavity of a tradesman 
great heaven not haggle with -PRON- cry eastman angrily havenot the slight thought of be in danger from -PRON- and i wouldnot give -PRON- a sou an impudent swashbuckler -PRON- have play upon the ignorant fear of the native here and -PRON- have get an exaggerated idea of -PRON- importance 
i donot care a snap of the finger for -PRON- or for -PRON- threat 
come lou -PRON- add to -PRON- trembling wife well go to -PRON- room and tomorrow see the proper authority about the outrageous action of this bully 
have a care monsieur speak up the innkeeper in a shake voice 
believe -PRON- -PRON- do not know half the evil that berard be capable of 
-PRON- be a braver man than monsieur but -PRON- will pay a great price for -PRON- defiance 
i speak as a friend 
victor berard take the big revolver from the table and -PRON- thick stubby forefinger crook indolently around the trigger 
-PRON- talk like an american and a fool -PRON- say to eastman harshly 
do not try to leave the room 
if -PRON- reach the door monsieur -PRON- will be as a dead man stretch across the threshold 
-PRON- wife will then have the choice of go with -PRON- or of die i do not permit woman to worry -PRON- 
i will have money tonight or -PRON- can not live until the morning 
-PRON- be weave a terrible net around -PRON- berard declare eastman tensely and -PRON- face have grow as white as that of -PRON- wife 
-PRON- can gain nothing from this folly but a return to prison 
with -PRON- traveler letter of credit and all the credential that i have i could not raise more than five thousand franc at the american consul office 
and even so i would not give -PRON- the small part of that 
now think well of what -PRON- be do 
go to the american consul now order the outlaw and bring -PRON- the five thousand franc 
i will take that and -PRON- shall see what will come later 
-PRON- wife will remain here and i shall wait two hour for -PRON- to make the journey in -PRON- motor 
yes i will be gracious i will take the five thousand franc 
i believe -PRON- be insane say eastman 
do -PRON- think that if i go to the consul office i would not return directly with police with french marine with all the authority that i could get back of -PRON- 
-PRON- frank assurance be ridiculous 
not at all monsieur reply the outlaw blandly 
i be not a child 
of a certainty -PRON- could get the police a company of marine if -PRON- wish 
but -PRON- would be a sorrow for -PRON- monsieur to find -PRON- beautiful wife with -PRON- throat cut when -PRON- arrive with -PRON- police 
be -PRON- not so 
while -PRON- be go madame will sit here and -PRON- pistol will point at -PRON- heart 
when -PRON- return to this room i shall know instantly whether madame be to live or to die 
i can shoot very quickly monsieur 
ha ha 
-PRON- see -PRON- now -PRON- go on chuckle 
-PRON- i take no chance 
with a man alone -PRON- would be different but with the lovely lady as a forfeit i have no fear 
now go 
mrs eastman speak suddenly in a despairing wail 
give -PRON- all -PRON- have george -PRON- say 
the man be a savage 
how can -PRON- expect reason or mercy from -PRON- 
madame be endow with brain as well as beauty exclaim the outlaw 
-PRON- would be a thousand pity to spoil such beauty or to spill such excellent brain 
do not delay monsieur 
george eastman stand with clench hand -PRON- face work convulsively 
-PRON- be the first man i have ever want to kill -PRON- declare 
the outlaw shrug -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- i have no fierce emotion like that -PRON- say virtuously 
i should like to avoid kill -PRON- monsieur 
no -PRON- would not be pleasant to kill either -PRON- or madame 
eastman look at -PRON- wife long and earnestly 
-PRON- eye blaze with hot anger and resentment and -PRON- long to attack the desperado and take -PRON- chance but the piteous hopeless face of the frail woman unnerve -PRON- 
well then -PRON- say suddenly with a sigh of bitter dejection go 
but i warn -PRON- berard that if i give -PRON- the money -PRON- will not be an end of the affair 
get the money and make haste mutter the outlaw grin contentedly 
-PRON- be terrible eastman that such a crime should be commit in -PRON- house moan tournier but -PRON- be wise to yield before there be bloodshe 
-PRON- know this man and -PRON- have no mercy 
-PRON- see what -PRON- dear friend say of -PRON- exclaim the outlaw happily 
the american ignore the brute and -PRON- gun go to -PRON- wife and take -PRON- in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- whisper encouragement of a sort to -PRON- and beg -PRON- to be brave and patient in the ordeal while -PRON- go to the town and talk with the united state consul 
-PRON- may be -PRON- tell -PRON- boldly that a way would be find to circumvent the scoundrel without risk danger or disaster be a quick shot and a sure one warn berard 
be sure that i will keep -PRON- word 
eastman embrace -PRON- wife tenderly then spring away from -PRON- and walk to the door 
i shall be back in an hour if -PRON- be possible -PRON- say quietly 
if the hour stretch out too far say berard i shall take madame in -PRON- arm and console -PRON- 
i find -PRON- already grow foolish with tender emotion 
take care that i donot kill -PRON- cry eastman and step forth resolutely into the night 
without help from tourni -PRON- get -PRON- car from the shed at the rear of the inn make certain that the engine and the tire be in work order and then start at high speed for the distant town -PRON- heart beat faster than the valve of the motor 
-PRON- be late in the evening and the consul may be hard to find 
what then 
and if -PRON- be in -PRON- office could -PRON- cash the letter of credit without infinite come and go and hour of delay 
with the money secure and pay to the bandit what would the traveler do then without mean and so many thousand mile from home 
thus -PRON- mind run on in a turmoil of apprehension and excitement and -PRON- drive the motorcar over the hard white road at prodigious speed 
suddenly the throb rataplan of the engine stop and the car coast for a thousand yard under the impetus of -PRON- speed then slow down and stop 
eastman spring out and throw open the hood in a frenzy of anxiety 
there be a tense moment of inspection then the man cry out and shout at the car as though -PRON- be a living creature 
-PRON- may run again after an hour or two of laborious tinkering but in the present emergency -PRON- would not move for any man 
-PRON- shriek madly at the thing to have mercy on -PRON- and rally to -PRON- need but the machinery remain stolidly inert with a sort of grim fatality 
-PRON- hear all at once far off the faint sound of wheel and a drumming of hoof and -PRON- cry out in wild expectancy 
unable to wait -PRON- run swiftly down the road to meet the approach vehicle and when -PRON- be pant for breath and almost exhausted -PRON- come upon a twowheele native cart pony draw and occupy by a single man 
-PRON- try english word upon the wayfarer and there be an encouraging response 
turn -PRON- cart around and take -PRON- to the town and make -PRON- price what -PRON- will -PRON- gasp as soon as -PRON- could breathe 
but monsieur -PRON- be very late and -PRON- own destination be far off the driver protest courteously 
eastman explain frantically that -PRON- be the victim of a treacherous motor and that -PRON- must get to the town 
-PRON- will do well to wait until morning -PRON- be now so late advise the stranger 
there be a good inn some distance along the road and i will take -PRON- there 
but i come from that accurse place just now cry the american tell -PRON- sir -PRON- be a matter of life and death and -PRON- must take -PRON- to the town 
ah some person be very ill murmur the driver 
then that be different

i have to see the united state consul i have to get money at once money to save the life of -PRON- wife 
be that enough for -PRON- curiosity 
monsieur be excite observe the other with madden ease of manner 
but -PRON- give -PRON- a mystery to puzzle over -PRON- friend 
-PRON- be very strange that madame -PRON- wife -PRON- life may be save by money 
the situation be peculiar 
eastman swear at the man -PRON- assail -PRON- with frightful epithet and dire threat but scarcely disturb -PRON- equanimity 
but if -PRON- must have the whole story why have -PRON- then -PRON- storm 
i intend that the world shall have -PRON- tomorrow so what s the difference

if i summon the police -PRON- will kill -PRON- and if i fail to get the money -PRON- may kill -PRON- both 
now will -PRON- take -PRON- to the house of the consul 
the driver appear vastly interested but scarcely perturb 
monsieur have have no previous rience with bandit -PRON- exclaim 
but that be not strange at this day -PRON- be not so common 
eh bien monsieur -PRON- will permit -PRON- to help -PRON- as a friend 
be good enough to get up here beside -PRON-

man alive that will do no good -PRON- may be fatal 
have the goodness to follow -PRON- advice persist the stranger

-PRON- will listen to -PRON- i promise -PRON- on -PRON- oath monsieur

the man shrug -PRON- shoulder and throw back the front of -PRON- jacket expose to view the butt of a revolver that hang in a holster at -PRON- waist 
-PRON- shall meet on even term monsieur -PRON- say quietly 
vaguely bewilder and exhaust by -PRON- prolonged frenzy eastman mount to the seat of the cart reluctantly 
-PRON- start a fresh series of objection to the man proposal but the native cut -PRON- short by start the pony abruptly and whip -PRON- into a wild run fling the cart sickeningly from one side of the road to the other 
eastman clung to the side and keep -PRON- seat with difficulty and the jolting of the vehicle preclude further argument 
as -PRON- draw near the inn the driver pull the pony to an easy trot but -PRON- make no further attempt to diminish the sound of -PRON- approach 
be good enough to get down here monsieur -PRON- say presently that i may appear to be alone if i be observe 
when i reach the door and enter -PRON- may follow quickly 
eastman drop to the ground a hundred yard from the house in deep shadow and wait 
-PRON- be dumbly obedient now for there be a certain authority in the man speech and action which reassure -PRON- and give -PRON- something like hope 
-PRON- watch -PRON- mysterious friend as -PRON- drive up to the inn and get down from the cart 
-PRON- see -PRON- casually tie the horse to a post and saunter up to the door then -PRON- follow direction and scurry forward keep in the shadow 
when -PRON- reach die door -PRON- be open and there be loud voice sound from the room 
in a flash -PRON- see -PRON- friend engage with the terrible victor berard and -PRON- dart into the room and seize -PRON- sob wife in -PRON- arm 
the cartdriver hold the outlaw by the collar of -PRON- shirt with one hand and with the other hand -PRON- deal -PRON- prodigious blow across the face 
crimson welt appear where the hand rise and fall and between howl of agony the famous outlaw shriek that -PRON- nose be break 
this be the beginning announce the stranger desist for a moment

the stranger step back strike an attitude and point at the moaning outlaw derisively 
victor berard -PRON- say dramatically have be describe as a handsome man 
would any one but the unfortunate mother of this goat call -PRON- handsome 
victor enemy call -PRON- brave -PRON- go on oratorically 
could any one mistake this whimper booby for a brave man 
victor berard be outlaw and send into exile but when do -PRON- prey upon traveler and upon frail woman 
victor berard believe -PRON- may throw the palace of a prince into panic but -PRON- would not seek adventure in the parlor of an inn 
eastman utterly aghast glance curiously at toumier and -PRON- wife and be further puzzle 
the keeper of the inn be apparently quite as terrify as -PRON- have be before -PRON- face be draw and of the color of yellowed ivory 
-PRON- shrink back together close to the wall and stare at the stranger in a sort of fascination 
now resume the person of mysterious authority -PRON- shall get this canaille out of -PRON- atmosphere and -PRON- grasp the culprit again by the collar and fling -PRON- upon the floor

the cringe clown whimpering softly creep furtively toward the open door 
-PRON- gain the threshold and rise to something nearer a standing posture and then the stranger take a long stride after -PRON- and administer the world record kick propel -PRON- like a rocket through the darkness 
at the same moment the administrator of picturesque justice whip the revolver from -PRON- belt and fire a fusillade of shot into the air at random 
-PRON- hear the terrify clown run on the road a moment later run perhaps as athlete sometimes dream of running 
now -PRON- and mme

but why begin eastman

raymond ashley tke j admit that a rule of the argosy be transgress in the opening paragraph of the july complete novel 
the story do not start off with a bang this in spite of the fact that -PRON- lead -PRON- fourth of july number 
nevertheless there be a bang and -PRON- come ahead of the first paragraph 
-PRON- get -PRON- in the title author of those eye from kama why there be a murder on pearl street etc and -PRON- get -PRON- good and plenty in the story -PRON- which be all about a distinguished young novelist seek a change from work and a persistent woman who land -PRON- in the midst of happening beside which war wild alarm be almost tame 
sensational rest in short move with the rapidity of a machine gun leave the reader fairly breathless at the finish 
for those of -PRON- who like tale the july number will provide in which a trade between rich and poor lead to extraordinary complication 
the empress of the paper hoop by olin lyman be a fourth of july yarn with a circusy flavor and what happen when patriotism run counter to the call of love be set forth in there be many other rarely attractive feature in the july argosy but there s a big mail from -PRON- reader await attention so now step aside -PRON- and let -PRON- talk to one another 
i wonder if -PRON- all arenot as pleased as i be when answer be make to -PRON- request to be tell how each one come to know the argosy 
drop -PRON- a line about this 
meanwhile here a new fashion in which a fellow become acquaint with a publication that be destine to give -PRON- a great deal of pleasure 
kingman arizona 
i have just lay down the march argosy and wish to say that the february and march issue have be exceptionally enjoy 
fourforty at the fort penn be a good story which i believe i enjoy more than sam and that be say a great deal 
most magazine improve gradually but the argosy seem to come forward by leap and bound 
i note that -PRON- request in the logbook that -PRON- relate what -PRON- be that first attract -PRON- to the argosy 
in -PRON- case -PRON- be more of a case of sympathy than anything else 
in the spring of i be strand in a small town in tennessee and happen to pass a newsstand and note the arcosy story up against -PRON- i feel that if the fellow who write that story have any solution for the problem that could be apply to -PRON- case i be strong for -PRON- 
since i have miss but few number of the argosy this be due to the newsstand run out of -PRON- before i get around 
i be move most of the time and have to depend upon the newsstand instead of a regular subscription 
in all the country there be not a bunch of author that hand out as much pleasure as the argosy writer and i have no criticism to make on any of -PRON- 
edward 
here -PRON- be reader a letter that open the way for a flow of opinion from -PRON- on more than one topic 
after all not the length but the strength of a story be the thing and i do not believe in hamper the author by rule and regulation when genius burn 
a good idea this of mr as to what story each reader like best wait to hear from -PRON- 
andalusia alabama 
i enclose herewith one dollar for -PRON- renewal 
the argosy be the good ever and only one thing would cause -PRON- to quit read -PRON- and that would be to make -PRON- a weekly publication instead of monthly 
i do not have time to read a weekly magazine for i recently try that on the allstory weekly beginning with the open chapter of the matrimaniac 
this story be good and i read -PRON- all but havenot have time to read the other story in the copy that i buy 
i want to entreat -PRON- to quit draw the serial out so long 
please change -PRON- mode of print -PRON- back to the old style of three instalment each divide into three part 
three serial each month with one go out and a new one come in in each issue be in -PRON- estimation a much well way than the present method 
i realize that the serial hold subscriber but the suggestion i have offer will not interfere with this and will give the reader the entire serial while the first part be still fresh in -PRON- memory 
the present method of draw a serial out from five to seven month be objectionable because when the last be reach the first be too far away and be not clearly remember 
please take a vote on this and see if the majority of -PRON- reader do not prefer serial in three instalment 
i would like to know through the logbook just what story each reader like good 
that be just what story fit in and remind -PRON- of some part of -PRON- life 
i like the third act better than any other for the reason that -PRON- almost completely follow a certain chapter of -PRON- life 
hope that -PRON- donot forget to contract the serial be padgett 
the magic of circulationbuilding be explain in the simple act relate in the subjoined letter 
somebody like a certain story in the argosy hand -PRON- to a friend to read and presto another unit be add to the magazine clientele 
which story in the present issue say do any of -PRON- consider worth recommend to a friend 
syracuse new york 
please find enclose one dollar to pay for -PRON- renewal to the argosy which i have read for a long time 
the first argosy i remember read have a trolley tangle in -PRON- and a friend consider the story so good that the book be hand to -PRON- and i at once become an admirer of the argosy 
i always like hawkin but i will abide by the decision of the majority and forget -PRON- 
in regard to author i never notice an author name the story that count with -PRON- not the author 
hope that this escape the scrapheap i be harold gutterson 
i especially commend the subjoin to those reader who want -PRON- to abolish serial 
-PRON- be the anchor to windward that steady circulation 
without serial mr graham would very likely have wait for the march number when -PRON- find -PRON- be too late for february 
ukiah california 
enclose find ten cent worth of stamp to pay for the february argosy 
i be too late to get -PRON- from the town near which i live 
i think the argosy be about the good magazine i have read 
i have not subscribe for -PRON- yet but i intend to later 
the motive dare the danger zone and the gilded trap be very good story and as -PRON- be continue in the february arcosy be why i be so anxious to get -PRON- 
diahl graham 
mr rich run squarely counter to the preference of mr padgett in the matter of the length of serial 
november be the second issue of the present type of argosythat be to say all fiction 
seattle washington 
i have just finish read at the fort penn by perley poore sheehan in the march number of the argosy and i must say i think -PRON- be a crackerjack 
i have read a number of novel by the same author include the star of adventure and phyllis ot fountain square all good every one but fourforty at the fort penn beat -PRON- all 
i call -PRON- -PRON- masterpiece 
i be think a few day ago while read the argosy how long -PRON- have be since i first begin to read -PRON- 
-PRON- mind go back a good many year when i be a sailor on the atlantic coast 
i think -PRON- be in the summer of that i first see and read the little weekly call the golden argosy and i think -PRON- be in november that i read the argosy as a monthly 
i be in portland maine at the time and some sailor bring -PRON- aboard -PRON- ship along with other reading matter 
sailor as a rule be very fond of reading 
i read -PRON- then and i have continue to read -PRON- ever since and -PRON- grow better all the time 
i like -PRON- complete novel very well but -PRON- preference be for a long serial story the longer -PRON- be the well -PRON- suit -PRON- 
i enjoy read the logbook 
the different opinion give by the various reader be very interesting 
i read the letter of the logbook first of all then the continue story next the complete novel wind up with the short story 
for the small sum of ten cent -PRON- be certainly give -PRON- army of reader a great treat in publish a magazine up to the standard of highpriced publication 
i read all kind of magazine also fiction from the public library but i get more satisfaction out of a copy of the argosy than from any of -PRON- 
rich 
now for the man who dislike serial but in this case -PRON- have nullify -PRON- objection by subscribe so that there be no danger of -PRON- miss a number 
-PRON- make the argosy a bit old than -PRON- be by hark back to the seventy 
the first number be date december the volume be at that time yearly one 
with the increase number of page -PRON- be shift to halfyearly and when still more page be add to each monthly issue to three a year as at present in order to obviate book too bulky for easy handling 
etna wyome 
please find enclose two dollar for which please renew -PRON- subscription for one year to the arcosy and also please send the railroad magazine 
i like both of these magazine 
the only objection i can find to the argosy be too many serial 
i would be better pleased if there be no serial at all for if -PRON- miss a copy especially if -PRON- be in the completion of a story -PRON- be very annoying and out in this wild country seventy mile or more from a railroad -PRON- canot step over to a newsstand and buy -PRON- miss copy 
how any one can like serial better than complete novel i canot imagine as i canot remember what a serial be about from one month to the next 
but in -PRON- estimation the argosy be the good fiction magazine publish 
i have take -PRON- now about ten year i believe and i have read stray copy of -PRON- since -PRON- be the golden argosy back in the seventy in old missouri 
i have never subscribe to the railroad magazine but have read a good many stray copy of -PRON- 
edward lever 
a many thank to -PRON- georgia friend for tell so much in so few word 
-PRON- will note that -PRON- mention what -PRON- consider the good novel -PRON- favorite short story and the author that have appeal to -PRON- the most strongly 
these be expression of opinion very helpful to an editor and matter which i be sure -PRON- all enjoy read in the way of compare with -PRON- own idea 
bellton georgia 
would -PRON- allow a fellow letter to be print in the logbook i have no kick on the argosy at all 
i like all -PRON- story 
i think in the blue limousine southwest of the law the green lamp the trap line runner the border of blade and the great white waste in the april issue good 
but in fact i like -PRON- all 
-PRON- favorite short story that have appear in the argosy lately be and -PRON- take -PRON- in and ranch secret 
-PRON- favorite author be leniver carew seward hopkin norcross forbes rex parson katharine eggleston george cain and bedfordjone 
i be not much on the serial 
i will not miss a copy of the argosy as long as -PRON- be as good as -PRON- be now 
always on the good side of the argosy i remain jame quillian 
tell -PRON- reader how many of -PRON- hail with joy the sight of the content page when -PRON- proclaim that there be tfin short story in the number in place say of five or six 
that mean of course that either the complete novel be short or that there be not such long instalment of the serial 
the more short story of course the more variety but how many of -PRON- stop to think about this i wonder 
to comply with mr suggestion would limit the short very decidedly 
housatonic massachusetts 
enclose please find check for a year subscription to the argosy which kindly mail to -PRON- address begin with the april number 
heretofore i have buy -PRON- from the newsstand but -PRON- come at irregular date and i think i would try a year subscription and see if -PRON- do not come on the date expect 
i have not miss a copy in fifteen or eighteen year and find no other magazine that anywhere near interest -PRON- as do the good old argosy 
i hope to read -PRON- for many more year

before -PRON- cut -PRON- out i do not realize what an improvement -PRON- could be but after have every number complete i enjoy the reading so much more that now i be hold everything back until -PRON- be complete and -PRON- sometimes make tiresome waiting 
hope -PRON- may some time cut -PRON- down to at the most two or three part story i be ever and sincerely yours torrey

i save the magazine until i have all of a serial story then i read -PRON- as i would a book in one or two evening 
that way be far more satisfactory to -PRON-
