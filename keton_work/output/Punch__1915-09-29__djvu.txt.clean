Price is only one of the two factors that determine value. The other the worth of the goods offered. The real worth of cotton fabrics is measured by their actual resistance to wear or wash, and their permanency of finish. It is impossible for the public to determine these qualities except by actual service or by certain identification and positive guarantee. That is why Tootals inaugurated their famous policy of selvedgemarking, or otherwise branding their wide range of superior products, listed on this page, and of guaranteeing their real worth.

Folkestone September A System of Exercise for Everyone from Infancy to Old Age. exercise is the first step towards better health. It is what Nature prescribes to keep the body fit. Lieut. (Royal Danish Engineers) has reduced exercise to so fine a point of simplicity as almost to give a new meaning to the word. His System is exercise without drudgery. It is scientific, easy, delightful and suited to old and middle-aged persons of either sex, as well as to the young. No appliances of any kind are required. The whole series of movements occupies only a few minutes daily, and there is no risk of strain. The responsiveness of the body to the exercises is immediate, because they exercise all the vital organs and every muscle of the body. The series includes self- massage with the hands a novel feature which produces a delightful, exhilarating glow removes and prevents indigestion and constipation; promotes circulation tones the nerves and makes the skin clear and healthy. The and twisting Exercises performed without difficulty even by people unused to exercise strengthen the muscles of the trunk and massage the inner organs, ensuring functional efficiency. As a result the acids which cause gout, rheumatism and similar ailments are removed from the system. Stoutness is overcome by the discipline of the body under the Muller System, because the exercises restore the entire physical organism to its normal or natural condition of health. For the same reasons the System corrects excessive thinness. The Muller System requires no prolonged or painful effort. The movements are varied, pleasant to perform and adaptable to every degree of physical strength. It is, therefore, a method of health exercise keenly appreciated by ladies who desire a shapely and graceful figure, a clear skin and the cure by natural means of the many ailments which frequently impair the picture of health." Why this is accomplished by the practice of the Muller System is explained in a- booklet, The Royal Road to Health and Beauty," a copy of which will be sent post free to all lady enquirers. A line drawing of a photograph of Boegebjerg' life-size statue of Lieut. Muller. Personal Instruction. Tuition is given personally and privately at the Institute in bright, airy rooms. Separate instruction rooms are set apart for Ladies and Children. For those who are unable personally to visit the Institute arrangements can be made to send Instructors (lady or gentleman) to explain and teach the System in their own homes. Readers are invited to call at the (opposite Tube Station), (Telephone Regent), for a Free Consultation with Lieut. Muller. Postal Instruction. Special courses by post are conducted by Lieut. Muller to enable persons in the country and abroad to learn the exercises thoroughly, easily and quickly. Full particulars free on request. Please mention Punch, Sept. Evidence concerning the System. Dr. Glasgow: I have no hesitation in saying that no living man has done more to promote a clean, healthy life among the men and women of England than you have done. I wish you long life and strength to continue your good work of salvation by attention to the body." To sum up, the Muller System is undoubtedly an all-round comprehensive method of regularly exercising every;, muscle of the body in a minimum amount of time, and that, briefly, spells de writing in The Daily Mail": After three months' regular discipline discipline, mind you, accessible to every man a man's body changes almost beyond belief. Do it, and you will see. Do it for the sake of your health and the health of your children, and your children's children. Do it for the sake of England, who wants tough, healthy men." Lieutenant Muller is a good advertisement of his system, for he has a fine wellproportioned figure his muscles are not developed to excess, and it would not be difficult to find many young men in the Army or at the Universities of larger muscular proportions." "There is no terrible development of thigh or biceps. You are only supple and upright only healthier and happier, less cross and less nervous, only nicer to live with cleaner, pluckier and more self-confident." It is essentially a system of home gymnastics suitable for all ages of men and women. It is simplicity itself, and a very slight acquaintanceship will convince those who try it of the benefit to be derived from it. It should be introduced into every school, and we should like to say every family, in England." the well-known Swedish Ladies' Magazine Most earnestly do we recommend Lieut. System to the whole world of women. Daily baths, systematic exercises and massage, and exposure to fresh air and sunshine are not only means to health but also to beauty and natural vivacity." Sir One becomes fit and keeps fit by carrying out Lieut. System, which is a natural course of exercises without the use of muscle-straining instruments, causing no great strain and resulting in no aftercollapse." Dr. in his work Indigestion, its Cause and Cure The Muller exercises are probably the best devised for remedying constipation and indigestion."

We note with interest this confirmation of the belief that the Kaiser fights with shadows.

Aa indent is a wondrously perfected device for whitening the hair of the officer involved."- Mr. Arnold Bennett in "The Daily News."] Lieut, and Acting-Quartermaster Denton- Smy the sat in his office prepared for the nerve-racking process of filling in the daily indent. Summoning up that courage which is instinctive in the British officer, he opened Army Book and wrote the name of his unit, Bty. 999th Bde. on the top line. Without resting after the mental strain involved he filled in the word One in the space for No. of day's rations required and again, without pause, filled in the date, Sept. 20th," in the space for Date when rations are required." Many men would have taken a rest at this point, but Lieut. Denton- Smy the was made of sterner stuff. He only paused long enough to dip his pen in the ink and then entered the number in the space for No. of officers, warrant officers, non-com. officers and men," and the number in the space for No. of rations required." The unflinching sense of duty which characterises our officers was never better exemplified than in the 'case of Lieut. Denton- Siny the. Even after the exhausting mental effort required to calculate that men would require rations he would not yield to exhaustion. Again dipping his pen in the ink with the same determination with which he would have thrust a bayonet through a German, he put the number in the space provided on the form for "No. of horses;" and again, with no outward sign of brain fatigue, he calculated the number of rations required for horses and entered the number in the space provided. Then, gathering together what remained of his superb energy, he signed his name at the foot of the document and laid down his pen. Here one would like to he able to say that he was free to rest to go on leave for a week, and, attended by loving members of bis family, or by one even dearer than they, to recuperate his jaded brain and shattered tissues. But the Army regulations are callous, and no such happy ending is possible, unless we tamper with truth. The gallant officer had laid down his pen, but his task was still incomplete. He had yet to detach the indent from the book. This done he rose and, with a supreme effort, opened the door and said, "Corporal, send this to the Supply Office." Then he collapsed. Concerning the multitudinous charms and stately sweetnesses of Audrey, much might be written, but as this is to be an article, as opposed to a book, and as young goddesses, being but human, may be spoilt by a too candid worship, I will here confine myself to her single fault. Audrey is romantic, nay more, she is mediaeval. When recently I approached her with a certain momentous question, she was fresh from versions of the Tristram and Iseult" legend, and to say that she was full of it is to put the case feebly. The sick lover was to infer, you remember, from the white or black sail on the good ship Sivan whether his affaire was going smoothly or quashed for ever and Audrey proposed to tell me my fate by a modernised treatment of the idea. After a clear week for reflection, she would meet me by appointment, and if she came clad in brilliant hues I might go to the jewellers' at once for the ring; but if the tints of her attire were "neutral" all would be over, and I could interview the chemist, with an order for strychnine, at my earliest convenience. The fateful night arrived, and ensemble flung me into mingled triumph and despair. Even to my dull masculine eyes the run of her tints was appallingly neutral but there was one solitary gleam of hope. She wore on her breast a screaming red rosette which would have spoilt the beauty of any ordinary girl. Poor tongue-tied coward, I lacked the nerve to insist on an answer outright, and we proceeded with the agenda of the evening, which consisted of a theatre, a modest and a taxi home. I trust never again to pass through such torments of doubt and suspense. At last, as we stood on the steps of The Lindens," where Audrey dwells, I could no longer silence my anguish. Tell me, dearest," I whispered, hoarse with emotion, tell me, and put me out of my pain. Are these tints to be taken as brilliant or neutral "You silly boy," she replied, "as if I could dress in bright colours Why, you can't get anything in that line fit to make up for love or money A great wave of hope surged over me. But this thing," I cried, pointing to the scarlet abomination on her breast, it means Sh she whispered. It 's a dead secret, and papa would disinherit me if he found out. I stole his Civic Volunteer brassard and made a temporary rosette of it. That seemed the handiest way to show what I mean My memory has as yet failed to reconstruct fully the next whirling moment, but it is thought, from the undeniable dustiness of my knees on the following morning, that I behaved in the best sixteenth- century style.

A masterly series of two nursery cannons, varied sometimes by (and very occasionally coupled with) a hazard is all I aspire to. Petherby, on the other hand, can generally manage to score something every time, and not infrequently runs into some of the humbler double figures. The truth, is that I do not possess the discriminating eye of a Digglb for the niceties of angles. But I have one facility of which I am proud and to which I shall allude later. A few weeks ago, at house, I found him in one of his rare off moods. These off moods of his generally signify that he beats me by a mere or so in up, instead of by the more customary margin of or more. But on the night in question Petherby was playing so shockingly and I so brilliantly (on two successive visits to the table I had played for safety and scored a clear board each time), that at length I was to his It was my turn to play. My first stroke, though not exactly yielding the result I had in mind, was nevertheless a most satisfactory and comprehensive one. I made a cannon off the red, and then my ball and mysteriously disappeared down different pockets. Petherby applauded with the butt of his cue upon the floor. "Good shot, Sir!" he remarked sarcastically. "What a pity it didn't all come off'!"' "All come off I said with hauteur. "Why, it did all come off much better than I could have hoped for even in my most sanguine moments. What do you mean the red to have done something— gone down a pocket, for instance Then you would have won the game. As it is Petherby," I said sternly, remember, please, that there are three balls, six pockets, and certain laws of coincidence which must operate at times. In that stroke I distinctly see the finger of Providence. You are not intended to win this game. Just look at the position of the red." The red was up the table close to the left cushion. To pot it was an impossibility as far as my limited technique was concerned, but I felt that by careful aiming (so as to hit the paint without disturbing the ivory, as I expressively put it when narrating the incident to Pilkington) I could manage to run in. So I took a deliberate aim and pressed my cue gently forward. Slowly, slowly my ball trickled up the table, straight as a die all the way. It was only a few inches from the red and still running true when the electric lights went out. At the same instant a loud report was heard, followed immediately by a second and third. Zepps cried Petherby. Where 's my umbrella? There 's other game afoot," I cried, as I fumbled for my cigarette-lighter. The wick flamed up. I hurried to the top of the table. My ball was in "Get back Belgium? Get it back? You wait till yon chaps campin' oh the 'ill gets out there If they can't get it back no other way they 'll pinor it the pocket. "Hurrah!" I shouted joyfully. Game to me "On the contrary," said Petherby, craning his neck over my shoulder, it 's my game. You 've given three away That red 's never budged a hair's-breadth, I swear." Bot I retorted. I couldn't possibly have missed. I was dead on the edge of the red when the lights went out." Can you solemnly affirm you heard the balls click? "Of course not, you ass," I replied. "How could I through that beastly firing? On the other hand, did you see me miss "How could I in the dark?" he answered testily. Exactly," I said. I couldn't hear; you couldn't see. As you maintain that the red hasn't moved, the fairest thing will be for me to play the shot again. Bo you happen to have a candle on you There was a knock at the door and the servant entered. If you please, Sir," she said, the police sergeant has just been, and said you're wanted at once at the station." I must go immediately," said Petherby, struggling into his jacket. What a nuisance these Zepp raids are, interfering with one's amusements in this way Eeally, I Half a jiffy I cried as Petherby moved to the door. Wait while I play that shot again. Anybody would think there was a panic from your positively indecent haste." "Sorry," said Petherby., edging off, but duty is duty. Where would my crest of five oysters rampant gules on a plat du jour argent be if my knightly ancestors had preferred billiards to duty? So long!" There 's a precedent for it," I retorted. How about game of bowls But Petherby was halfway down the staircase. Shirker!" I yelled after him as I realised that the issue must remain undecided. But I said, "would you take this lighter and hold it close to the red ball so Now, I want you to watch the red ball carefully and tell me if this white one, which I am going to play, touches it." I placed my own ball back in baulk, took a long and careful aim, and then somehow I managed to miscue. No, Sir, it didn't hit the red one," said Mary, as my ball stopped a few inghes from the baulk-line. I pretended to heave a sigh of relief. Thank goodness I exclaimed. "Properly to explain the objoct and effect of that stroke, Mary, would necessitate my using technicalities which you would probably not understand. I think, under the circumstances, you had better not mention to Mr. Petherby that I required your assistance. He might consider it an abuse of his hospitality." Very good, Sir," said Mary as she exchanged the cigarette lighter for half-a-crown.

September The Mistake. There is no need to specify the restaurant. It is famous for its English joints, and is just now much visited by officers on leave who wish to eat together, just as a certain subterranean grill-room is the favourite resort of officers on leave when, as not infrequently happens, they entertain the other sex. To one of the tables, thoughtfully provided with so many chairs that secrets have ever been out c"f the question here, came two lieutenants, very obviously oil' duty for a brief season and rejoicing in their liberty and he who was acting as host, and bad long since settled all doubts as to what their meal was to consist of, flung out the order for roast beef almost before he was seated flung ib out too as though expecting as instant a response from the stall' as he gets from his men, all unmindful that this restaurant has leisurely processes of its own, carefully acquired and perfected during many, many years. Meanwhile the saddle of mutton was wheeled to my side and some unusuallyattractive slices were separated from it by a knife like a razor and laid before me. I saw the lieutenants eyeing my plate with ill-concealed enw but beef was in their minds. Beef had been in their minds for toilsome weeks, and they did not betray their friend. At least not wholly, but I fancy the host wavered. wonder," he began, and said no more, for the beef arrived on its little wagon, and their plates were soon covered with it. It was not one of the most successful of the house's joints, and again I caught their eyes directed towards my saddle. Was it too late their expression silently asked. Yes, it was. Besides, they had come there to eat beef. Nothing like beef The lieutenants attacked with vigour, but they still glanced muttonwards now and then, meditatively, between bites. Then the host spoke. It was in an undertone, hut I heard, because at this restaurant, as I have said, there are no secrets. wonder if we oughtn't to have bad saddle," he murmured. "It looks jolly good," said the other.

Matilda rather misled me on the question of buying meat. She said that, there was no particular trick about it that all you have to do is to go to a place where they sell meat and buy it, taking care that you get the right weight and that the man does not throw too much bone and bits of sheep's head and cow's feet on the scale. She said that a purveyor of meat is easily identified because he wears a peculiar blue costume and that the only other person you can possibly mistake for him is a wounded soldier. I got into the right kind of place first time and said, I should like to see some meat." The man didn't take any notice of me until he had finished cutting off and wrapping up in newspaper a lump of meat for a ready-money customer. Then he said, "What kind of meat "Beef and mutton and such like things." The butcher affectionately slapped the piece of meat which he had been carving and said, a nice piece, of steak." How much meat have you got there? I asked. About five pounds I weigh it for you." think I shall want rather more than that." He fetched down quite a largo piece of meat off a hook, weighed it, and said it was twenty-two pounds. I was thinking of buying a larger piece than that," I said. How much was you wanting "The piece I had in mind should weigh between three and four thousand pounds." The eager look which came into his eyes was quickly succeeded by something akin to fear as he went to the door to make sure the policeman was taking his usual afternoon nap in the neighbourhood. If you was wanting to buy meat, I can sell it you, but if you was looking for a flock of sheep or a herd of oxen, I admit I haven't got 'em in stock." don't necessarily ant to take it all with me," I said. What with my boy leaving me and my assistant joining the Army, I haven't got time to waste joking. Perhaps you was thinking of giving a party No I wasn't I just wanted some meat, but I see you aren't accustomed to serve large families and I 'd better try elsewhere. I suppose it "s possible to buy meat for a battalion somewhere in this town." "If you want to buy meat for the Army you have to go to the meat market." The meat market is a dull place the mention of thousands of pounds of meat doesn't excite the inhabitants in the least, and they were rather bored with my little order however, they condescended to deliver the stuff for me after totting it up in sheep and oxen. In spite of the fact that I had the vinegar and more than one kind of meat, both Matilda and the Quartermaster-Sergeant thought that the men would expect a still greater variety, and under protest I added a few things like bread, jam and cheese. I avoided small tradesmen in making these purchases, as they are so suspicious, and only dealt with people who had the capital to carry a decent-sized stock. When the War Office heard about the things that Matilda and the Quartermaster-Sergeant had persuaded me to buy they naturally got jealous and started sending out circulars to say that they weren't going to put up with any competition with their camps and that all camps without their name, on were spurious and contrary to law. Of course I didn't worry about the War Office because I know that their printed circulars don't mean anything and are only sent out to do the printers and the post-office a turn, but the Adjutant and our Commandant (who is in the regular army and doesn't understand War Office humour) seemed to think that we ought to scratch the camp. They got the idea that I had let myself into some kind of a mess by what they were pleased to term my premature purchase of goods, and the idea seemed to amuse them until I explained that I had bought all the goods in their names and that when the Corps funds were exhausted they would be personally responsible for the balance. So they went to talk to the War Office about it, and met all the other Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants up there on the same errand. When the War Office found how unpopular their circular had made them, and how they couldn't move about without falling over Volunteer Commandants and Adjutants, they said they didn't object to camps being held if the of the various districts didn't object. Some people, who took the War Office literally, wrote to the of the respective districts where they proposed to camp and got leave, which was then cancelled by the War Office. For myself, I took no such risk and as neither the War Office nor the of any district found out about our camp we didn't do ■any harm to anyone but ourselves, and we only caught little things like rheumatism and indigestion. If anyone does find out about it I shall apologise for my mistake and trust to his being too busy to do anything further in the matter. The camp was rather a success we got most of the tents to stand up and some of them kept the rain out, including those that mattered mean, of course, mine and and the By marking all the things Goods for Troops I persuaded the railway company to deliver most of our provender in the belief that they were helping the Government, who are among their best- customers in these days. I showed the Government mark on the tents to the railway people, and they weren't to 'know, any more than I was when I bought them, that it was the condemned mark. The vinegar didn't go so well as I had expected and I had a good deal left on my hands in spite of the fact that I got quite a lot off in the shape of claret-cup, which I retailed in the canteen. Some of the meat rounded on me and was accorded a military funeral, but not enough to make a fuss about. I had' to pledge locally what'was left of the and the credit to make up for the unused vinegar and defective meat, but there has been no trouble on that score up to now as they won't know about it until the bills come in, and by that time I shall either be on permanent leave or else have enlisted.

I defy anyone to feel nautical in a service dress jacket, martial in a life-belt, or amphibious in ammunition boots. Martial is my short suit at the moment.

September (Extracted prom ihb Diary os Toby, House of Commons, Tuesday, 21st September.— Introducing his first Budget scored a double record. In respect both of income and expenditure he had to deal with the biggest of a long list. The speech expounding it was the briefest. Marshalling a multitude of figures, from the extra halfpenny in the pound in the price of sugar up to the million pounds representing estimated expenditure of the year, his mastery of facts was so complete, his explanation so lucid, that the story was as easy to follow as an ordinary nursery tale. Time was during the prime of Gladstone at the Treasury, and with his successors in later years, when exposition of a Budget was regarded as opportunity for a great oratorical feat. Mr. thought nothing of occupying five hours, finishing up with a peroration almost worth an additional penny in the pound on the income tax. No self-respecting Chancellor of the old school would think of omitting to deck his business statement with a classical quotation, much appreciated below the Gangway. This habit led to first step in downfall of Bob Lowe. Allured by the tag, Ex luce lucellum, he invented a tax upon matches with intent to label the boxes with the motto. In the end, as everyone knows, he had to remodel his Budget, leaving out the obnoxious tax, label and all. speech began without exordium, finished without peroration, and no single sentence rose above the Spartan simplicity of the Multiplication Table. Only approach to departure from this level was when he mentioned the dizzy height at which expenditure now flies. He thereupon declared his confidence that House .and country were prepared to support the Government in bearing whatever measure of taxation is deemed necessary now, and," he ominously added, "in the future," for the successful prosecution of the War. A hearty cheer confirmed this assurance. Cheerfulness was indeed the prevailing note of historic occasion. Fresh burden of taxation imposed enormous. Affects every class, from the consumer of half-ounces of tea and quartersof- a -pound of sugar to the hapless millionaire who out of his modest income of a hundred thousand pounds a year will be called upon to contribute to the State the sum of more than one-third of the whole. This, of course, in addition to his share of indirect taxation. As the Member for Sark says, Lloyd George chastised the taxpayer with whips lays on with scorpions. And yet no murmur is heard. In November last Lloyd George imposed fresh taxation estimated to bring in a revenue of millions. On the top of that levies new taxes, which in a full effective year will increase the revenue by little short of millions.

The telegraph boy told Jimmy as he was bringing the .telegram he was coming by the three o'clock train the telegraph boy said, Uncle is a Colonel didn't I tell you'? and mother hadn't seen him for years and years, and longer than that, Jimmy says not since she was in India. Uncle used to know father quite well, because you see they had been brothers, and Uncle knew all about father winning the Victoria Cross in India but you haven't got to talk about that or Jimmy will fight you really, I mean, not pretend. Jimmy says his Uncle has got a piece of shrapnel in him, and they won't let him stay at the Front, because it hasn't burst yet, and that 's why he is coming to see his mother, Jimmy says the shrapnel might burst at any time, and then it would blow a hole ten feet deep in the ground, but it would ease his Uncle because he has to walk very quietly and not get excited now. It 's because of the time fuse they put in them, Jimmy says, and you can hear it ticking. It makes his Uncle very wary, and he has to avoid certain things at mealtimes which are not easily digested because the doctor says the shrapnel is quite enough. Jimmy has seen the porter at the station, and he has promised to stop the train you do it by the by-laws, Jimmy says. Jimmy told the porter he expected his Uncle would give him some rupees if he looked after the luggage well, and the porter took Jimmy to see his he grew them" in a plot of ground quite close to the line when he wasn't busy cleaning the station lamps. He asked Jimmy if his Uncle soaked his in paraffin before sowing— you do it because of the sparrers. The porter knew all about India he told Jimmy that out there lived on rice pudding, and it was very hot there because of the degrees of longitude, which were very warm in those parts. The porter hadn't been there, not himself, but he had read a good deal when he wasn't busy cleaning the station lamps. He said he 'd often thought about India because he couldn't abear rice pudding. He said Jimmy might safely leave his Uncle to him. Jimmy went to bed early so as to give the next day a chance. His mother nearly spoilt the day before it came because she put out his best sailor suit for him to wear and gave him three pennies to have in his pocket but not to spend. He said his Uncle would think it was Sunday, and he put his head under the bedclothes to show what he thought of her. However, he let her hold his hand tight for an hour and ten minutes before he went to sleep, and when she came to look at him some time later he only smiled in his sleep when she gently removed his feet from the pillow and placed his head there once more. It took the day a long time to break, and Jimmy was glad when he heard the birds tidying up to get ready for it. He looked out of the window the day seemed very damp and as if it wanted airing, so he got back to bed. It was eight o'clock, and the day was up and dressed and being busy when he next awoke.

Jimmy says his Uncle looked very fierce when he arrived at the station and saw his mother. It made his mother cry, and she wouldn't speak to him, and that only made his Uncle grow fiercer and redder in the face. Jimmy says he thought the shrapnel was going to burst. Jimmy says his Uncle didn't take any notice of him, although he kept on saluting him as hard as he could. Then his Uncle turned on him and glared at him and asked him what the dickens he meant standing there looking so much like his'father. Jimmy said it made his mother very angry, and she said, Tom, don't," and cried worse than ever. Jimmy says he clenched his fists and was going to give his Uncle the coward's blow when his Uncle turned his back on him and told the porter not to stand scratching his head like an idiot. Jimmy says the porter was only saluting all the time but he wasn't used to it, and every time he got his hand to his head he forgot what he set out to do and scratched his head instead. Jimmy says they drove home in a cab, and neither his Uncle nor his mother said a word to each other all the way, they were so cross. Jimmy says his Uncle had a bad cold and kept blowing his nose, and every time he did it the cab-horse gave a jump. Jimmy says his Uncle behaved better after tea. He wasn't so fierce, so he asked him to show him his wound, but his Uncle said it was under his binder and he couldn't. After the tea-things had been put away they all three went into the drawing-room to look at the large framed photograph of father. Jimmy says they each held one of his hands, and he had to bite his lip because they hurt. Jimmy says his Uncle didn't think much of the photograph. He just said He was a man, Mary, a man then he went very annoyed in the face, clicked his heels, saluted very hard and turned away. Jimmy says it made him feel quite angry with his Uncle, and he went and climbed up on the top of the coalhouse in his best clothes on purpose and he wouldn't come down until his Uncle had promised to be good and not to make his mother cry. Jimmy says his Uncle gave him his word as an officer, and they got on better after that. Jimmy said his prayers to his Uncle that night, and he let him know what he thought of him. He asked that his Uncle might be made a -better man. His mother said, "Oh, Jimmy!" but his Uncle understood, for he said, Amen to that, old chap (The newspapers have published accounts of the satisfactory results of planting tobacco in Hampshire.)

I [Septembeb He was a small stout round man, with bulging eyes and loose moist lips, evidently an inquisitive gossipy fellow, and he had been talking (very optimistically) about the War and (very pessimistically) about the taxation, fortifying himself, as he proceeded, with quotations from the daily papers, of which he had purchased every available specimen. I could see that he was dying to tell me all about himself, and at last out it came. He looked furtively round the railway compartment, as if to assure himself that nobody was lurking in the rack or under the seats, and spoke. I presume," he said, that you don't know who I really am Ho," I said, I don't. I haven't got beyond classing you as a friendly traveller." Thanks," he said but I didn't mean that. Of course I don't want to push it on you. I only wondered if you 'd got any idea of what my work in life is. It 's a unique business and keeps me hard at work, I can tell you. Look here he produced one of his papers and pointed out to me Mr. Lloyd letter— "what do you think of that?" Very telling," I said distinguished by all the fire and eloquence and innocence for which is famous." Yes," he said, it 's a pretty thing. "Well, that 's me." How do you mean that 's me you see it's written 'to a constituent'? Well, I 'm the constituent." "My dear Sir," I cried, congratulate you. To be a Welshman is a great thing to live in Carnarvon is a gift from heaven and to be a constituent of the Minister of Munitions must be the summit of earthly felicity," and I seized his hand and shook it warmly. Lord love you," he said, disengaging himself, how you do jump at conclusions no Welshman I 've never been near Carnarvon and of course, in a technical sense, I 'm not a constituent of Lloyd I 'm an accommodation constituent, that 's all.

"When one of these big bugs wants to explain something or have a whack at somebody and there's a hurry about it, he doesn't wait until his next speech. He just gets down and writes a letter. But the letter must be written to somebody—you can't sit down and begin My dear Sir with any conviction unless there 's a real 'dear Sir' somewhere at the back of it all, and that's where I come in. I lend just the necessary amount of reality to the whole thing." Have you been at the business long I said. Ever since I left school. It 's been handed down in our family from father to son for years and years. My own youngster's just started in the Midland Members of Parliament department. He 's showing a lot of promise.

I don't quite see," I said, where you make your profits." Oh, that 's easy. We get the originals of the letters, and after a time we sell them, mostly in America. There 's a big market for that sort of thing there. Of course the prices don't run quite so high since type-writers came in, but it 's fairly steady all the same. Anyhow, it keeps me in beef and beer and pudding, and you can't want more than that, can you Actually, of course, I could but at this moment we drew up at Paddington and I left it at that. A can save by having fewer changes of costume and by spending less on golfing or holiday suits, or other clothes for occasional wear by having their suits and overcoats cleaned and repaired instead of buying new ones by spending less on gloves and ties, and by having still serviceable boots mended instead of buying new ones."—" Why we must Save, and Sow." Parliamentary Savings Committee.'] In tranquil ante-bellum days, when ordering a suit Involved no fiscal problems that were serious or acute, My wardrobe was a constant source of family dispute. Against my passion for old clothes my estimable wife, Supported by my daughters, waged. a never-ending strife; It was, indeed, almost the only worry of my life. They used to hide away my old unfashionable tweeds, Oblivious of my comfort and regardless of my neads They banned my pipe, but never once objected to my weeds. My ancient ties of faded dyes excited their disdain My threadbare dinner-jacket caused them veritable pain And they criticised my boots in language less polite than plain. They heaped sarcastic obloquy upon my caps and hats They made me birthday presents of the most expensive spats, And the latest thing in handkerchiefs, in collars and cravats. In short in ways they diligently "biffed" My laudable intentions to promote domestic thrift, Until the struggle threatened to produce a serious rift. But War, though vilely fruitful in sorrow and distress, For one small salutary change I am inclined to bless At last I am allowed a perfect latitude in dress. My ancient clothes, misshapen boots, disreputable ties No longer find disfavour in my wife's and daughters' eyes, But, on the contrary, evoke their warmest eulogies. Nay, better still, themselves released from giddy goad, They follow me with docile steps along the frugal road That leads to perfect freedom from the tyranny of Mode. Retreats for Army Chaplains.

Proprietor of Cinema,. "Yes! And my business ruined by these Huns giving a fbee show op their own." (By Mr. Staff of Learned Clerks.) I take it that Mr. Maurice Hewlett designed his new Dovel The Little Iliad (Heinemann) frankly as a grotesque, an opinion in which four exceedingly quaint illustrations by Sir Philip Burne-Jones distinctly confirm me. The story is in quito an original, vein, the interest and mystery very adroitly sustained. We are given a gruesome picture of a physically wrecked but still indomitable sensualist, deplorably dragging shuffling feet a Baron von Broderodc, married to a very beautiful and gracious woman who had been caught young from out a convent. Enter Sector an egregious sentimentalist, heir incidentally of a Highland chieftain. He diagnoses an Andromeda -dragon situation, a thought which apparently had not occurred to the Baroness, who however cordially accepts the suggestion and is made profoundly -miserable. Eventually she flies and finds asylum at the head-quarters of the Malleson clan, where three other sons of the house, as also the old chieftain himself, fall hopelessly in love with her. Comes the relentless Baron in pursuit and how this modern Menelaus first wins, then loses the game, and where the fair Helena finally bestows her widowed hand, I must leave Mr. diverting little Iliad to inform you. I can promise you good entertainment and though, as I have hinted, the thing is planned in a freakish mood the author has not let himself off the honest labour of construction and polish. His sympathies are throughout with his wicked Baron, who is a very new version of the strong silent hero, and may fairly be considered a sport. What I refuse to believe about him is that, even though he shot from a pony cart, he got his gun up like lightning and fired at the instant," considering the painful struggles he bad to get his wine-glass or cigar accurately to his mouth pathological details that Mr. Hewlett has been at pains to rub well in. Something will really have to be done about it. If many more of our novelists take to turning out these prodigiously long stories, we reviewers will have to agitate for payment by piece-work. The latest exponent of the gentle art of garrulity is Mr. Temple Thurston, with his new novel, The Achievement of Bichard Furlong (Chapman and Hall) There are seven hundred and twenty-eight pages of it, so that when you have turned the last of them you may perhaps feel that the achievement is not exclusively confined to the hero. Bichard Furlong was a painter and etcher, and the object of Mr. Thurston is to trace his progress from obscurity to fame but, though he is represented as doing a lot of artistic work in bis spare time, it would be more fair to say that the real successes of Bichard were gained in the domain of what I might call (wishing to put the matter as delicately as possible) unceremonious polygamy. Erom the moment when he runs away from the paternal mill, and joins the company of Mr. other heroes in a picturesque slum-existence round about Drury Lane, his career becomes a sentimental journey from one affair to another. I don't want to say that there are [September not pleasant passages in the book there is always a certain jollity in a tale of success bub I do think that justice could have been done to the theme in a smaller compass. In his preface Mr. Thurston tells how he came to abandon his intontion of publishing three separate books about Richard history, and to bind them instead into one volume. My only comment on this is that it remains true that three of his furlongs make at least a mile. During the last twenty years Sir Gilbert Parker has -written a dozen novels. At such a stage fancy is accustomed to flag, and kind -hearted friends are apt to regret that the author has "written himself out." This makes more pleasant the discovery that in The Money Master (Hutchinson) Sir Gilbert surpasses himself. The story opens with the introduction of Jean Jacques Barbille, miller and money master, a commonplace man inclined to vanity, buzzing with consciousness of worldly prosperity built up by himself. On a voyage homewardbound from Europe where he was disappointed hen he entered Notre Dame, or a great building like the Law Courts at Eouen that people didn't whisper to each other, Here comes Jean Jacques Barbille"— he made the acquaintance of a Spanish beauty, a slim and long-limbed Diana." He married her, or, to be precise, it was she who married him, for a comfortable home and relief from penury shared with a scamp of a father. The Reader, a student of human nature with mature knowledge of its frailties, knows at once what will happen. The beautiful sensuous Carmen, bored with the dulness of daily life in company with Jean Jacques, early succumbing, will go off with another man. The Reader is right. What he does not yet know, but should take the earliest opportunity of learning, is with what masterful skill, with what touches of pathos, the dull man, miller and general dealer, his dross purified in the fire of adversity, is slowly, step by step, transformed into a hero of sublime unselfishness. Nearly every page of the story, certainly every chapter, reveals the inventive resources of the author. These never fail, and the reader is, with growing interest, hurried on to the unexpected denouement. The -world of Jean Jacques, a village which the censor may permit reference to as somewhere in the neighbourhood" of Quebec, is peopled with a diversity of characters whose acquaintance and environment are refreshing after a long course of ordinary novels. A grievance that the American has against Englishmen is that they pay visits to his country and then try to put it all into a single book. He holds that America is too large a thing to be put into a single book. Yet in Turmoil odder and Stoughton) Booth Tarkington has come very near succeeding in this feat. Turmoil, for all that it has only three hundred and twelve pages, covers the whole one side and that the most characteristic side of American life. It puts into words better than anyone has ever done before the American ideal of Bigness— its obvious faults and its less obvious merits. We must be Bigger Bigger! Bigger! Get people here Coax them here! Swindle them into coming Deafen them into coming Any kind of people! Blow! Boost! Brag! We must be Bigger! We want Bigness That was the motto of the tow in which Bibbs Sheridan lived, and it was the motto of James Sheridan, his father and Bibbs, by nature a poet and a dreamer of dreams, found himself forced by circumstances to kill his dreams and plunge in and blow and boost and brag with the rest, until at length there came to hearten him the realization that, hidden beneath all the boosting and bigness, there was a certain something that was also poetry of a kind. In the United States, Turmoil has had a vogue that recalls the days of the old best-sellers, those strange productions which it resembles only in its popularity. It is easily the best novel that Mr. Tarkington has written. Thero are flashes of the humour that illumined his Penrod stories, but for the most part the author is grimly in earnest, as befits his theme. It is a story to be read by all who would understand the soul of the country that has produced sky-scrapers and Pittsburg and the Chicago slaughter-houses. "Man alive! this is country, and a blind man couldn't help seein' it You certainly stand up for your own town, if you stick to sayin' you 'd rather live there than you would here. You sure are some patriot to say that— after you 've seen our city. I show you something now that'll make your eyes stick out." Thus Mr. James Sheridan to a European visitor, and that is America in a nutshell. The man who says, 'have it ok the worst There is real stuff as opposed to stuffing in Miss Willcocks' Change (Hutchinson). In truth her material is better than her pattern, which is rather casual and formless. She loaves loose threads, abandons even promising beginnings, certainly crowds her embroidery frame with too many figures. But you read her story and comment without skipping, get pleasure of her characters, who really seem to be alive and doing, and answer for it) you be willing to put up with little defects of form for sake of such fine substance as the patient and indirect wooing of little brown Bess Latimer, the orphan, by the Professor a charming piece of delicate romance. There is a background of Starrs, folk whose blood was older and bluer than their purses were long, and who were a little too conscious of other people's essential inferiority. It is part of the defect of Miss Willcocks' method that one can't make out just what the chango was which one supposes from her title to be the motive of her work.
