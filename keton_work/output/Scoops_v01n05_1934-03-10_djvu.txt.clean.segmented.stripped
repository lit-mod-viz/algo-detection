georges i a voice from somewhere in
be house yelled back comment f all right cried baldy
a scrap in the street
the coppers liave gone spoke ho language of gic inilcr btnilavards and jimmy did not understand a single word bu eaiil but be na able to nppreriata the reply of which was short and easy ban whereupon 
timmy gently pulled baldy to the oncu morn and sacked him as viriously as be lisd eocked the slayer of mile gevault
ho left baldy ia the street to be pickeil up by the police and provide tluio with a dual mystery and he gently closed the door luid stood alone in tho dim light of the rather intpoiing and wide entrance passageway it wss na he stood thus tlml he hoard a voice
the voice was singiug
at toast the of the voice would probably have liad the aiidscity to call it singing
actually it auundod liko an electric tram taking steep curve
it sang a song to a woliknowc tune a song that was snng when jimmy was piattlmg nurspiy rhymes
a bit of oldsoldier stuff ing down tire stair and jiiuniy enutioasly crept that way n ascended a storey or two and hepiened un tha scene of battle
a man was sitting auainst the wall on the lauding jimmy rcacnetf

he probably gamed it to be tlir istti anotlier muu canio sta stairs holding tiis head tliraiigh the air ftoai above was the scat of a ebair

mr bilks voice lifted high is calbd sickening thud reached a iimij rolled right clowa the flight of stairs and stopped only bemuse ho reached tha bottom lie ley eprcsdeagled
wltut mr bilks wes up to limiiiy did not know but that he was up to something woe diminv piuieu out guu and fired it ihre times in rspid the ueitiug of the luudiog
instantly the war above ceased war beluw iwgau
tlio attacker canie down the stair
jimmy no desire to shoot a umn with an antouulic pistol
it is alter all the wtsapoo of the coward and the hired killer
there were only itireo of them for bilim bud aiready accounted fnr the other three
they saw jimmy aod came at him
but itelp vraa on side help from aloft
ho heard a trcmcnduiu aud yell
and mr illlks was coming aiwii the stairs swinging a strargo but deadly weapon nothing less than one of the two aliorter nietai pans of tho frame of bu iron tedelcad it was a club of tha most deadly description and jimmy began to iinderalond lie really had hud no need to ml
bilk who vranted reselling were mr bilks they had a siikeniag tlmo there and them the trou weapon smashed one of them to the floor
jinuny honked the gun mail cleanly tn a kaockoiit before he could pull a trigger third man put up his arms nnd sobbed for mercy

he went over lo the cabiu window and out

the voice apuke from the radio itiacliine as clear the knrth ship wruping all ys ncroi ding to ptau

the two roou lying on tbe cabin floor were still inoliuiilew but a lie bent dawn over peter phillip tiiougtit liu saw the yomig journalists eyes flirker
then he gasped

he stopp abruptly as the big ship a violent liireh and he looked snxioi
then there came a nninbei of splntioi nliies from under the floor of the cabin
to crown llieir misfortune the rockets nuufiring

phillip read more quickly nuvv of the uisl four sviilche should millify nny radium rays and the other two will enbin with toy mixture nitrogen and the secret chemical laitor mixture should undo any liarm cauned by martiau rajs now iioive in ida heart phillip looked around the cabin for the itaelf

two more found tlio range a second later nd even while was fumbling is i1k box which was really nothing mom than a hiiy ninre of tho ileiuily yellow bcocu pierced through tha csihin window

iben ju6t as suddenly the yellow glore in the eabin breatneti again worked worked he went to tho cabin window and looked out

juichly ha pushed the lever forward ami llien drugged it itack
tills lime no reports came from the tho cylinders were probably ho was for it now hed probably before he renched the sea
suddenly llie speed of iiis desciinl a low huiimiing noise had started umlcriiaath tlte car it seemed lo joliii some rt of helicopter doiihtlwcs this vtsji a safety which operated aiitomaticaily when the cars altitude dropped loo low
john sl siill widoeyed
tliere was be coold do bul wait
hvsror uud missing the police car by inches the strange machine rose into the air gaped che tramp gave one look and went tearing away
and up above the slraiiie car was speeding nway smaller and niitil it rfisajipeared in the distance wonld do
john looked wildly round belter try that lever li decided hopelessly
oingeriy he eased it forward the wings slid back
instantly the rai started to orop like stone
john pnlled the lever back neaier to
lie ground
tlicn most nmazing fact of all the car csiue down quite smuotbly
luck was with john be came down on a road
ami i fenia a terrific shriek from the tyres
they skidded for a second on the road eirface and tlien they imd gripped
jobu realised that the car was still in top gear and llist all the lime
he rear wheels iuuat lave been turuiug at speed
he gripped his wheel grimly
kaciug along urn road bo swung rouud a then lie gnsped night nlieail a large cor wo ihiwn op aciuss the road an accident bad lllppeucd a man lay out in lb loaitway
theiv was nobwlj in or nmr tlio cur a isr as he could soo
john nw that there w a bme hiiiicc if nvoidiiig a erasin bel ween the mid tho difi milings there was a luimm gap
he decided to nsk it
it was to uko the car aloft a second liine tlie wheel round he for lliti gap siraighl uiiongli it ho raced and then tbe was out of conlrol
jolui had one glimpse of a atrctvb uf gicen to the cliff ami dien uie sea far below lie could jo nothing but cling to the wheel
abruptly the larleapt uito space tlimo the sickening nf falling
then a terrific splash she was under
john damlvered nn to liis seat bit bis head against smnetliiiig
in some amazing fashion a loud lial clused over the lop of the car lie strove to open it
tbo shield would not budge
john blared round hint ha hiui just uial tho shield was made uf glass
he could see tho green beyond not a droji of water w entering the car
tbe ur was now absolutely watertight john head reeled
would the of this car never ueeae
8ia liad not hit the liottom
slowly be realised tliat another tlirobbing noise had started up it seemed tlul a propeller was working lbs car and was pusbing it uirougb lln water like a suhninrine
john wiped the perspiration front biz hrow a ever get out of this alive jolui told xhimseif burn tlie rotten car on earth didnot the old boy leave a note explaioiiig what sort of a freak it is
leaiiiiig forward he began to eaaniine llio mass of ou the diuhloard
one of theifi was lalielled 
asccud
his angers rlosed over it
daro he push it he must do for already the air in the car was becoming heavy
he would be siiflucated unless be could gel bark to the surface
he pushed tlie knob
it seemed to him tlial the car a little but ha cunldnot he sure
then lie noticed that the water in front of uio waa becomiug a ughter green
ho was moving back to tbe surface
a few moments later and the car was actually riding on the saa
moreover once iionnet had emerged she bounded forward ami went scudding along at speed of something like uiirty or forty miles an hour
the hood siucked bark
john pulled at his steeringwheel but it runda no impression on the cars direction
it was hurtling straight forward absolutely out of his control
tbo reason john polled so hard at tho steeriugwheel was ahead of him was a small boat
the men in it wwq pulling towards small tnunp steamer
suddenly a cry went up from um boat
it socmed that tho men bad spotted tb it most have appeared to them ti be some queer apparition
a raomeut before tlw whole expanse of sea bad been deserted
but here was a slraneolooking crafta craft that appeared to b a motorcatburtiing towards
licm at the speed of a niuiorbout
they realised that the car was heading straight in tlieir direction and tliat it almost on top of them
they jmnped to their feet ninl waved furiously
march takes a passenger wlieu wa loo lato to boav mn of tho phlh of tho cor
john dosed hie eyes udr lurched snd lie was nearly bung icoa tu sent
opening bis eyes sgsin be mw that the car bad driun ridit nito the boat catcghl ik vision of buf a men diving ioto the sea
then tlie boat hud gone
it seaiiiud that one of the men had been too late in diving ovcrlnnict
in gome queer fashion tbs bonnet of the car had pteksd him lip so lltat he was spmuling across it lie to be uncousdoos
ones iigaio john wiped iho psrspiralioa away from hi bjow
hi was hooding right out to sea
uoless ha did th ear would go hurtling on until the petrol ran out would then be at tlift mercy of the waves
suddenly he gaaprcl
what fool hed been of coorse thcne was one certain vray of stopping the car
reiching forward be gripped tlie ignition ftey and awilohed the engine off
at once the car began to slow down man on the bonnet was slirrittg nowil0 ms ovjdniilly recovering john wondeced if lie was badly hort
he ntist and turning round ho saw tbnt a brgo bad put iff fiom ibe romp it was eiigugeil hi picking ni the meu from ills capsired boat the mo lying arress tiie bonnet began to in strange
aahimi
ho rapped the wlndwraen snd appeared to lie pointing beyond john
there was an expicssion of meat horror opoi john turned in finger was hr at oore ihst the niclfirlaijnih from the stoamar was headiug teiwiuds law
sianding ill thn bnws was a man ued iu hit lioud
willi a leeling of astonishment john leaiisad it wns a rcvofni
for a moicciil he knew a sudden unreasonlag temr
suopami of tho crew of tho boat hail imui vownedf lu that case ic was a murderer
alomsl without ihinhiag he isaoed forward and tunied the awitcla two temfir hoefefires
then the car ms in metion
it gathered speed with amazing rapidity
blit sftmething had bsppenod wiito the car itad been stationary the motion of the waves had swnng her right round
as she started fnrvijird john realised iw was iuick for tlie land
the swung round in ojj tg liesd john oft
if i ran gut her ashore thnught uia meulisnir ahte to make a dash for itv sooner out of this car and away the bellur crack the man in the bows of the tauncli bad fired and the hiilirt smashed against the outside of uie glass sptiolend a little but that was all
john minkod
evidently ui windows of surprising csr wenj holletpreof one again the man is the uondi firod
nu doubt they had that the gnn would bring john to his teases and caosa him to stop
then tlie man
he ffou turned and shoutnd ue had evidently thought chat joim iateoded to nta thm clown
at the last moment the lauueii tried to swerve away
so violent was the movament tliat ong gunwliale dipped under water
thn nrew went slithering in a heap and sevund of them were jerked tho nor missed tho hiiincb hj larp fiiot
she rocked diuily in the sacll cmatod by the launch but it mndo lillls or no impression upon her speed

john was still lowring daredly at ilinotlior wlioo ibore caaie a about ftoni tho direction of the sea
both men swung round
at ton speed the uunuh was hooding for tbe bay
