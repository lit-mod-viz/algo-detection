to beyond i invisible horizons the quest i i i name i address i city state zip issues back in january to be exact this space mused on the satisfactions derived from reading about the adventures of john jakes brak the barbarian
yet a reader whose letter we quoted demurred saying brak is no barbarian
what is he
shortly thereafter author jakes arose to defend his hero and the following first and last word on the subject i swear is from creator it is considered unseemly for writers to write letters of argument about their creations
but i canot resist
there is indeed a quality about khurdisan
but i know incidentally what will happen to when the time comes soon or late for him to play out his last adventure
i know now whether he will or whether he wonot reach khurdisan
it will be unravelled the last time he ever sees print in a piece which i think will be called the battle for the world
what is brak
well he is referred to by me as the barbarian which he is by an accident of birth and upbringing
as i get to know him though i discover he has learned a great deal on his own peculiar sort of grand tour
and i would only point out that it is who has a bit of courage some simple honor who is always being addressed as barbarian or outlander by the villains
there really is no doubting that is hopelessly oldfashioned in many ways and not at home in a world of worldly affluent princes who are adepts at all sorts of human unkindness and think nothing of calling on a few monsters in order to get one up on their neighbors
i like him anyway
and there is nothing so pleasant as learning that a given reader is at least not indifferent to him

he could never erase from his memory the evil face of the child of horror the loathsome thing that waited in by dark secret had driven laurence cullum to the edge of nervous hysteria what unutterable obligation had forced him to cry out for succor like an agonized madman
these and other questions relevant to the desperate condition of the master of cullum house perplexed doctor nathan buttrick as he clucked his team homeward through penaubsket bridge on the fringe of sabbathday in northern new england
in other circumstances he might have been dozing lulled by the cries of the nighthawks aloft and the peace of an upland twilight
but now although his body craved sleep his mind was vitally awake
doctor buttrick was baffled by the peculiar malady which made each day a living horror for cullum
all the sedatives of the pharmacoepia had failed to quell the anxiety which gnawed at the mind of his patient
in his frustration at the failure of the tablets and injections the physician had even resorted to folk remedies whispered by blackgummed grandmothers in the hills back from the sea
infusions of tea and henbane petals of amaryllis held under the tongue he had tried all the highcountry nostrums which once he held in professional scorn
they were as futile in calming cullum as the most advanced drugs the age could offer
as the feeble lights of sabbathday came into view around the granite mass of gallowglass hill buttrick reviewed once again the particulars of the case
laurence cullum age afflicted with a cerebral aneurism a soft patch in a brain artery which might burst tomorrow in five years or never
he was the last of the cullum line a prominent family begun by draper cullum the leader of the expedition which struck northward from dunstable to find on an august sunday the protected harbor on the north atlantic around which would grow the seacoast town of sabbathday
the cullums had always been influential in the town yet oddly retiring
laurence was the most hermitic of the lot
since the death of his sister emma and the diagnosis of his aneurism he had shut himself up in the gray new england gothic mansion at the end of windham road
his controlling hand was still felt on many of the towns business affairs but this was merely the ghost of the man
his physical presence was sequestered behind the grotesque archway of cullum house two enormous jawbones of a sperm whale erected during the tenancy of the last patriarch captain hugh
these facts and the few pleasantries that buttrick had exchanged with cullum during the mans infrequent visits to town were all that the doctor knew of the cullum heir before treatments for the aneurism began
except for the grim scene on the night of death two years before
the physician had been in attendance accompanied by cullum and most of the household staff
buttrick would never forget the last words of emma spoken as she clutched her brothers arm in a whiteknuckled hand
laurence you will keep the guardianship i shall my dear cullum replied as a mad trapped look appeared in his eyes
then the life of the frail spinster eked out its last heartbeat and usefulness had ended doctor heard nothing of a laurence cullum for a year and a half after his sisters demise
then came the midnight telephone call
buttrick rolled groggily from his bed expecting a summons to the side of any one of three wives who were awaiting childbirth
instead he was shocked into full awareness by an almost hysterical voice begging him to administer relief
although years of medical practice had somewhat jaded his sensibility to human pain buttrick heard a voice so filled with a frantic tension that the listener himself became afraid in an unconscious resonance with the pleading tones
he whipped his team across the surly penaubsket river and along windham road guided only by the chill light of a threequarter moon
at the end of the headlong ride he found cullum in a state of extreme anxiety within the mouldering drawing room of the mansion
the earpiece of the telephone was still off its hook as the man cowered in a great wing chair whimpering like an injured child in shocking contrast to the manliness of his sixfoot frame
although he was wrapped in a dressing gown trouser cuffs bore traces of drying mud
buttrick quickly administered the standard dosage of a sedative
it had no effect
a second injection calmed cullum or rather removed the physical manifestations of his hysteria
but even as the drug subdued his trembling cullum retained a spark of horror in his eyes
repeatedly buttrick questioned the sufferer about the cause of his alarming discomposure
and each time the gauntfaced cullum had burrowed deeper into the plush of the wing chair mumbling under the sedation say mustnot say
no one must ever know
the guardianship
despite himself the physician felt a growing fear at the recurrence of that ominous term first uttered in his hearing by the dying lips of emma culum
at last the opiate calmed the mans chaotic nerves
with the aid of amadee an aged acadian manservant the doctor wrestled the drugged weight onto a settee near the fire
he left a vial of tablets with the servant and the assurance that he would visit his master on the next day
then buttrick returned to town exhausted physically but unable to quell the incessant questioning of his curiosity
what event or obsession could explain the mental disintegration of cullum
what arcane significance had that curious term muttered by laurence even in his narcotic stupor during the months of treatment which followed the first nighttime summons the doctor had learned little else about the trouble at cullum house
he had diagnosed the aneurism but was certain that his patients extreme nervousness and loss of weight were by no means related to his physical affliction
rather there was some obligation burden perhaps something in the house itself under whose presence the mind of the cullum heir was slowly crumbling
besides the strange term spoken by both emma and laurence there was one other fact which increased the peculiarity of the case
buttrick had noticed that cullum always avoided approaching a large tapestry hanging in the drawing room another remnant of the patriarchy of captain hugh
the subject and rendition were unsettling at first glance a highly realistic depiction of a witches sabbath
the naked bodies of cabalistic women were ruddy in the glow from a fire which also illumined a bleeding victim
after a few visits buttrick had inured himself to the grisly scene
but cullum would never pass within five feet of the cloth
sometimes the doctor had the uncomfortable conviction that his patient was listening to the tapestry as though hearing the whickering laughter of the coven
gradually buttrick resigned himself to the frustration of trying to quell a malady of the spirit by chemical means
a difficult task at best
with such a secretive uncooperative patient it was almost an impossibility
such were the reflections of the toilworn leech of sabbathday as he reined his team before the weathered frame bungalow from which his father had practiced before him
after stabling the horses he ate a light supper then willingly gave himself to his mattress with a sighed hope that no major illnesses or accidents would befall the populace of the village that night
his last conscious thought was not a prayer to his creator but a mindless repetition of the eldritch phrase so full of puzzlement and in tones a taint of evil the guardianship late afternoon of the following day buttrick stood beneath the whale jaw archway of cullum house marvelling at the curving bone monoliths of this striking manifestation of the familys eccentricity
it was one of the two days of the week on which cullum was treated both for his aneurism and for the frenzy attacking his nerves
amadee was waiting behind the door
he ushered the doctor into the dank coolness of the mansion
once inside the entryway the aged acadian drew close to buttrick and seized his elbow in a surprisingly strong grip a liberty he had never before taken le docteur he said hoarsely do not be surprise if the master he tell to you some strange thing today there was a smile on the seamed lips but the coldness of eyes removed all traces of amiability from his manner
it is some time now that the master he has been saying strange thing that you should not believe la maladie it is the sickness nothing more buttrick was repelled by the servants familiarity
during his visits to the house he had found amadee a strange figure given to eavesdropping impassively as cullum made pitiful attempts at conversation with his physician
for some inexplicable reason the presence of the acadian always put buttrick on his guard as though the stooped valet carried with him a hint of evil
certainly the man added to the foreboding gloom of cullum house
buttrick pried his arm out of grip and strode quickly into the drawing room
as was his habit cullum was seated as far away from the tapestry as was physically possible
he rose unsteadily as the doctor entered the room
so so good of you to come nathan he said
although his mind was on the verge of splintering into a thousand shards of madness automatically the heir preserved the vestiges of a courtesy reserved for calmer spirits
buttrick placed his bag on a richly damasked ottoman inspecting his patients appearance with a quick professional glance
he was appalled by decline since the last visit
the man was wrapped in a crimson sittingrobe that seemed made for a larger frame so grievously had his body wasted under the bearing of his mental burden
the eyes were preternatu rally bright staring from dark sockets
cullum nervously plucked at the cord of the gown with a hand which shocked buttrick by its resemblance to blanched and with yellowed nails
the doctor had seen patients harboring within them vile malignancies fall into such decay
but dissolution was the result of a mental cancer which threatened to destroy both mind and body
it was moot which soul or flesh would perish first
now the man seemed inflamed by a strange eagerness
he motioned buttrick to close his bag and cleared his throat nervously fear nathan that i have not been the best of patients
all your medications all your attentions useless
he dismissed them with a wave of his blueveined hand
nothing will relieve me
nothing can ease the weight of this hideous charge i labor under cullum stopped briefly and seemed to listen to the tapestry
recovering his train of thought he continued
unless unless i somehow ease my mind of this guardianship he spat the word out in mingled tones of fear and loathing
unless i tell the secret i shall die and the secret shall die with me
and if i tell the secret the secret shall die and i shall die with it
almost a conundrum eh buttrick
a true gnomic riddle eh my friend he physician rose to steady cullum for his speech was assuming the peculiar cadence of madness
the man rallied mumbling not yet not yet
in a moment his face took on a grave cast as he spoke in cooler more ominous tones
you must have suspected nathan that the cause of my agony was exceedingly strange
the aneurism he tapped his temple it is nothing
we cullums have suffered more unusual maladies than that
my trouble lies deeper than the fragile flesh
the heir paused reflectively then continued
i have stood it as long as i could endured under this hideous burden longer than i thought possible
i am not as strong as emma was
not so much of a cullum perhaps
she was like my father captain hugh amazingly strongwilled
the secret of our family horror i know no other name for it was safe with her while she lived
but i two years man two years of ceaseless anxiety
and the last few months have been a waking terror buttrick had been engrossed by narration
but suddenly he started
a sound a muffled moan or cry had issued from the direction of the cabalistic tapestry
cullum saw the doctors apprehensive glance
not yet my friend
later you shall know all
for now nathan hear me out
he flicked his hand at amadee who was loitering in the door of the drawingroom
that will be all amadee
go to your duties
the acadian shuffled reluctantly into the bowels of the house
when his footsteps no longer sounded off the flaking walls of the passage cullum resumed his monologue
it is now time nathan that you knew the wellkept secret of this house for i shall tell you or die in the attempt
only by sharing this intolerable weight have i any chance of keeping my sanity
his lips trembled as he fought to maintain calmness
it is nnot easy to disburden onesself of such knowledge but i must despite the warning or i shall most surely go mad
be patient nathan and let me tell it in my own way
buttrick settled uneasily into a sofa
for a moment he felt a sudden impulse to deny cullum the opportunity to tell his tale
why should he nathan buttrick participate in this secret
his precinct was the body not the diseased mind
with its austere inhabitants and wild setting between the forest wastes and the sullen north atlantic sabbathday was eerie enough without compounding it by a knowledge of the secret of cullum house
but gradually professional instincts exerted themselves
if cullum did not gain some mental relief either the torments he underwent would render him mad or his aneurism would burst under the strain
the doctor settled back and accepted a dark sherry from his patients trembling hand
nathan said cullum have you ever heard the name ligea was the second wife i believe of your father captain hugh answered buttrick
yes if she can be called a wife
immediately buttrick knew the reason for bitter statement
the doctor had been only a child when ligea came to sabbathday yet the bizarre tales the townspeople told about her were preserved in his memory
after the death of his first wife the mother of laurence and emma captain hugh cullum had consigned his children to the care of a relative
he then embarked on his last voyage as master of the steamer ogunquit to the baltic port of riga
when he returned to sabbathday almost two years later he brought with him the numerous spoils of yankee trading and a mistress for cullum house the dark ligea rotesque rumors about this woman soon sprang up amidst the villagers
perhaps some originated in the mouths of goodwives who envied her exotic charms
for ligea was oddly beautiful a tall woman with a luminous eastern complexion sinuous in her movements heavily accented in her speech most distinctive feature was her long raven hair of a black deeper than the northern forest night
whatever their origin the stories about ligea soon were the common coin of conversation around the hearths of sabbathday
it was said that she had brought the nighthawks to cullum house
before her coming these nocturnal flyers had soared only over the backlands far from town
now they roosted in the trees of the estate trembling the night air with the beat of wings
more serious some reported that ligea had been seen on walpurgis night wantoning naked through the woods at the fringe of town
one individual who had been abroad at that hour swore that a glowing cloud had passed in from the sea over sabbathday and that voices could be heard mumbling in strange tongues from within the floating mass
an ancient dame who dwelt alone near gallowglass hill averred that ligea had spent many afternoons with the few indian sachems still alive the degenerate remainder of the pequot tribe
this nearlyextinct race it was said held powers over air and sea
the more intelligent of the townsfolk dismissed these tales as fantasies
yet all knew that ligea exerted a strange hold on captain hugh
the gruff skipper was quite deferential to her in public a far cry from his callous treatment of his first wife
there were some who even noticed more than a touch of fear in his attitude toward the tall woman whom he bore on his arm
however in her public behavior the woman was impeccable haughty of mien knowledgeable in the social graces distant yet polite
during the couples visits to town she comported herself as befitted the wife of a monied landowner
only a few noted that occasionally she exchanged knowing glances with the most depraved of the towns moral outcasts
a year after her arrival in sabbathday ligea was big with child
at this time hugh cullum ceased his frequent visits to town and seemed to enter retirement at the end of windham road
the village believed that he had secluded himself in deference to his wifes condition
not a soul understood that behind the captains bluff facade lay a spirit sorely harried by some knowledge which he could impart to no other person
several days after her confinement was due to end the news reached sabbathday that both ligea and her babe had perished in childbed
the father of nathan buttrick had been in attendance
in answer to the many queries he replied that there was nothing he could have done and divulged no other details of the tragedy
nathan recalled that his father had been unusually silent for days after the event as though meditating on some incomprehensible problem
once he had told his son that if he aspired to be a physician there was something about the cullums that he should know in the future
but then the normal course of town life was resumed
the remains of ligea were cremated and transported to her native land as she had wished
the small casket of the child took its place among the cullum ancestors in the family crspt
and nathan buttrick never heard the cullum secret from the lips of his father for the man died of a heart seizure a few months later
she was a witch damn her eyes cried cullum
the heir had become noticeably less calm toward the end of narration of the few facts he knew of ligea
now a torrent of suppression emotion broke forth
and it is not dead do you hear
not dead leapt to restrain cullum who seemed ready to run from the room
at the same moment a hideous clamor issued from the direction of the tapestry a scarcely human screeching accompanied by thudding impacts as though a body were hurling itself at the wall
it heard it heard raved cullum
he swung around and faced the cloth
you cannot hold me in bondage any longer
the guardianship is at an end
at last an end
his final words choked off in a sob
cullum pitched into a faint on the settee
the vicious sounds from the tapestry grew in intensity until the cloth and the wall behind it trembled
amadee entered the room on the run his features contorted with rage
apparently he had overheard the entire scene
the weak pig he snarled he has doom us all we are dead men dead men
he vanished down the hall his footsteps giving way to the grind of a heavy door being swung on its hinges
in a few moments buttrick heard the crack of a bullwhip over the horrid ululations
a note of pain entered the screams
they tapered off into piteous whimpers until silence returned to cullum house
buttrick knelt beside the heir struggling to revive him
for a moment he feared the aneurism had burst
but the eyelids trembled and slowly the man regained his senses
ah the relief nathan cullum sighed
no longer a prisoner in my own house
no longer keeper of the vile heritage emma passed on to me
great god laurence cried buttrick what have you hidden behind that wall could not describe it he answered
walk to the tapestry
you shall see it for yourself
buttrick moved unsteadily toward the rich cloth his breathing suspended in anticipation of whatever was to occur
open the tapestry with the cord by your hand directed callum
the doctor grasped the weighted end of the cord
he closed his eyes for a moment opened them then tugged at the cord
the tapestry slid back smoothly across the wall
beneath it the wall was discolored but blank except for a small glassed orifice at eye level
buttrick hesitated
he glanced at laurence who feebly motioned to him from the settee then fixed his eye to the peephole
a low moan escaped the physicians lips as his hand came up to clutch his throat
the orifice gave a view through the thick wall into a smaller chamber behind the drawing room
immediately opposite was a heavy steel door with a similar peephole and a sturdy grating at the bottom through which a man might crawl were it open
gnawed bones and a basin of water lay before the grill which was apparently an opening for inserting food into the chamber
a grayish light emanated from tiny clerestory windows along two sides beneath the ceiling
knots of threadlike filaments black brown and yellow littered the floor
crouched in the far corner was the tenant of this chamber a spectre so inhuman that vision momentarily blurred from the shock
it hulked panting on its hands a living human torso if such a distortion of mans form can be designated thusly
raven hair fell in hanks and tangles from a misshapen skull
bright feverish eyes glared out from beneath the shaggy brows
from the face projected only a rudimentary nose its nostrils dilating as an animal would breathe
the lips were tensed in a snarl revealing discolored teeth more like the fangs of a carnivore he thing was naked save for a ragged breechclout tied about its middle
the torso showed superhuman muscular development arms as thick as fenceposts a barrel chest partly covered by a pelt
the lower extremities were piteously withered dragging behind the upper body
yet that monstrous form carried itself to and fro in the chamber with remarkable agility supporting its weight on the arms and talonlike hands
as it lunged from one corner to the other the creature sounded an ominous murmur from deep within its dark breast
oh my dear god whispered buttrick unbelieving before the grisly sight
he had seen men mangled by awful accidents in the logging camps and even the pitiable distortions of infant bodies in stillbirths
but never had the physicians entire consciousness writhed before such a gross malformation of the human body
he slumped weakly against the wall beside the peephole
what is it laurence he asked
where where did it come from
now you realize the desperate burden i have carried these months nathan replied cullum
that thing has been in our charge since the death of my fathers second wife
it is hellchild as he watched reaction to the spectacle behind the tapestry a transformation overcame cullum
he seemed more in control of himself as though the sharing of the secret with another not in the blood line had relieved a great pressure within his spirit
seeing revulsion cullum had the presence of mind to fill another glass from the squat ships decanter and offer the stimulant to the doctor who had moved slowly away from the wall like a sleepwalker
sit down nathan and calm yourself ordered the heir sure you must have many questions about our bad seed
when buttrick had composed himself cullum spoke volubly about the origin of the chamberdweller
the doctor listened as his host told him of dying threat to the house of cullum
unless they maintained her infant in secrecy until its maturity they would perish
the guardianship as she called it must be passed from member to member
only death could release a guardian who was responsible for the care and nourishment of the creature
they would know ligea said when the child no longer needed their protection
captain hugh cullum had always scoffed at superstitions and curses
but suddenly the occult had come under his own eaves in the presence of that incredible child surrounded by a brooding evil even then in its infancy
he knew that he had not fathered such a monster
gradually the conviction grew within his mind that ligea had consorted with a spirit of darkness and that the babe was the token of their devilish love
captain hugh would allow the child no baptism
it was placed in the strongroom behind the main parlor a chamber which the guardians came to call sardonically the crib
from that time forward the tenant of that dark room behind the tapestry was known as the hellchild
and so nathan if words were true then you are listening to a dead man
the guardian who betrays the secret must die you know
superstitious nonsense cried buttrick who had recovered from his initial shock
why look at you man more relaxed than seen you in months
now laurence i canot yet explain that thing in theie or why its survived so long despite its grave malformation
but it must have a natural explanation
i admit that at first i was shocked a hideous thing
yet i can see nothing that you should fear in it
perhaps we can arrange for an institution to take over its care relieving you of the burden
as to its being a hellchild really laurence expect this type of thinking more of an upland farmer than the cullum heir
that is because you do not fully understand the terrible threat of the creature cried cullum
it must be destroyed nathan before it can commit more of its evil just begun i tell you uttrick put out his hand to steady cullum who was becoming agitated again
what evil what are you talking about laurence
do you remember that first night i called you how frantic i was the doctor nodded
and do you remember rupel oldham
buttrick involuntarily winced
oldham had been found lying in a foot of stagnant water near a fireroad through mohegan swamp
buttrick had signed the deathcertificate of the aged muskrat trapper
the body had been badly mutilated and a look of utter horror was indelibly stamped on the face
you donot mean that asked buttrick pointing toward the wall
cullum nodded
it broke out he said helplessly
we had underestimated its strength and it burst through the wooden door which the steel door you saw later replaced
amadee and i followed it as quickly as we could
it was dark
the spring rains had muddied the ground voice became dreamy as he relived the gruesome event
at first amadee and i didnot know where to look
we stood in the drive he with the bullwhip and myself carrying the lantern
it could have gone off in any direction
but then then we heard the nighthawks crying over mohegan swamp in the valley behind the estate
a terrible fierce sound laurence
they were swarming and diving as though mad
we ran through the forest on the fireroad
the sound of the birds got louder more shrill until we could see against the gray sky the place over which they were swarming
i remember wishing that i had had the presence of mind to bring a pistol
but then the light from the lantern showed us its form ahead
oh nathan oldham had come down to check his traps and it caught him there in the mud and scummy water
when we ran up it was feeding amadee lashed it with the whip and it drew back
i saw that we could do nothing for oldham
the expression on his face terrible
between the two of us we drove the creature back to the house and into the crib
it was more docile then feared the bite of the whip more than now
cullum paused and wet his lips with the sherry
but the atrocity so unsettled me that i had to call you for relief or i would have lost my mind
we should have recognized this murderous act as an unmistakeable sign that it was approaching its maturity nathan
but we thought the killing of oldham was an accident a chance encounter
no more than a month later arnold my groundskeeper passed away
he was the last of the servants save amadee
at night the beast broke out again
i was awakened by the nighthawks massing over the house
the coffin lay within the parlor
that thing had overturned it and was tearing slashing cullum clenched his fists in agony
do you understand what been living with nathan
do you wonder that my nerves are gone stirred uncomfortably
he was being drawn into the macabre web of narration
the doctor began to feel unsafe sitting only a few yards away from the tapestry
how many times had he entered the decaying drawingroom to treat the master of cullum house oblivious to the existence of a horror separated from him by only a few inches of plaster and lath
we then knew continued cullum that its ghastly appetite had been whetted
we realized that these events were not mere chance
the evil thing mothered by my fathers second wife i cannot call her my stepmother had reached its maturity
for a week after we interred arnold it screamed
i shall hear its cries until my ears are stopped by death
ravenous ferocious howls which sounded even beyond the walls of the house
amadee and his bullwhip could not control it
i stuffed my ears with cotton took laudanum drank myself into unconsciousness everything failed
that hideous keening could not be suppressed
it was then at the end of my wits that i made the decision for which if ever a man were damned i shall be
i had to stop the screaming nathan do you understand that
buttrick shook his head slowly scarce daring to consider what awful revelation he would hear next ordered amadee ah even now i cannot bring myself to pronounce the words
cullum fought visibly to control his rising emotion
he sprang from the settee and paced the room
amadee in addition to being my only servant is also he blurted the words out
custodian of the sabbathday burial ground
do you understand my meaning
then the bones in the chamber and those fibers hanks of hair
buttrick asked incredulously
how many evenings have i slumped in that very chair listening to that beast at its unholy supper how often have i considered suicide anything to free me of this vile guardianship
even amadee has become infected by it i truly believe he enjoys tending the creature and disciplining it with his bullwhip
he derives a sense of power from those duties
the old man thinks me weak and scorns me because my nerves cannot stand the strain
but what a burden god help me i am the protector of a a long silence followed the impassioned confession
the room had become oppressively thickatmosphered
buttrick opened the french doors which led to a terrace and thence the drive
the sky was yet aglow and only the drone of frogs at mohegan swamp heralded the approach of night
the birds roosting in the trees about the house had not yet begun their darkling flights
the doctor turned and addressed cullum
is there any danger that it will break out again laurence
the steel door has thus far resisted its attempts he replied
occasionally it hurls it self at the door for an hour at a time
its ferocity is appalling
but the door and its frame remain fast
the heir sighed deeply
yet a mere steel door cannot be sufficient to hold such a malignant evil
it must be destroyed nathan and quickly
i can no longer protect the town from its appetite
and now that i have discovered the cullum secret to you i feel that if we do not act soon the thing will be at large with no one to stop it
for it heard me betray it i am sure and craves my death
buttrick was convinced
now his mind no longer operated in accord with the civilized virtues of reason and mercy
his own experience that day at cullum house and his hosts desperate words had brought to life within him the savages fear of the unknown
he agreed to assist in the extermination of the cieature and swore that no word of the proceedings would ever pass his lips
since cullum assured him that he could spend another night in the house with the hellchild buttrick decided to return to sabbathday
on the morrow he would return to the estate to plan the destruction and interment of the beast for they would need daylight to dig its unholy resting place
on the portico of the mansion beneath the arched jawbones cullum seized hand in a firm grip only wish my father had taken this course in the beginning he said
then perhaps he emma and myself would have been spared the blight which has sapped our lives
he ran his hand along the cool ivory of the curving white monoliths know that wherever he is my father approves the action we must take
buttrick nodded in silent agreement
he bade the heir a good night and turned his team onto the darkness of windham road
as he left the grounds of the estate the nighthawks were beginning their evening clamor
their rasping cries banished the peace of the autumn evening
a fter his return to the bungalow the doctor lay sleepless distracted by vivid mental phantasms of what he had heard and witnessed that evening
each time he closed his eyes the scene in the crib flashed across the screen of his conscious mind in all its loathsome detail
he could not erase from his memory the glowering countenance of the hellchild a face so evil it seemed impossible that flesh and bone could be tortured into receiving the stamp of such malignancy
buttrick could well understand why captain hugh had disclaimed parentage of the child
and now buttrick himself had been drawn into the cullum horror
he had sworn to aid in the destruction of a thing which might still bear within it a spark of humanity despite heated denials and the mystery of its parentage
vicious instinctively homicidal yes but was this enough he asked himself enough cause to betray a greater oath that one which bound nathan buttrick to use his skills only for the preservation of life it was a quandary and the man writhed under the weight of his contradictory obligations
the doctor had thus lain staring at the slowly rising patch of moonlight on his wall for three hours when the telephone beside his bed rang
with a sudden clairvoyance buttrick knew that this was no ordinary call summoning him to the sickbed of a villager
he swung out of the bed and snatched the earpiece from the hook
the voice of laurence cullum dinned in his ear
nathan come quickly man
we canot hold it breaking out of the crib over voice came the sound of splintering wood and a ravening ululation such as never sprang from human throat
the telephone crashed to the floor as buttrick leapt to struggle into his clothes
he vaulted across the yard to the barn scarce feeling the bite of the early hoarfrost
with frantic speed he harnessed the team and urged them out of their warm quarters into the chill darkness of the road where the moon hardly penetrated the roof of overhanging trees
five minutes after the call the wildeyed horses lunged through the shadows of penaubsket bridge onto the gravel of windham road
although the doctor was a good master to his animals now he whipped them cruelly
he called the two mares by name hurling imprecations foreign to his lips in an effort to gain more speed
black masses of maple and oak lashed by their sharp twigends striking blood from face when the surrey veered too close to the roads edge
twice it seemed that all horses surrey and driver must surely fall to perdition so headlong was their flight in rounding curves where granite outcroppings changed the roads direction
if a goodman of the town had been abroad at that hour he would have crossed himself in utter terror at the approach of the flying team and whipman
it seemed an age to buttrick but at last the lights of cullum house glimmered through the thickets ahead
at the stone pillars which marked the entrance to the estate the horses shied nearly throwing the doctor from his seat
the whip cracked once twice but they would not enter
the team stood ready to bolt in the face of a terror which their senses could detect even at that far remove
buttrick leapt down from the surrey and made for the house afoot
the rains of early autumn had washed innumerable gullies into the clay of the drive
several times he stumbled almost twisting an ankle beneath him
over the sound of his labored breathing came a confusion of highpitched cries
the nighthawks were swarming above the house in a dense cloud
their mass eclipsed the light of the moon as they climbed to an apogee plummeted suicidally toward the ground then arced upwards
all about him the doctor heard the beat of their wings
nearing the great house buttrick saw that the french doors which he had opened in another world it seemed were still ajar
the parlor within was lighted
sobbing from his exertions he lurched onto the terrace and leaned against the door frame
laurence he cried
laurence where are you the doctors gaze slowly swept the room
the ottoman on which he had set his bag that afternoon lay on its side the stufling exposed through a long rent in the fabric
on the far wall the tapestry hung in folds from one of its corners
beneath the discolored area of the wall framed a gaping hole partially obstructed with shards of plaster and fanglike laths
by main force the captive behind that wall had clawed and butted its way out of the crib
buttrick stepped into the room aghast at the wreckage of the oncesumptuous chamber
from behind an overturned sofa a moan broke the stillness more like a sigh than an expression of pain
cullum lay crumpled against the wall hurled there by the inhuman force of the thing as it rushed from its confinement
laurence
are you all right man cried the physician
there was a deep gash on brow
see see to amadee
in the hall
i afraid it caught him nathan
buttrick found the acadian halfway down the hallway which lead to the steel door of the crib
the hellchild had seized him at his middle and dashed him fatally against the floor
beside the dead servant lay the bullwhip a puny weapon against a force of such unutterable malevolence
the doctor returned quickly to attend cullum
the shock of the events could prove dangerous to the aneurism
the weak spot of the brain artery might rupture from the slightest stress
but the heir indicated dazedly that he was unharmed except for the head wound
it went outside whispered cullum could hear it scrabbling about on the portico before you came
thank god its stopped screaming
i could not bear that sound another minute
are there any firearms in the house asked buttrick
only an ancient pistol which failed me
cullum pointed to an old handgun lying at the middle of the floor tried to fire at it as it came through the wall but the mechanism was rusty from age
the beast flicked me off like a doll and went for amadee perhaps because he took so much pleasure in whipping it
but it will return to finish me nathan because it has now matured and needs its guardian no longer
cullum smiled weakly as a wistful expression fixed itself upon his pallid face
if death is the price of freedom from that child of the pit then i shall pay it gladly he said uttrick suddenly stiffened
somewhere beyond the open doors of the entryway he heard the sound of deep animal respirations
a growl loosed itself from a savage throat must close and bar those doors the doctor muttered to himself for cullum had lapsed into an almost trancelike state
he grasped a heavy poker and walked carefully through the hall
if it comes at me he thought must slash at the eyes
the eyes
the main doors of the house stood thrown open to the night
although it now rode the treetops the moon illumined the steps up which buttrick would have raced had he not entered through the french doors
the cries of the ominous birds had ceased
they roosted in the elms and oaks as though awaiting a climactic event
the doctor peered out onto the lawn keeping well within the shadows of the entryway
nothing stirred
he stepped into the doorframe and quickly scanned right and left
again there was only the wash of moonlight on the lawn and longdeserted walks
no sound was audible except an occasional chirrup from the trees
buttrick exhaled slowly
it seemed that the thing had run off perhaps to mohegan swamp where it had claimed its first victim
this was work for a search party in the morning not for a middleaged physician unarmed except for a poker
wiping his brow against his sleeve buttrick stepped onto the portico beneath the massive jawbones
the moon caught the whiteness of the eccentric archway
he ran his palm along the ivory smoothness grateful for a touch of cool solidity
standing there for a moment the man seemed to gain strength from the contact of his hand with the curving pillars of bone
on the steps of the mansion he took a final surveying glance over the grounds unwilling to stray farther from the light
all was quiet
we will run the beast to earth in the bogs come sunup he thought
surely it cannot escape us there
suddenly the trees at the edge of the estate swayed at their tops as the nighthawks again winged aloft
the doctors calmness left him
he started up the steps to regain the relative security of the house
but as he mounted the last step his eyes caught a dark mass hulking at the very top of the arch where the whalebones intersected
at the same moment a guttural cry which seemed to tremble the entire portico pealed down at him head snapped up
on the peak of the arch balanced on its clawlike hands crouched the hellchild
its long snarled hair cascaded down over the joint where the tops of the bones were clamped together
the fantastically developed shoulder and arm muscles knotted as the creature prepared to hurl itself downward upon buttrick
in the splitsecond it took his arm to bring the poker up he realized that the thing had expected him to enter through the main door when he arrived in answer to call for help
it had climbed to the top of the arch hidden there by the shadow of the eaves in order to fall upon him as he entered the house
then all thought ceased for nathan buttrick as he saw the macabre figure let go the top of the arch and launch itself at him with a bellow he poker flashed sideways in a vicious arc aimed at the point in space where the eyes should have been at that moment
but it smote the empty air
for as buttrick began his stroke the long raven hair of the beast caught in the ironwork which braced the top of hugh arch
the momentum of its lunge carried the hellchild clear of the ivory columns
it plummeted downward for the merest frac24 tion of a heartbeat then a terrible jerk ceased its plunge
it swung between the columns like a grotesque marionette hanging by its own matted hair
the doctor could not breathe as he gaped at the frantic contortions of the creature
the cruel arms flailed and beat the air as it struggled to haul itself back to the top of the arch
from that brutish throat came a scream of incredible fury
the face grimaced from pain and rage
flecks of foam spotted the snarling lips
for a moment it seemed that the hair surely must part unable to support such a weight
but then a report like a muffled gunshot stilled the writhing of that hideous form
its neck broken the hellchild hung limply above the steps of the house it had terrorized through the long decades
unstrung by the terrible selfexecution he had witnessed
buttrick fell to his knees on the floor of the portico
for minutes he sagged there his fingers still gripping the haft of the useless poker
the trembling which shook his entire frame gradually subsided
suddenly remembering the wounded heir who lay inside he roused himself and entered the house
cullum was sitting as before propped against the wall
his face was ashen but his eyes glimmered with surprise as buttrick knelt beside him
you you are alive nathan he whispered
does the beast still live
the doctor quickly related the grisly death of the hellchild
it was apparent to him that his friend was falling into a decline from which he would never recover
the aneurism had been fatally disturbed by the nights events
then i am afree cried cullum
at long last free of that terrible presence
ah liberty
blessed blessed liberty the voice of the heir trailed off in a final sob
buttrick gently placed a pillow beneath the still head and closed the eyes
the master of cullum house the last guardian of the hellchild was dead a long time the physician stood in the shambles of the parlor trying to fathom some meaning in what he had experienced
two corpses lay in that silent mansion
beneath the whalejaw archway hung the carcass of the familys child of darkness claimed by this architectural whim of its first guardian
the grim sequence of events was too unsettling to comprehend
but now it was time for action
impelled by some allegiance which endured even the death of the last cullum the doctor resolved never to divulge the horror in which he had participated
crawling into the crib through the broken wall he cleaned the chamber of all traces of the occupancy
on the portico he cut down the monstrous body and loaded it onto the surrey
buttrick inched the surrey down the dark fire road to mohegan swamp
in a desolate reach of the bog he interred the remains of the vicious life which had brought cullum house to ruin
only then did he call the sabbathday constable
the account which that officer received was deliberately intended to excite no undue curiosity
as buttrick told it he had received a nighttime call from the heir requesting medication for his condition
near the end of their conversation the line abruptly went dead
upon his arrival at the house he found that apparently a burglar of considerable strength had slain amadee
cullum had been struck once as the single gash on his brow testified
the blow had fatally aggravated his aneurism
foiled by the steel door of the strongroom behind the parlor the thief and murderer had broken through the wall into the chamber
but he found no treasure for the room had not been used for years
no person in sabbathday not even the investigating constable questioned the veracity of the doctors explanation
nathan buttrick hid within himself the memory of that ghastly night at cullum house until death eased him of the woeful burden
now residents of the village rarely speak of the cullum tragedy
since there were no heirs the great house reverted to windham county and was razed for its timbers
in the town cemetery the cullum family crypt is sealed forever and the sabbathday burial ground is a place of peace embraced on all sides by the northern forest
but in mohegan swamp the nighthawks disturb the twilight calm
they have inhabited the lowlands since the pulling down of cullum house
at sundown while the main flock wheels and cries over the brackish water a few nightfliers roost atop a curious mound near the shoulder of a fireroad through the swamp
each year the mound grows somewhat higher
the forest warden who first noticed the growth believed it to be merely a subterranean tangle of living willow roots sent out by the trees which overhang the bog
yet the birds who frequent the hillock utter strange fervid cries as if urging on the evolution of something within the peculiar pile
it is unlikely that the mound will stir the curiosity of the townsfolk
whatever phenomenon is at work will reach completion undisturbed the end by long legs short legs voice tapes throat voice tapes childish prob lems problems always problems even in the wellrun world of moderan
i was on a july monday that little sister was under his window very early with a big box in her arms
the vapor cover that day was pink as indeed it would be for all of july as set by the central vapor shield control and the vapor light saving people
the temperature was controlled to a pleasant degrees inside and outside and he as usual was working on a formula
my little playmate came she shouted my little sister
come see
he plasticlegged and ironx replaced arose from his hipsnuggie chair and went to the edge of his door the nonsense he asked metalfogged and weary
why arenot you napping
or behaving with mox
mox was her iron man who looked after her needs like a mother in the red plastic hut where she lived apart from other folk while awaiting the age of replacements my little companion little sister shrieked sent for her
she came today in the mail
he rubbed his eyes with the backs of his goldseal hands
he tried to think across the metal fields
a man of advanced times he had submitted to many ironx and a few goldseal replacements since coming up from olderun in a move toward durability in a move to conquer imnaortality for the corporeal self
but sometimes this metal self that was fast becoming his main self dominated the flesh strips to such an extent that he found it difficult to force thoughts to track the petty paths of everyday
across the pathless fields of the high dimensions he was a keen hot hound on the scent of formulae
with what was left of his family little sister he sometimes found it hard going even to converse on plain terms
tell me slowly he pleaded
she took a deep breath
her good full chest swelled in a triumph of flesh and bone
her brown eyes were sparklebright when she said mustnot grow up alone even if i am the last little girl
as i await the age of replacement i must have a companion which same just came in the mail
daddy
and you will put her together
daddy so we can play
i have named her already little slots
slots was a box full of slotted metal a few wires some power wafers many tapes a head various curved pieces of white plastic certain parts that were almost flesh and the printed sheet of directions
slots was a pile of junk and a headache confronting a man dedicated to solitude eternity and calm companionless thinking on universal deep problems
slots as she was unassembled had cost five hundred thousand dollars cash by gift certificate from the organization for the entertainment of little flesh people
there was a clatter in his joints of metal scraping on metal and the wincing of the fiesh strips as he knelt to one knee there on the gray bare yard and took up the box that contained slots
he opened the box and saw a waxwarm face smirking up at him an enigmatic face that could have been a nine year old girls face or a much older girls face made of plastic and wreathed in real hair
the mechanical mouth tumbled open and beautifully formed white teeth gleamed out of the rubbery lips bite your big feet off if you arenot good to me the beautiful fliilatious head threatened right away mechanically and pleasantly enough
then a clamor started up change the tape change the tape jumped like a bucket full of the sun had just come highboiling down through all those miles through all the pink vapor shield to spill on a jot of his flesh
when he jumped pieces of slots and the box in which she had been mailed scattered fanwise across the gray yard
but the head sitting smiling in the middle of the scattered pieces had a tape for the situation
butterfingery old cold widower and a halfwit moron girl it said
then it spent about five minutes bouncing up and down on the plastic yard sheet and screaming shame shame foul foul save me save me
after that the head very businesslike rolled about picking up its parts and slotting everything together until a pleasingly tall and slim fair girl of metal and white plastic stood smiling in the cool rose glow ef the pink vapor shield of july
well and wheres the bogs she said as she deftly stooped to tear out the white nylowov lining of the box in which she had been mailed
she wrapped the long piece of snowy cloth about her in such a way that it was tastefully full and loose in places and taut across other places to enhance her fine plastic curves
always pays to please the bogs she said
the bogs said little sister bewildered and still somewhat dazed by the performance she had just seen
what do you mean bogs
the oggosite rex
like the meg for the wogen
damn faulty tape she said making a sour face
then she said with a throaty voice and a new clear tape mean where are the boys
the opposite sex
like the men for the women a girl she smiled to be my little playmate until ready for replacements said little sister simply and with a heart full of love for the warm metal and plastic thing towering over her got ever so many cardwov cutout dollies
you can have one
and two changes of clothes for her
today
little face shone beatific from the beautiful gesture and the openhearted strain of such hard giving
and let you color a little with my ray spray if youll promise cross your heart not to bust it
slots was coldly eyeing little sister distaste and boredom and pitying amusement in every stare
aw go grow up she said gritty voiced with the tape for the occasion here to play with your dad
i think
little sister was near to tears
but father eager as ever he thought to get the silly diversions over with get little sister back to her place and himself in his hipsnuggie chair for more formula thinking had been scientifically and purposefully reading the directions after he had recovered from the initial shock of hearing slots talk and seeing her put herself together
he remembered that the first of these dolls was at least ten years old now and the idea for them was much much older and all this helped him regain his confidence in the allrightness of things
when he came to the part of the instructions he just slipped over quickly caught slots firmly by an arm took the long sections out of her legs and proceeded to secure her rangechange to the place calibrated we ship them from our factory on the directions stated the calibration of widest versatility and greatest demand
but they function quite as well on if wired to it securely after first being relieved of the long sections of the legs
and slots down to little sister size now was busily rewinding her dress to make up for her new status in stature
then she said a little dully it seemed with the tape for the occasion go play cutouts
and really love to use your rayspray coloring thing if i may little sister and little slots went off across the gray plastic yard toward little red hut and father with the long sections of legs tucked firmly under one arm hastened fast as he could back to his hipsnuggie chair and his big desk for thinking
but just as he feared might be the case he found that he was not now thinking clean on universal deep problems he had this other problem now that would have to be solved before he could get his heart out of the bumps and jumps and back to universal coolgear smoothness
oh why did these things have to happen
why couldnot little sister have just behaved with mox her iron man instead of ordering this silly doll playmate
but father like the dogged fighter he had always been did not dodge the issue he got right to grips with the problem even if his heart was not yet quite as smooth and reliable as it should have been
then too he had to work with a mind that was really not much good now at pertinent fleshtype questions but he would decide
should he order a doll of his own or just change the legs back and forth on this one when little sister was sleeping

pick up a copy todayl by part two of three parts synopsis of part one brion bayard a former american diplomat now a colonel in the intelligence service of the imperium the supranational government which rules the net of alternate worlds opened up by the development in of the maxonicocini generator is summoned late one evening to the office of his old friend baron von richthofen chief of imperial intelligence
as armed guards stand by richthofen quizzed bayard closely on matters of personal life and recent activities which are well known to both parties
satisfied richthofen dismisses the guards apologizes but offers no explanation
as bayard leaves the building he sees charred footprints in the corridor follows them to an unused subcellar and there encounters a fantastic glowing figure bending over a fallen man
bayard attacks long pink sparks jump from the fiery figure to meet him and a titanic explosion slams him into unconsciousness
he awakens to find himself alone the city deserted except for a lone column of marching creatures nonhuman apelike figures in coveralls and helmets
he trails them to the net garages where the alternateworldtravelling shuttles are housed discovered he commandeers an alien shuttle parked among the imperial machines and finds himself locked on an automatic course for the aliens home world
arriving in the hagroon world he is hauled from the machine beaten marched through streets thronged with apemen of a dozen varieties toiling in harness beside mastodgns
he is thrust into a cell where he finds dzok a representative of still another nonhuman race of anthropos
dzok he learns is an agent of the authority a supergovernment which like the imperium rules a vast empire of alternate worlds
only the vastness of the net or the web as dzok calls the continuum of parallel universes has prevented the two powers from meeting in the past
they escape together and in a stolen shuttle travel to home world xonijeel where dzok says bayard will doubtless receive help in returning to the world of the imperium and in solving the mystery of the deserted capital
he is given a hearing before a couvr cil of elders but instead of help he is condemned to transportation for life to a subtechnical the play of light on the set of gauzy curtains at the open window for a long time before i began to think about who owned them
the recollection came hard like a lesson learned but not used for a while
i had had a breakdown a nervous collapse that was it while on a delicate mission to louisiana the details were vague and now i was resting at a nursing home in harrow run by kindly mrs rogers
i sat up felt a dizziness that reminded me of the last time i had spend a week flat on my back after a difficult surveillance job in in
i had a momentary halfrecollection of a strange city and many faces and
it was gone
i shook my head lay back
i was here for a rest a nice long rest then with my pension a sudden clear picture of my passbook showing a balance of gold napoleons on deposit at the banque credit londres flashed across my mind i could settle somewhere and take up gardening the way always wanted to
the picture seemed to lack something but it seemed too much trouble to think about it now
i looked around the room it was small cheery with sunlight and brightpainted furniture with hooked rugs on the floor and a bedspread decorated with a hunting scene that suggested long winter nights tatting by an open are
the door was narrow paneled brownpainted wood with a bright brass knob
the knob turned and a buxom woman with grey hair cheeks like apples a funny little hat made of lace and a many32 colored skirt that brushed the floor came in gave a jump when she saw me and beamed as though just said she made apple pie like mr bayard awake
she had a squeaky voice as jolly as the whistle on a peanut stand with an accent i couldnot quite place
and hungry too guessing like a lovely bowl of soup now wouldnot ye sir and maybe a dab of pudding after nice steak smothered in mushrooms sounds better i said and uh i had meant to ask her who she was but then i remembered kindly mrs rogers of course glass of wine if its available i finished and lay back watching little bright spots dance before me
of course and a nice hot bath first be lovely mr bayard just call hilda things were a little hazy then for a few minutes i was vaguely aware of bustlings and the twitter of feminine voices
hands plucked at me tugged gently at my arms
i made an effort got my eyes open saw the curve of a colored apron over a girlish hip
she was leaning across me just getting my pajama jacket off
beyond her the older woman was directing two husky blonde males in maneuvering something heavy below my line of sight
the girl straightened and i caught a glimpse of a slim waist a nicely rounded bosom and arm a saucy face under straightcut hair the color of clover honey
the two men finished and left the motherly type with them
the girl fussed for a minute then followed the others leaving the door open
i got up on one elbow saw a enamelled bathtub half full of water placed neatly on the oval rug a big fluffy towel a scrub brush and a square cake of white soap on a small stool beside it
it looked inviting
i sat up got my legs over the side of the bed took deep breaths until the dizziness went away then pulled off the purple silk pajama bottoms and stood shakily
oh ye shouldnot try to walk yet sir a warm contralto voice said from the doorway
honeyhair was back coming toward me with a concerned look on her pert features
i made a halfhearted grab for my pants almost fell sat down heavily on the bed
she was beside me now with a strong hand under my arm
gunvor and been worried about ye sir
the doctor said yed been very sick but when ye slept all day yesterday i wasnot following what she said one thing to wake up in an unfamiliar room and have a little trouble getting oriented its considerably different to realize that youre among total strangers and that you have no recollection at all of how you got there her assistance i made the three steps to the tub hesitated before tackling the climb in
just put your foot in thats right the girl was saying
i followed orders stepped in and sat down feeling too weak even to wince at the hot water
the girl perched on the stool beside me tossed her head to get her hair back reached for my arm
hilda she said live just along the road
it was exciting when gunvor phoned and told me about yer coming sir
it isnot often we see a louisianan here and a diplomat too
ye must lead the most exciting life i suppose yeve been in egypt and austria and spain and even in the seminole nation
she chattered and sudsed me as unconcernedly as a grandmother bathing a five year old
what little impulse to resist i may have had faded fast i was as weak as a fiveyear old and it felt good to have this lively creature briskly massaging my back with the brush while the sun shone through the window and the breeze flapped the curtain yere accident sir
i realized hilda had asked a ques34 tion an awkward one
i had a powerful reluctance to admit that i had or appeared to have some sort of mild amnesia
i hadnot forgotten everything of course
it was just that the details were hazy
hilda the man that brought me here did he tell you anything about me about the accident the letter
hilda jumped up went across to a table decorated with red yellow blue and orange painted flowers brought back a stiff square envelope
the doctor left this for ye sir
i almost forgot i reached for it with a wet hand got the flap open pulled out a single sheet of paper on a fancy letterhead formally typed mr bayard it is with deep regret and expressions of the highest personal regard that i confirm herewith your retirement for disability from the diplomatic service of his imperial majesty napoleon fifth
there was more all about my faithful service and devotion to duty regrets that i hadnot recovered in time for a personal sendoff and lots of hopes for a speedy convalescence
the name of a lawyer in paris was included who would answer all my questions and if at any time he could be of assistance etc etc
the name at the end was familiar but then of course everybody knew count regis de manfure deputy foreign minister for security good old reggie
i read the letter twice then folded it and crammed it back into the envelope
my hands were quivering
who gave you this my voice came out hoarse the doctor sir
they brought ye in the carriage two nights since and he was most particular about ye
a pity about yere friends having to hurry to catch the steampacket for calais what did he look like the doctor
hilda resumed her scrubbing
he was a tall gentleman sir handsomely dressed and with a lovely voice
dark he was too
but i saw him only for a moment or two and in the gloom of the stableyard i couldnot make out more she giggled
but i did mark his eyes were close together as two hazelnuts in an eggcup
was he alone
there was the coachmen sir and i think another gentlemen riding inside but did mrs rogers gunvor see them
only for a few moment sir
they were in a shocking hurry
hilda finished with the bath dried me helped me into clean pajamas helped me stagger back to bed and tucked me in
i wanted to ask questions but sleep came down over me like a flood from a broken dam he next time i woke up i felt a little more normal
i got out of bed tottered to the closet found a suit of strangelooking clothes with narrow trousers and wide lapels a shirt with ruffles at collar and wrist shoes with tiny buckles
but of course they werenot really strange i corrected myself
very stylish in fact and new with the tailors tag still in the breast pocket
i closed the closet went to the window for a look
it was still open and late afternoon sun glowing in the potted geraniums on the sill
below was a tidy garden a brick walk a white picket fence and in the distance a tallopenwork church spire
there was an odor of freshcut hay in the air
as i watched hilda came around the corner with a basket in her hand and a shawl over her head
she had on a heavy anklelength skirt and wooden shoes painted in red
she saw me and smiled up at me
hello there sir have you had yer sleep out now
she came over lifted the basket to show me a heap of deep red tomatoes they lovely sir slice ye some for dinner
they look good hilda i said
how long have i been asleep
this last time sir altogether
well ye came about midnight after we tucked ye in ye slept all through the next day and night and woke this morning about ten
after yer bath ye went back and slept till now what time is it
about five so thats another six hours and more
she laughed slept like one drugged sir i felt a weight slide off me like thawed snow off a steep roof
drugged
i wasnot sick i was doped to the eyebrows got to talk to gunvor i said
where is she
in the kitchen plucking a fine goose for yer dinner sir
shall i tell her no getting dressed find her
sir are ye sure yere feeling well enough fine
i turned back to the closet fighting the drowsiness that washed around me like thick fog got out the clothes donned underwear a loosesleeved silk shirt and tight black pants of heavy cavalry twill eased my feet into the slippers
out in the narrow notquitestraight passage papered in woodland scenes and decorated with framed tintypes i followed the sounds of clattering crockery pushed through a swinging door into a lowceilinged tilefloored room with a big black coal range stainless steel sinks where a teenage girl soaped dishes before a window with a flowerbox just outside a glasspaneled door a display of copper pots on the wall and a big scrubbedlooking wooden table where gunvor stood working over the goose
why its mr bayard she blew a feather off her nose looking flustered
i leaned on the table for support trying not to think about the buzzing in my head
gunvor did the doctor give you any medicine for me
he did indeed sir the little drops for yer soup and the white powders for yer other dishes though since yeve taken no solid food as yet no more medicine gunvor
everything was blacking out around me i planted my feet tried to will away the dizziness
mr bayard yere not strong enough yet ye shouldnot be on yere feet
not going back to bed
need to walk i got out
get me outside i felt arm under mine heard her excited voice i was vaguely aware of stumbling up steps then the coolness of outofdoors
i tried again drew a couple of deep breaths blinked away the fog
better i said
just walk me
gunvor kept a running string of clucks and suggestions that i lie down right away i ignored her kept walking
it was a nice garden with bricked walks curving and meandering among the vegetable plots past a rose bed along the side under fruit trees at the far end by a tempting bench under a thickboled oak and back to the kitchen door go around again i tried not to lean on gunvor this time i was feeling rapidly stronger i could feel faint stirrings of appetite
the sun was sinking fast throwing long cool evening shadows across the grass
after the third lap i waited by the kitchen door while gunvor fetched a pitcher from the brown wooden ice box and poured me a glass of cool cider
now yell sit and wait for yer dinner mr bayard gunvor suggested anxiously all right now i patted the hand she had laid on my arm watched me anxiously as i started off
i breathed deep and tried to sort out my thoughts
someone had brought me here drugged arranged to keep me that way for how long i didnot know but i could check that by examining medicine supply
someone had also been tinkering with my memory the question of who and why needed answering
i made an effort to cut through the fog place an authentic recollection
it was june here i judged from the tender leaves and the budding roses
where had i been in may or last winter
icy streets tall buildings grim in the winter night but inside warmth cheer color the laughing faces of friendly people and the smile of a beautiful redhead named named i couldnot remember
the almostrecollection slipped away like a wisp of smoke in a sudden breeze
someone had done a good job using deep hypnotics no doubt of burying my recollections under a layer of false memories
still they hadnot done as well as they thought it had taken me only a few hours to throw off the nebulous impressions of a dubious past
perhaps i turned hurried back to the house
gunvor was hesitating over a plate of freshbaked pastries she ducked something under her apron as i stepped into the room
oh
ye startled me sir i went across and removed a saltshaker half filled with a coarse white powder from her hand tossed it into the basket
no more medicine i said gunvor
i patted her reassuringly know the doctor gave you instructions but i donot need it any more
but tell me is there a i groped for a word i didnot want to alarm her by asking for a brain doctor and she wouldnot understand psychiatrist hypnotist
i waited for signs of comprehension
someone who talks to troubled people soothes them ah ye mean a mesmerist
but theres none here in the village alas only mother goodwill she added doubtfully
mother goodwill
i prompted nothing against her mind ye sir but theres those that talk of witchcraft
and i was reading just the other day in the paris match that ye can develop serious neuroses by letting unqualified practitioners meddle with yer psyche so right gunvor i agreed
but its only a little matter of a faulty memory are ye troubled with that too sir her face lit up that forgetful meself sometimes i think i should have something done but then a regular mesmerists so dear and as for these quacks what about mother goodwill does she live near here at the other end of the village sir
but i wouldnot recom38 mend her not for a cultured gentlemen like yerself
her cottage is very plain and the old woman herself is something less than a credit to our village
dowdy she is sir no sense of style at all
and as for clothes wonot be overly critical gunvor
will you take me to her summon her here sir if yere determined but theres a licensed master mesmerist in ealing just an hour by coach mother goodwill will do i think
how soon can you get her here send ingalill but if its all the same to ye sir let me have her up after dinner just popped me goose in and the pies are browning even now after dinner will be fine take a few more turns around the garden and develop an appetite worthy of your cooking
a fter a second slab of blackberry pie buried in cream too thick to pour a final mug of coffee and with a healthy snort of brandy with the flavor of a century in a dark cellar safely under my belt i lit up a new orleans cigar and watched as hilda and gunvor lit the oil lamps in the sitting room
there was a timid tap at the door and ingalill the kitchen slavey poked her face in
the old witch is here she piped
gunvor shes smoking a pipe
i think its got ground up salamander innards in it hear ye ye wretch hilda said
tell her to wait until her betters summon her ingalill yelped and jumped aside and a bentbacked ancient in a poke bonnet pushed in past her one gnarled hand gripping a crooked stick on which she leaned
bright black eyes darted about the room lit on me
i stared back taking in the warty nose toothless gums outthrust chin and wisp of white hair hanging beside one hollow cheek
i didnot see a pipe but as i watched she snorted a last wisp of smoke from her nostrils
who has need of mother healing touch she quavered
but of course itd be you sir whove come such a strange long way and with a stranger longer path still ahead phooie i told you it was the new gentleman ingalill said in the basket she reached to lift a corner of the red and white checked cloth covering the container yelped as the stick cracked across her knuckles
mind yer manners dearie mother goodwill said sweetly
she shuffled to a chair sank down put the basket on the floor at her feet
now mother goodwill gunvor said sounding agitated
the gentleman only wants a little help with draw aside the veil of the past the future to read more clearly the crone piped
ah he did well to call on old mother gee
now her tone became more brisk
if yell pour me a dram gunvor to restore me strength a mite and then yell all have to clear out except mlord the new gentleman o course
she grinned at me like a meateating bird not interested in the future i started are ye not sir the old woman nodded as though agreeing
then its a strange mortal ye are but there are some things i need to remember i bored on ignoring the sales pitch
maybe under light hypnosis i can so then its the past yed glimpse as i thought she commented imperturbably
gunvor was clicking glasses at the sideboard
she came over and handed the old woman a glass then got busy clearing dishes from the table with ingalill and hilda working silently beside her
mother goodwill smacked her lips over the brandy then waved an oversized brownspotted hand
away with ye now me chicks she quavered feel the spirit coming over me
the powers flowing in the celestial field39 coil
strange visions are stirring like phantom vipers in a pot this this
ai curious indeed the things the spirits whisper to me now hummp
ye can skip the spirits routine hilda said
all mr bayard wants from ye get along with ye girl the old woman snapped or send a cramp thatll lock yere knees together that tight the fairest swain this side o not unlock em all of ye off now hey went
then the hag turned to me
now down to business sir she used a wheedling tone
what were ye thinking of giving the old woman for a handful of lost recollections
is it a lover yeve forgot the raptures of youth the key to happiness once glimpsed and now forever gone aglimmering i was grinning at her be well paid but lets skip the rest of the routine get straight to the point i have reason to believe suffering from induced amnesia probably the result of posthypnotic suggestion like you to put me under and see if you counter the block
mother goodwill leaned forward looked at me keenly a strangeness about ye something i canot put me finger on its as though yer eyes were focussed on a horizon that other men canot see granted a strange character
but not so strange you canot hypnotize or mesmerize me i hope
ye say yeve been tampered with yer memories taken from ye done a thing like that to ye lad and why maybe if youre successful find out
she nodded briskly heard of such things spells of darkness cast by the light of a bloodred moon mother i cut in get one thing straight every time you mention spells magic dark powers or greases the fee goes down interested in straight scientific mesmerism
what good sir would ye tell the mistress of darkness how to ply her trade
the routine was beginning to get tiresome
maybe wed better forget the whole thing
i reached in my pocket for a coin
my mistake
are ye saying mother a fraud then her voice had taken on a suspiciously mild note
i looked at her caught a glint of light from an eye as black and bright as a polished opal think the old womans out to trick ye to play ye false to gull ye fer a new fledged chick to her voice droned on coming from far away now booming like surf in a seacave echoing echoing ten
my eyes snapped open
a woman with a pale almost beautiful face sat leaning pensively on one elbow a cigarette in her hand watching me
her dark hair was done up in a tight bun her plain white blouse was open at the collar showing a strong graceful neck
there was one dark curl against her forehead
i looked around the room it was dark outside now a clock was ticking loudly somewhere
what happened to the old beldame
i blurted
the woman smiled faintly waved a wellmanicured hand toward a black cape on the chair beside her a gnarled stick leaning again it
rather warm for working in
how are you feeling
i considered
fine
but i caught a glimpse of a wisp of stringy grey hair under the edge of the cloak
i got out of my chair went over and lifted it there was a warty rubber mask a pair of gnarly gloves the idea of the getup find it helpful in my business
now you fooled me in a bad light i said take it gunvor and the others are in on the gag she shook her head
no one ever sees me in a good light mr bayard and no one wishes to approach too close even then simple people here abouts in their thoughts warts and wisdom go together so i sedk to fit their image of a village mesmerist else none would seek my skill the only one who shares my little secret
why me
she looked at me searchingly
you are a most unusual man mr bayard
a true man of mystery
you talked to me of many things
strange things
things at which the mind reels
you spoke of other worlds like this our own familiar plane but different alien
you talked of men like animals clothed in shaggy hair dzok
i burst out
my hands went to my head as though to squeeze the recollections from my brain like toothpaste from a tube
the hagroon and calmly calmly mr bayard the woman soothed
your memories if true memories they are and not feverfancies are there intact ready to be recalled
rest now
it was not easy for either of us this stripping away of veils from your mind
a master mesmerist indeed was he who sought to bury your visions of strange paradises and unthinkable hells but all lies exposed now
i looked at her and she smiled am no journeyman practitioner myself she murmured
but all my skill was challenged this night
she rose went to a framed mirror on the wall gracefully tucked back a strand of hair
i watched her without seeing her thoughts of barbro the flaming figure in the dark storeroom the escape with dzok from the hagroon cell were jostling each other clamoring to be remembered thought about evaluated
mother goodwill plucked her cape from the chair swirled it about her shoulders hunching into the posture of the hag she had been
her white hands slipped the mask in place fitting it to her nose and mouth
the gloves and wig followed and now the bright eyes gazed at me from the wrinkled face of age
rest sir the ancient face cackled
rest sleep dream and let those restless thoughts seek out and know their familiar places once again attend ye on the morrow theres more that mother goodwill would learn of the universes yeve told me lurk beyond the threshold of the drab world
wait i said havenot paid you
she waved a veined hand paid me well in the stuff visions are wrought on sir
sleep i say and awake refreshed strong with your wits keened to razors edge
for yell be needing all yer strength to face what waits ye in the days yet undawned
she went out then i went along the hall to my dark room threw my clothes on a chair fell into the feathermattressed bed and sank down into troubled dreams was three days before i felt strong enough to pay my call on mother goodwill
her cottage was a thatchroofed rectangle of weathered whitewash almost lost under a tangle of wristsized rose vines heavy with deep red blossoms
i squeezed through a rusted gate picked my way along a path overhung with untrimmed rhododendron lifted the huge brass knocker clanked it against the low black oak door
through the one small manypaned window i caught a glimpse of the corner of a table a pot of forgetmenots a thick leatherbound book
there was a humming of bees in the air a scent of flowers and a whiff of freshbrewed coffee
certainly not the traditional setting for calling on a witch i thought
the door opened
mother goodwill looking neat in a white shirt and peasant skirt favored me with a sad smile motioning me in
no halloween costume today i commented feeling better mr bayard she said drily
will you have a mug of coffee
or isnot it customary in your native land
i shot her a sharp look
skeptical already
her shoulders lifted and dropped believe what my senses tell me
sometimes they seem to contradict each the other
i took a chair at the table glanced around the small room
it was scrupulously clean and tidy furnished with the kind of rustic authenticity that would have had the ladies of the back home oohing and ahing and overworking the word quaint
mother goodwill brought the pot over poured two cups put cream and sugar on the table then sat
well mr bayard is your mind clear this morning your remembrance well restored i nodded tried the coffee
it was good you have some other name i could call you
i asked
mother goodwill goes with the fright wig and the warts
you may call me olyvia
she had slim white hands and on one finger a fine green stone twinkled
she sipped her coffee and looked at me as though making up her mind to tell me something
you were going to ask me a question i prompted her
after answered them maybe youll clear up a few matters for me
many were the wonders you babbled of in your delerium she said
i heard a tiny clatter glanced at her cup a fine tremor was rattling it against the saucer
she put it down quickly ducked her hands out of sight
oft have i sensed that there was more to existence than this she waved a hand to take in everything
in dreams glimpsed enchanted hills and my heart yearned out to them and wake with the pain of something beautiful and lost that haunted me long after
i think in your wild talk there was that which made a certain hope spring up again a hope long forgotten with the other hopes of youth
now tell me stranger that talk of other worlds like each to other as newstruck silver pieces yet each with a tiny diffeience and of a strange coach with the power to fly from one to the next all this was fancy eh the raving of a mind sore vexed with meddling true olywia i cut in know its hard to grasp at first i seem to recall i was a bit difficult to convince once accustomed to thinking we know everything theres a powerful tendency to disbelieve anything that doesnot fit the preconception
you spoke of trouble brion she spoke my name easily familiarly i suppose sharing someones innermost thoughts tends to relax formalities
i didnot mind olyvia without her disguise was a charming woman in spite of her severe hairdo and prison pallor
with a little sunshine and just a touch of makeup i pulled myself back to the subject at hand listened attentively as i told her the whole story from strange interrogation to my sentencing by the xonijeelians
so stuck i finished
without a shuttle trapped here for the rest of my days
she shook her head are strange things brion things i should not believe so wild and fantastic are they
and yet i do believe
from what little learned of this worldline its backward technologically why were a very modern people olyvia said defensively
we have steam power the ships on the atlantic run make the crossing in nine days and there are the balloons the telegraph and telephone our modern coalburning road cars which are beginning to replace the horse in many parts of the colonies even sure i know olyvia no offense intended just say that in some areas were ahead of you
the imperium has the drive my own native world has nuclear power jet aircraft radar and a primitive space program
here youve gone in other directions
the point is stranded here exiled me to a continuum i can never escape from
is it so ill then brion
you have a whole world here before you and now that the artificial barriers have been cleansed from your mind youll freely recall these wonders you left behind
she was speaking eagerly now excited at the prospect
you spoke of aircraft build one how marvelous to fly in the sky like a bird
your coming here could mean the dawn of a new age of glory for the empire i said ungraciously great
but what about world
by now the hagroon have probably launched their attack and maybe succeeded with it
my wife may be wearing chains now instead of pearls
i got up stamped over to the window and stared out
while i rot here in this backwater world
brion she said softly behind me
you find yourself troubled not so much by the threat to your beloved friends as by the quality of remoteness these matters have taken on i turned
what do you mean remote
barbro my friends in the hands of these apemen those who tampered with your mind brion sought to erase these things from your memory
true my skill availed to lift the curse but tis no wonder that they seem to you now as old memories a tale told long ago
and i myself gave a command to you while yet you slept that the pain of loss be eased the pain of loss be damned
if i hadnot been fool enough to trust dzok poor brion
know you not yet it was he who gulled you while you slept planted the desire to go with him to xonijeel
yet he did his best for you or so your memory tells could have taken the shuttle back i said flatly
at least have been there to help fight them off
and yet the wise ones the monkeymen of xonijeel told that this world did not exist crazy
i took a turn up and down the room too much here i donot understand olyvia like a man wandering in the dark banging into things that he canot quite get his hands on
and now i raised my hands and let them fall suddenly inexpressibly weary
you have your life still ahead brion
you will make a new place for yourself here
accept that which cannot be changed back and sat down
a olyvia i havenot asked gunvor and the others many questions i didnot want to arouse curiosity by my ignorance
the indoctrination dzok and his boys gave me didnot cover much just enough to get me started
i suppose they figured get to a library and brief myself
tell me something about this world fill me in on your history to start with
she laughed an unexpectedly merry sound
how charming brion to be called upon to describe this humdrum old world as though it were a dreamers fancy a mighthavebeen instead of dull reality
i managed a sour smile always a little dull to whoevers involved in it
where shall i begin
with ancient rome
the middle ages
the first thing to do is establish a common history date the point at which your worlds history diverged from mines
you mentioned the empire
what empire
when was it founded
why the empire of france of course olyvia blinked then shook her head
but then nothing is of course she said speak of the empire estabblished by bonaparte in so far so good i said
we had a bonaparte too
but his em45 pire didnot last long
he abdicated and was sent off to elba in yes but he escaped returned to france and led his armies to glorious victory i was shaking my head
he was free for a hundred days until the british defeated him at waterloo
he was sent to st helena and died a few years later
olyvia stared at me
how strange how eerie and how strange
the emperor napoleon ruled in splendor at paris for twentythree years after his great victory at brussels and died in at nice
he was succeeded by his son louis the duke of reichstadt
no the duke died in his youth of consumption
louis was a boy of sixteen the son of the emperor and the princess of denmark
and his empire still exists i mused
after the abdication of the english tyrant george the british isles were permitted to enter the empire as a special ward of the emperor
after the unification of europe enlightenment was brought to the asians and africans today they are semiautonomous provinces administered from paris but with their own local houses of deputies empowered to deal with internal matters
as for new france or louisiana this talk of rebellion will soon die down a royal commission has been sent to look into the complaints against the viceroy think weve got the date pretty well pinned down i said and it looks as though theres been no significant scientific or technological progress since his prompted questions which i answered at length
olyvia was an intelligent and welleducated woman she was enthralled by my picture of a world without the giant shadow of bonaparte dominating it
the morning had developed into the drowsy warmth of noon by the time i finished
olyvia offered me lunch and i accepted
while she busied herself at the woodburning stove i sat by the window sipping a stone mug of brown beer looking out at this curious anachronistic landscape of tilled fields a blacktopped road along which a horse pulled a rubbertired carriage the white and red dots of farmhouses across the valley
there was an air of peace and plenty that made my oddly distant recollection of the threat to the imperium seem as olyvia said like a half forgotten story read long ago like something in the book lying on the table
i picked up the fat red leather bound volume glanced at the title by lyman baum funny i said
olyvia glanced over at the book in my hands smiled almost shyly
strange reading matter for a witch you think
but on these fancies my own dreams sometimes love to dwell brion
as i told you this one narrow world seems not enough not that olyvia but weve pretty well established that our date is early in the nineteenth century but baum wasnot born until about or so nearly half a century later
but here he is i flipped the book open noted the publisher wiley cotton new york new orleans and paris and the date you know this book in your own strange world
olyvia asked
i shook my head
in my world he never wrote this one i was admiring a frontispiece by denslow showing a figure facing a group of gnomes
the next page had an elaborate initial at the top followed by the words summoned you here said sorana the sorceress to tell you it was my favorite book as a child olyvia said
but if you know it not how then do you recognize the authors name
he wrote others
the wizard of oz was the first book i ever read all the way through
the wizard of oz
not the sorceress
how enchanting it would be to read it is this the only one he wrote sadly yes
he died the following year that could mean i trailed off
the fog that had been hanging over my mind for the days since i had awakened here was rapidly dissipating in the brisk wind of a sudden realization dzok and his friends had relocated me complete with phony memories to replace the ones theyd tried to erase in a worldline as close as possible to my own been clever thorough and humane but not quite as clever as they thought a bit less thorough in their research than they should have been and altogether too humane
i remembered the photodiagram the councillors had shown me and the glowing point unknown to imperial net cartographers which represented a fourth undiscovered world lying within the blight
i had thought at the time that it was an error along with the other greater error that had omitted the zerozero line of the imperium but it had been no mistake
four existed a world with a common history date far more recent than the 15th century the date of the closest lines beyond the blight
and i was there or here in a world where in at least one man known in my own world had existed
and if one why not another or two others maxoni and cocini inventors of the drive mean what brion voice jarred me back to the present
nothing
just a thought
i put the book down suppose its only natural that even fifty years after a major divergence not everything would have been affected
some of the same people would be born
brion olyvia looked at me across the room wonot ask you to trust me but let me help you
help me with what
i tried to recapture the casual expression been wearing up until a moment before but i could feel it freezing on my face like a mud pack
you have made a plan i sense it
alone you cannot succeed
there is too much that is strange to you here too many pitfalls to betray you
let me lend you what help i can
why should you want to help me if i were planning something
she looked at me for a minute without answering her dark eyes wide in her pale classic face spent my life in search for a key to some other world some dreamworld of my mind
somehow you seem to be a link brion
even if i can never go there it would please me to know helped someone to reach the unattainable shore all worlds just like this one olyvia
some better some worse some much much worse all made up of people and earth and buildings the same old natural laws the same old human nature
you canot find your dreamworld by packing up and moving on youve got to build it where you are
and yet i see the ignorance the corruption the social and moral decay the lies the cheats the treachery of those who hold the trust of the innocent sure and until weve evolved a human society to match our human intelligence those things will exist
but give us time olyvia weve only been experimenting with culture for a few thousand years
a few thousand more will make a lot of difference
she laughed
you speak as though an age were but a moment
compared with the time it took us to evolve from an amoeba to an ape or even from the first homo sapiens to the first tilled field it a moment
but donot give up your dreams theyre the force that carries us on toward whatever our ultimate goal is let me lend that dream concrete reality
let me help you brion
the story they told me that you had fallen ill from overwork as an otficial of the imperial colonial office that you were here for a rest cure tis as thin as a parisian nightdress
and brion she lowered her voice are watched
watched
by who a little man with a beard and dark glasses tis no jest brion i saw a man last night lurking by the gate at house and half an hour since a man well muffled up in scarves passed in the road yonder as you supped coffee
that doesnot prove anything
she shook her head impatiently
you plan to fly i know that
i know also that your visit to me will arouse the curiosity of those who prison you here prison me
why as free as a bird you waste time brion she cut me off
what deed you committed or why i know not but in a contest between you and drab officialdom support your cause
now quickly brion
where will you go
how will you travel what plan will hold on olyvia jumping to conclusions and jump you must if youd evade the hounds of the hunter
i sense danger closing about you as a snare about the roebucks neck told you olyvia i was exiled here by the xonijeelian council they didnot believe my story or pretended not to
they dumped me here to be rid of me they fancy themselves as humane you know
if theyd meant to kill me they had every opportunity to do so they sought to mesmerize your knowledge of the past away now they watch their results to judge
and when they see you restive familiar of a witch no witch as such all know me here
twas an ill gambit that brought you here by daylight brion if crept out at midnight theyd have seen me anyway if theyre watching me as you seem to think and theyd have known damned well i wasnot satisfied with their handpainted picture of my past
at any case theyll like it not come again take you away and once again essay to numb your knowledge of the worlds and of your past
i thought that over
they might at that i said donot suppose it was any part of their relocation program to have me spreading technical knowledge among the primitives
where will you go brion
i hesitated but what the hell olyvia was right i had to have help
and if she intended to betray me she had plenty on me already
rome i said
she nodded
very well
how is the state of your purse have a bank account leave that
luckily i have my store of gold napoleons buried in the garden donot want your money nonsense both need it going with you
you canot can and will she said her dark eyes alight make ready brion
we leave this very night is crazy i whispered to the dark hooded figure standing beside me on the shadowed path no reason for you to get involved in this hush olyvia said softly
now he grows restless
see him there
i think hell cross the road now more closely to spy us out
i watched the dense shadows made out the figure of a man he moved off crossed the road a hundred yards below the cottage disappeared among the trees on our side
i shifted my weight carefully itching under the wild getup oylvia had assembled for me warty face gnarly hands stringy white hair and all
i looked like mother older brother as illtempered an old duffer as ever gnashed his gums at the carryingson of the younger generation
olyvia was done up like belle watling in three layers of paint a fancy red wig a purple dress that fit her trim figure like wet silk and enough rings beads and tinkly earring to stock a gift shop
hist he steals closer now my coconspirator whispered
another half minute i waited listening to the monotonous chirrup of crickets in a nearby field the faraway oomau of a cow the yapping of a farm dog
after dark the world belonged to the animals hand touched mine
now i followed as she stepped silently off i had to crouch slightly to keep below the level of the ragged hedge
there was no moon only a little faint starlight to help us pick a way along the rutted dirt road
we reached the end of the hedge and i motioned olyvia back stole a look back toward the house
a head was clearly silhouetted against the faint light from the small side windaw
i said in a low voice at the window there was a crunch of gravel and a light snapped on played across the ruts flashed over me settled on olyvia here woman a deep voice growled ye doing abroad after olyvia planted a hand on her hip tossed her head not neglecting to smile archly
aoow capting she purred
ye fair give me a turn only me old gaffer what oim seein orf to the riletrine
gaffer is it
the light dwelt on me again briefly went back to caress sequinned bosom seen ye about the village before
where ye from float about as ye might say major
a tourist like ye might call me on shanks mare in the middle of the night
queer idea o fun i call it and with yer gaffer too
better let me see yer identity papers ducks
well as it appens i come away in such a rush they seem to ave got left behind like that is it
i heard a snort from the unseen man behind the light one of the roving security police who were a fixture of this world i guessed
run off with a fistful o spoons did ye
or maybe lifted one purse too many nofink o that sort
what cheek an honest licensed tart plying er profession and keeping her old gaffer what oim the sole support of never mind love i wonot take ye in
a wee sample of yer wares and forget i ever saw ye
he came close and a big hand reached out toward oljrvia
she let out a short squeak and jumped back
the cop brushed past me i caught a glimpse of a tricorn hat a beak nose loose jowls a splash of color on the collar of the uniform i picked my spot chopped down hard across the base of his neck with the side of my hand
he yelped dropped the light stumbled to hand and knees the stiff collar had protected him from the full force of the blow
he scrambled trying to rise i followed kicked him square under the chin he backflipped and sprawled out unconscious
i grabbed up the light and found the switch flicked it off
is he badly hurt
olyvia was staring at the smear of blood at the corner of the slack mouth have trouble asking for bribes for a few weeks i pulled olyvia back toward the hedgerow hope our snooper did not hear anything
we waited for a minute then started off again hurrying now
far away a spark of wavering yellowish light moved across the slope of the hill beyond the village the train olyvia said have to hurry we walked briskly for fifteen minutes passed the darkened shops at the edge of town reached the station just as the puffing coalburner pulled in
a severelooking clerk in a dark uniform with crossed chest straps and coat tails accepted money wrote out tickets by hand pointed out our car
inside we found wide seats upholstered in green plush
we were the only passengers
i leaned back in my seat with a sigh
the trains whistle shrilled a lurch ran through the car on our way olyvia breathed
she looked ecstatic like a kid at the fair just going to rome i said
not the land of oz
who can say she said whither the road of the future leads
a the albergo romulus olyvia and i had adjoining rooms well up under the eaves with ceilings that slanted down to a pair of dormer windows opening onto a market place with a handsome rennaissance fountain the incessant flutter of pigeons wings and a day and night shrilling of excited italian voices
we were sitting at the small table in my room eating a late breakfast of pizzas procured at the corner emporium washed down with a musty red wine that cost so little that even the local begging corps could afford to keep a mild buzz on most of the time
the two men interested in were born somewhere in northern italy about i told olyvia
they came to rome as young men studied engineering and electronics and in made the basic discovery that gave the imperium the net drive gambling that if baum managed to get himself born and in the nineties was writing something pretty close to what he did in my world and in the too then maybe maxoni and cocini existed here too they didnot perfect the drive obviously or if they did the secret died with them but maybe they came close maybe they left something i can use
brion did you not tell me that all the worlds that lie about your line are desolate blasted into ruin by these very forces is it safe to tamper with such fell instruments as these a fair shuttle technician olyvia i know most of the danger points
maxoni and cocini didnot realize what they were playing with they stumbled on the field by blind luck and in a thousand million other worlds of they failed and brought ruin in their wake you knew all this when we left harrow i said shortly my only chance and a damned poor chance it is admit
but i canot build a shuttle from scratch theres a speciallywound coil thats the heart of the fieldgenerator installed em but i never tried to wind one
maybe if there was a maxoni here and a cocini and they made the same chance discovery and they wrote up their notes like good little researchers and the notes still exist and i can find them olyvia laughed a charming girlish laugh
if the gods decree that all those ifs are in your favoi why then tis plain they mean you to press on risk it brion
the vision of the sapphire city still beckons me the emerald city where i come from i said
but we wonot quibble over details see if we can find those notes first well have plenty of time then to decide what to do with them
a hour later at the local equivalent of a municipal record center a tiredlooking youth in a narrowcut black suit showed me a threefoot wide ledger in which names were written in spidery longhand in faded ink thousands of names followed by dates placesofbirth addresses and other pertinent details
securo signore he said in a tone of weary superiority the municipality having nothing to hide throws open to you its records among the most complete archives in existence in the empire but as for reading them he smirked tweaked his hairline mustache
that the signore must do for himself
just explain to me what looking at i suggested gently looking for a record of guilio maxoni or carlo cocini yes yes so you said and here before you is the registration log in which the names of all new arrivals in the city were recorded at the time identity papers were issued
they came to rome in you said or was it you seemed uncertain
as for me he spreads his hands am even more uncertain
i have never heard of these relatives or friends or ancestors or whatever they might be
in them you it appears have an interest
as for me i have none
there is the book covering the decade in question
look all you wish
but do not demand miracles of me
i have duties to perform
his voice developed an irritated snap on the last words
he favored me with what he thought was a piercing look and strutted oflf to sulk somewhere back in the stacks i grunted and started looking
twenty minutes passed quietly
we worked our way through started on the busy archivist peered out once to see what we were doing withdrew after a sour look
olyvia and i stood at the wooden counter poring over the crabbed longhand each taking one page of about two hundred names
she was a fast reader before i had finished my page she had turned to the next
half a minute later she gave a sharp gasp
brion
look
guilio majtoni born at paglio trade artificer i looked
it was the right name i tried not to let myself get too excited but my pulse picked up in spite of the voice of prudence whispering in my ear that there might be hundreds of maxonis
nice work girl i said in a cool controlled voice that only broke twice on the three words
what address
she read it off i jotted it down in a notebook i had thoughtfully provided for the purpose added the other data from the ledger
we searched for another hour but found no record of cocini had lived at number twelve
via carlotti fourth floor number nine
with the aid of a street map purchased from an elderly entrepreneur in a beret and a soiled goatee who offered us a discount on racy postcards which i declined with regret we found it a narrow alley choked with discarded paper cartons vegetable rinds overflowing garbage barrels and shoeless urchins who dodged madly among the obstacles cheerfully exchanging bandinage which would have made mussolini blush
number twelve was a faded late rennaissance front of rusticated granite wedged between sagging boardedup warehouses no more than a hundred or two years old
maxoni it appeared had started his career in the most modest quarters available even a century ago this had been a slum
i pushed open the door caked with cracked paint stepped into a narrow hall reeking of garlic cheese decay and less pleasant things
it looks terrible brion olyvia said
perhaps wed best make inquiries first a door opened and a round olivered face set in cushions of fat looked out launched a stream of rapid italian
your pardon
madam i replied in the courtly accents i had learned from the roman ambassador to the imperial court
we are but foreigners visiting the eternal city for the first time
we seek the apartment where once our departed relative dwelt long ago when the gods favored him with the privilege of breathing the sweet air of sunny italy
her jaw dropped she stared then a grin the size of a tenlira pizza spread across her face
buon giomo
signore signorina
she squeezed out into the hall pumped our hands yelled instructions back into her flat from which a mouthwatering aroma of ravioli emanated and demanded to know how she could serve the illustrious guests of fair italy
i gave her the number of the apartment where maxoni had lived ninetyodd years before and she nodded started up the narrow stair puffing like the steamengine
olyvia followed and i trailed admiring the deposits of broken glass paper rags and assorted rubbish that packed every step and landing with a trail winding up through the center worn by the feet of centuries of tenants
i would have given odds that the bits maxoni might have contributed were still there somewhere
at the top we went along a narrow hall past batteredlooking doors with white china knobs stopped at the one at the end
there is a tenant
signore the landlady said
but he is away now at his job in the fish market that sophia gina anna maria scumatti procured for him believe me if i hadnot given him an ultimatum that the rent must be paid or out hed go hed be sleeping now snoring like a serviced sow while sophia gina undoubtedly the signora has to endure much from ungrateful tenants i soothed
i had a hundred lira note ready in my jacket pocket the same oddlycut number that had been in the closet at house
i fished the bill out tendered it with an inclination of the head
if the signora will accept this modest contribution mama scumatti puffed out her cheeks threw out her imposing bosom
it is my pleasure to serve the guest of italy she started i pulled the bill back but let it not be said that sophia gina anna maria scumatti was ungracious fat fingers plucked the note from my hand dropped it into a cleavage like the grand canyon
would the signore and signorina care to enter
she fumbled a threeinch key from a pocket jammed it in a keyhole you could have put a finger through twisted it threw the door wide
vidil i in at a collapsed cot snarled with dirty blankets a brokendown table strewn with garishly colored comics empty coffee cups stained fingergreased glasses and a halfloaf of drylooking bread
there was a bureau with a broken mirror with racing tickets tucked under the frame a wooden jesus dangling on the wall and an assortment of empty wine and liquor bottles bearing the labels of inferior brands scattered about the room in a careless way
the odor of the place was a sour blend of unlaundered bedding old socks and a distillery infested with mice
i looked at olyvia she gave me a cool smile turned to our hostess
may we go in
sophia gina wrinkled her brow at me
my sister would like to go inside and ah commune with the spirit of our departed progenitor i translated freely
the black unplucked eyebrows went up
but as the signore sees the room is occupied we wonot touch a thing just look at it
a very emotional moment for us you understand
a knowing look crept over the round face
she gave olyvia still wearing her makeup and rings an appraising onceover then looked me in the eye one eyelid dipped in an unmistakable wink
ah but naturally
signore
you and your sister would of course wish to commune in private
another hundred lira please
she was suddenly brisk
i forked over silently trying to look just a little hangdog dislike to hurry the signore the concierge said as she shook the second note down into the damp repository
but try to finish in say two hours si
there is the chance that gino will be back for lunch
an elbow the size and texture of a football dug into my side two fat brokennailed hands outlined an hourglass in the air two small black eyes rolled then mama scumatti was waddling off a hippo in a black skirt
what said the fat scoundrel
olyvia demanded
just admiring your figure i said hastily take a look around and see what clues we can turn up
half an hour later olyvia stood in the center of the room still wrinkling her nose hands on hips a lock of hair curling down over her damp forehead
it was a hopeless quest from the first she said be off before my stomach rebels
i dusted off my hands grimy from groping on the backs of shelves and under furniture looked in all the obvious places i said
but what about the unlikely spots
we havenot checked for loose floorboards se56 cret panels fake pictures on the wall tis a waste of time brion this man was not a conspirator to squirrel away his secrets in the mattress he was a poor young student nought more living in a rented room thinking of little things he might have dropped a bit of paper that could have gotten stuck in the back of a drawer maybe
nobody ever cleans this place theres no reason something like that couldnot still be there even after all these years where had the drawers out rooted in the base of the chest lifted that ragged scrap of rug probed behind the baseboard she trailed off her eyes were on the boxedin radiator set under the one small window
the wooden panels were curled split loosefitting
we both moved at once olyvia deftly set aside the empty chianti bottles and the tin can half full of cigarette butts i got a grip on the top board lifted gingerly
the whole assembly creaked moved out
jnst a couple of rusty nails holding it i said lever it free a minute later with the help of a wooden coathanger lettered albergo torino roma i had eased the housing away from the wall revealing a rusted iron radiator a few inches of piping enough dustdevils to fill a shoe box and a drift of cigaret butts ticket stubs bits of string hairpins a playing card paper clips and papers oooed went to her knees i watched as she blew dust aside fished out a folded menu half a sheet of yellowed paper with numbers scribbled on it an envelope with a postmark in the twenties addressed to one mario pinotti two postcards with faded photos of local tourist spots and a brittle square of paper blank on both sides
it was a good idea i said
too bad it didnot pan out
silently i replaced the cover put the bottles and ashtray back
you were right olyvia lets get back out in the street where we can get a nice wholesome odor of fresh garbage brion look
olyvia was by the window turning the blank scrap of paper at an angle to catch the sun
the ink has faded but there was something written here i came over squinted at the paper
there were the faintest of faint marks visible
olyvia put the paper on the table rubbed it gently over the dusty surface then held it up to the mirror
the ghostly outline of awkward penmanship showed as a grey line
rub it a little more i said tensely
careful that papers brittle as ash she complied held it to the mirror again
this time i could make out letters instituzione galileo mercolidi giugno wednesday june 7th i translated
this just might be something useful
i wonder what year that was know a simple formula for calculating the day on which a given date must fall olyvia said breathlessly
it will take but a moment she nibbled at her lip frowning in concentration
suddenly her expression lightened
yes
it fits
june fell on a wednesday
she frowned
as did that date in something thats better than nothing at all check it out
the galileo institute lets hope its still in business
a little man in armbands and an eyeshade nibbled a drooping yellowed mustache and listened in silence his veined hands resting on the countertop as though holding it in place as a barrier against smoothtalking foreign snoopers that was a considerable time in the past he announced snappishly
there have been many students at the institute since then many illustrious scientists have passed through these portals bringing glory to the name of the galileo
an odor of cheap wine drifted across from his direction
apparently we had interrupted his midmorning snort not applying for admission i reminded him
you donot have to sell me
all i want is a look at the record of giulio maxoni
of course if your filing system is so fouled up you canot find it you can just say so and report the fact in the article writing you aie a journalist
he straightened his tie gave the mustache a twirl and eased something into a drawer out of sight behind the counter with a clink of glass
just give me the same treatment youd accord any humble seeker after facts i said loftily
after all the public is the owner of the institute surely it should receive the fullest attention of the staff whose bread and vino are provided by the publics largesse that got to him he made gobbling sounds hurried away came back wheezing under a volume that was the twin to the municipal register slammed it down on the counter blew a cloud of dust in my face and lifted the cover
maxoni you said sir he paused popped his eyes at me
that wouldnot be maxoni his natural suspicious look was coming back
ahhh a variety of sudden emotions were hostling each other for space on my face
maxoni i prompted
maxoni the celebrated inventor he snapped
he turned and waved a hand at a framed daguerrotype one of a long sombre row lining the room of the maxoni churn the maxoni telegraph key the maxoni improved galvanic buggy whip it was that which made his fortune of course i smiled complacently like an inspector whos failed to find an error in the voucher files
very good
i see youre on your toes here at the institute just have a look at the record and then i let it trail off as smiley spun the book around pointed out a line with a chewed fingernail
here it is right here his original registration in the college of electrics
he was just a lad from a poor farming community then it was here at the institute that he got his start
we were one of the first of course to offer lectures in electrics
the institute was one of the sponsors of the telegraphic conference later in that same year he rattled on with the sales pitch that had undoubtedly influenced many an old alumnus or wouldbe patron of the sciences to fork over that extra bundle while i read the brief entry
the address in the via carlotti was given the fact that maxoni was twentyfour a catholic and single
not much help there
is there any record i inquired as to where he lived after he made his pile the little nian stiffened
made his pile sir
i fear i do not understand made his great contribution to human culture i mean i amended
surely he didnot stay on at the via carlotti very long
a sad smile twitched at one corner of the registrars tight mouth
surely the gentleman jests the location of the museum is i think well known even to tourists
what museum
the gnome spread his hands in a gesture as roman as grated cheese
what other than the museum housed in the former home and laboratory of guilio maxoni
the shrine wherein are housed the relics of his illustrious career
beside me olyvia was watching the mans face wondering what we were talking about
pay dirt i said to her
then you donot have the address of this museum handy by any chance
this netted me a superior smile
a skinny finger pointed at the wall beside him
number twentyeight strada one square east
any child could direct you in business girl i said to olyvia
ah what was the name of the paper you ah claim to represent the little mans voice was a nice mixture of servility and veiled insolence
he was dying to be insulting but wasnot quite sure it was safe with the temperance league i said and sniffed loudly
the maxoni questions were just a dodge of course doing a piece entitled drinking on duty and what it costs the taxpayer
he was still standing in the same position goggling after us when we stepped out into the bright sunshine he maxoni house was a conservative stonefronted building that would have done credit to any street in the east seventies back home
here was a neglectedlooking brass plate set above the inner rail beside the glass panelled door announcing that the home and laboratories of the renowned inventor guilio maxoni were maintained by voluntary contributions to the society for the preservation of monuments to the glory of italy and were open from monday through saturday and on sundays from a cardboard placard taped to the glass invited me to ring the bell
i did
time passed
a dim shape moved beyond the glass bolts rattled the door creaked open and a frowzy sleepblurred face blinked out closed
go away a voice like the last whinny of a dying plow horse said
i got a foot into the narrowing space between the door and the jamb
the sign says i started brightly
forget the sign the blurry face wheezed
come back tomorrow i put a shoulder against the door bucked it open sending the charming receptionist reeling back
she caught her balance hitched up a sagging bra strap and raised a hand fingers spread palm facing her opened her mouth to demonstrate what was probably an adequate command of roman idiom ah ah donot say it i cautioned her
the contessa here is unaccustomed to the vigor of modern speech shes led a sheltered life tucked away there in her immense palazzo at lake constance contessa
a hideous leer that was probably intended as a simper contorted the sagging face
oh my if i only wouldve known her grace was honoring our little shrine with a visit she fled portal guarded by a dragon olyvia said
and the fair knight puts her to rout with but a word used a magic spell on her promoted to contessa now just smile distantly and act aloof
i looked around the room it was a standard entry hall highceilinged creamcolored with a stained glass window shedding colored light across a threadbare oncefine rug picking up highlights on a marbletopped table in need of dusting twinkling in the cutglass pendants of a rather nice victorian chandelier
a wide carpeted stairway led up to a sunlit landing with another stainedglass panel a wide arched opening to the left gave a view of a stuffylooking library with a heavy table with pots of wax flowers and an open book with a pen and inkpot beside it
there were rows of shelves sagging under rows of dusty books uncomfortable looking horsehair chairs and sofas a fireplace with tools under a mantel on which china gimcracks were arranged in an uneven row
looks like maxoni went in for bourgeois luxury in a large way once he got onto the buggywhip boom i commented wonder where the lab is olyvia and i wandered around the room smelling the odor of age and dust and furniture polish i glanced over a few of the titles on the shelves experiments with alternating currents of high potential and high frequency by nikola tesla caught my eye and a slim pamphlet by marconi otherwise the collection seemed to consist of good solid victorian novels and bound volumes of sermons
no help here he dragon came back looking grotesque in a housecoat of electric green a tribute to field of research no doubt
a layer of cakeylooking makeup had been hastily slapped across her face and a rosebud mouth drawn on by a shaky hand
she laced her fingers together did a curtsey like a trained elephant gushed at oljrvia who inclined her head an eighth of an inch and showed a frosty smile
this example of aristocratic snobbishness delighted the old girl she beamed so hard i thought the makeup was going to crack like plaster in an earthquake
a wave of an economical perfume rolled over me like a dust storm
her grace wished to see the laboratories where maxoni did his great work i announced fanning
you may show us there at once
she shouldered in ahead of me to get a spot nearer the contessa and with much waving of ringed hands and trailing of fringes conducted us along a narrow hall beside the staircase through a door into a weedy garden along a walk to a padlocked shed chattering away the whole time
of course the workrooms are not yet fully restored she fluttered hauling a key from a baggy pocket
she got the lock open stopped as she groped inside grunted as she found the light switch
a yellowish glow sprang up
olyvia and i stared in at dust lumpy shapes covered with tarpaulins dust heaped carton dust grimed windows and dust
he worked of course it was not so cluttered then short of funds you see your grace she got the sell in
we havenot yet been able to go through the items here and catalogue them dispose of the worthless things and restore the laboratory to its original condition she chattered on unabashed by silence
i poked around trying to look casual but feeling far from calm
it was in this shed or a near facsimile that maxoni had first made the breakthrough that had opened the worlds of alternate reality
somewhere here there might be something i did not know what i was looking for a journal a working model not quite perfected i lifted the corner of the dust cover over a heaped table glanced at the assortment of ancient odds and ends awkward heavylooking transformers primitive vacuum tubes bits of wire a massive object at the center of the table caught my eye
i lifted the cover reached for it dragged it to me
really sir i must insist that you disturb nothing my guardian hippo brayed in my ear
i jumped let the tarp fall dust whoofed into the air this is just as the professor left it that last fatal day
sorry i said holding my face in what i hoped was a bland expression
looks like a collection of old iron to me
yes professor maxoni was a bit eccentric he saved all sorts of odd bits and pieces and he was forever trying to fit them together had a dream he used to tell my departed papa when he was alive of course the professor i mean and papa too of course your father worked for maxoni you know
oh yes he was his assistant for ever so many years
many the anecdote he could tell of the great man donot suppose hes alive
papa
dear papa passed to his reward fortythree or is it fortyfour he didnot leave a journal i suppose filled with jolly reminiscenses of the professor
no papa wasnot what youd call a litry man
she paused
of course the professor himself was most diligent about his journal
five big volumes its one of the great tragedies of the society that weve not yet had sufficient funds to publish
funds may yet be forthcoming madam i said solemnly
the contessa is particularly interested in publishing just such journals as you described
oh
the paintedon mouth made a lopsided to match the exclamation
your grace so if youd just fetch it along so that her grace can glance over it i left the suggestion hanging in the safe sir but i have the key i know i have the key somewhere
i had it only last year or was it the year before find it my good woman i urged
her grace and i will wait patiently here thrilling to the thought that it was in this very room that the professor developed his galvanic buggywhip
oh no that was before he took this house no matter the journals please you rather come back inside the dust here as i said were thrilling to it
hurry back i waved her through the door
olyvia looked at me questioningly sent her off to find journals i said
she must have noticed something in my voice
brion what is it i stepped to the table threw back the cover
the heavy assembly i had moved earlier dominated the scattering of articles around it
that i said letting the note of triumph come through is a coil the central component of the drive
if i canot build a shuttle with that and the old boys journals turn in my badge he workshop i rented was a space under a loft opening off a narrow alleyway that wound from the strada d allenzo to a sidebranch of the tiber a trail that had probably been laid out by goats back before rome was big enough to call itself a town
the former occupant had been a mechanic of sorts there were rusty pieces of steamengine still lying in the corners a few corroded handtools resting among the dustdrifts on the sagging wallshelves at one side of the room odds and ends of bolts and ers and metal shavings trodden into the oilblack dirt floor
the old fellow who leased the premises to me had grumblingly cleared away the worst of the rubbish and installed a large battered metaltopped table
this plus the moebius coil which i had bribed the keeper of the flame into letting me borrow and the journals constituted my lab equipment
not much to start moving worlds with but still a start
olyvia had gotten us rooms nearby cheaper and better quarters than the albergo romulus
there was a small hotplate in her room charcoalfired we agreed to husband our meagre funds by having two meals a day in and the other one at one of the small neighborhood pasta palaces where the carafes of wine were put on the table as automatically as salt and pepper back home
i started my research program by reading straight through all five journals most of which were devoted to bitter comments on the current political situation the capitol had just been moved to rome from florence and it was driving prices up notes on some seemingly pointless researches into magnetism the details of a rather complicated but strictly platonic affair with a signora and worried budgetary computations that enlisted ray fullest sympathy
only in the last volume did i start to strike interesting passage the first tentative hints of the big secret
maxoni had been experimenting with coils winding them passiing various types and amounts of electric current through them and attempting to detect results
if hed known more modern physics hed never have bothered but in his ignorance he persevered
like edison trying everything from horsehair to bamboo splints as filaments for his incandescent bulb maxoni doggedly tried tested noted results and tried again
it was the purest of pure research he didnot know what he was looking for and when he found it he hadnot known what it was at least not in this world
of course there had been no cocini here
i didnot know what the latters role had been back in the world line it would be an interesting piece of reading for me when i got back if i got back that is if there were any place to get back to i let that line of thought die it wasnot getting me anywhere
the last volume of the journal yielded up its secrets such as they were a few scattered and fragmentary mentions of the coil winding and a line or two regarding strange manifestations obtained with the goldleaf electroscope when certain trickle currents were use
a had gone by and i was ready to start the experimental phase
there were a few electrical supply houses in the city mostly purveyors to the universities and research institutes electricity was far from the reddy kilowatt stage in this world
i laid in a variety of storage batteries oscillators coils condensers vacuum tubes as big and clumsy as milk bottles plus whatever else looked potentially useful
then at suggestion she mesmerized me took notes as i repeated everything my subconscious had memorized from the training had in net shuttle technology which turned out to be twice as valuable as notes
they were pleasant days i rose early joined olyvia for breakfast walked the two blocks to the shop and toiled until lunch recording my results in a book not much different from the ones maxoni had used a century earlier this was not a world of rapid change
olyvia would come by at noon or a little after looking fresh and cool and healthier now with the roman sun giving her face the color it had lacked back in harrow
the basket on her arm would produce sandwiches pizzas fruit a bottle of wine i had a couple of chairs by this time and wed spread our lunch on the corner of my formidable work bench with the enigmatic bulk of the coil lying before us like some jealous idol in need of placating
then an afternoon of cut and fit and note with curious passersby pausing at the open door to look in and offer polite greetings and shy questionings by the time a month had passed i was deferred to by all the local denizens as a mad foreigner with more than a suggestion of the sorcerer about him
but they were friendly often dropping off a casual gift of a bottle or a salami or a wedge of pungent cheese with a flourish of roman compliments
each evening by the time the sun had dropped behind the crooked skyline across the way and the shop had faded into deep shadow hardly relieved by the single feeble lamp i had strung up my eyes would be blurring my head ringing my legs aching from the hours of standing hunched over the table
i would solemnly close the door attach the heavy padlock ignoring the fact that the door was nothing but a few thin boards hung from a pair of rusted hinge held in place by bent nails then the walk home past the shops and stalls their owners busy closing up now up the stairs to the flat for a quick bath in the ruststained tub down the hall then out with olywia to the evenings treat
sitting at the wobbly tables on the tile floors often on a narrow terrace crowded beside a busy street we talked watched the people and the night sky then went back to part at the flat door she to her room i to mine
it was a curious relationship perhaps though at the time it seemed perfectly natural
we were coconspirators engaged in a strange quest halfdetectives half researchers set apart from the noisy crowd all around us by the fantastic nature of the wildly impractical dream we were embarked on she for reasons of romantic fulfillment and driven by a compulsion to tear through the intangible prison walls that had been dropped around me ir estimate of age had been steadily revised downward at first in the initial shock of seeing mother goodwill unmasked i had mentally assigned her a virginal fortyishness later bedizened in her harlots finery and enjoying every minute of the masquerade she had seemed younger perhaps thirtyfive i had decided
now with the paint scrubbed away her hair cut and worn in a casual roman style her complexion warm and glowing from the sun and the walks her figure as fine as ever in the neat inexpensive clothes she had bought in the modest shops near our flat i realized with a start one day watching her scatter bread crumbs for the pigeons behind the shop and laughing at their clumsy waddle that she was no more than in her middle twenties
she looked up and caught me staring at her a beautiful girl olyvia i said in a wondering tone afraid
what ever got you off on that mombi kick she looked startled then smiled a merrier expression than the lady look she used to favor guessed it she said sounding mischievous
the old witch in the sorceress of oz yes but why told you my business patronize a wise woman without warts on her chin sure but why havenot you married i started to deliver the old saw about there being plenty of nice young men but the look on her face saved me from that banality none of my business i said quickly didnot mean to get personal olyvia i trailed off and we finished our walk in a silence which if not grim was certainly far from companionable
three weeks more and i had assembled a formidable compilation of data enough i told oly66 via when she came to the shop at ten to see what had kept me to warrant starting construction of the secondary circuits the portion of the shuttle mechanism with which i was most familiar
the big job i said was to calibrate the coil find out what kind of power supply it called for what sort of field strength it developed
that parts done
now all i have to do is set up the amplifying and focussing apparatus you make it sound so simple trying to convince myself i admitted a long way from simple its a matter of trying to equate a complicated assemblage of intangible forces a little bit like balancing a teacup on a stream of water except that i have a couple of dozen teacups and a whole fire department worth of waterworks and if i threw full power to the thing without the proper controls then what
then set up an irreversible catyclysm of any one ef a hundred possible varieties
a titanic that keeps on exploding an uncontrolled eruption of matter from another continuum like a volcano pouring out of the heart of a sun er maybe an energy drain like niagara that would suck the heat away from this spot freeze the city solid in a matter of minutes put the whole planet under an icecap in a month
or tis sufficient i understand
these are fearsome forces you toy with brion worry i wonot pour the power to it until i know what doing
there are ways of setting up autotimed cutoffs for any test i run and be using trickle power for a long time yet
the disasters that made the blight happened because the maxonis and cocinis of those other werenot forewarned they set her up and let her rip
the door to hell has welloiled hinges
how long before youll finish few days
there isnot a hell of a lot to the shuttle build a simple box out of pine slabs if i have to just something to keep me and the mechanism together be a big clumsy setup of course not compacted like the imperial models but itll get me there as long as the power flows
the drain isnot very great
a stack of these six volt cells will give me all the juice i need to get me home
and if the xonijeel were right she said softly
if the world you seek lies not where you expect what then then run out of steam and drop into the blight and thatll be the end of another nut i said harshly
and a good thing too if i imagined the whole imperium know you didnot brion but if somehow something has gone wrong worry about that when i get to it i cut her off been plowing along wrapping myself up in my occupational therapy
i wasnot ready yet to think about the thousand gloomy possibilities have to face when i stepped into my crude makeshift and threw the switch
i was three evenings later and olyvia and i were sitting at a window table in one of our regular haunts having a small glass of wine and listening to the gentle night sounds of a city without neon and internal combustion been coming by the shop for me every evening lately a habit that i found myself looking forward to
it wonot be long now i told her
you saw the box just bolted together out of wood but good enough
the coils installed
tomorrow lay out my control circuitry brion her fingers were on my arm
look there i twisted caught a fleeting glimpse of a tall dark figure in a long fullskirted militarytype coat with the collar turned up pushing past through the sparse pedestrian traffic
it was him voice was tight with strain
all right maybe it was i said soothingly
take it easy girl
how sure are you sure brion
the same terrible dark face the beard there are plenty of bearded men in rome olyvia we have to go quickly she started to get up i caught her hand pulled her gently back
no use panicking
did he see us think not sure she finished saw him and turned my face away but if hes seen us if he is our boy running wonot help
if he didnot see us he wonot be back
but if we hurried brion we need not even stop at the flat to get our things we can catch the train be miles from rome by daylight if weve been trailed here we can be trailed to the next town
besides which theres the little matter of my shuttle nearly done another days work and a few tests of what avails the shuttle if they take you brion i patted her hand
why should anyone want to take me
i was dumped here to get rid of me brion think you some village goose to be coddled with this talk we must act now i chewed on my lip and thought about it
olyvia wasnot being soothed by my bland talk any more than i was
i didnot know what kind of followup the xoni68 jeelian web police did on their deportees but it was a cinch they wouldnot look kindly on my little home workshop project
the idea of planting me here had been to take me out of circulation theyd back their play olyvia was right about that
all right i got to my feet dropped a coin onthe table
out in the street i patted her hand
now you run along home olyvia do a little snooping just to satisfy myself that everythings then no stay with you silly i said
if there is any rough stuff you think i want you mixed up in it
not that there will be
you have some madcap scheme in mind brion what is it
will you go back to the workshop just want to check to make sure nobodys tampered with the shuttle
her face looked pale in the light of the carbide lamp at the corner
you think by hasty work to finish it to risk your life wonot take any risks olyvia but damned if going to be thwarted when this close need help not unclever in such matters
i shook my head
stay clear of this olyvia the one theyre interested in but you could get hurt how close are you to finishing your work few hours then some tests then wed best be starting i sense danger closeby this night
i hesitated for just a moment then took her hand donot know what done to earn such loyalty i said
come on weve got work to do went to the flat first turned on lights made coffee then with the rooms darkened took the back stairs eased out into a cobbled alley
half an hour later after a circuitous trip which avoided main streets and welllit corners we reached the shop slipped inside
everything looked just as left it an hour earlier the box its sides half slabbed up with boards the coil mounted at the center of the plank floor the bright wire of my halfcompleted control circuits gleaming in the gloom
i lit a lamp and we started to work
olyvia was more than clever with her hands
i showed her once how to attach wire to an insulator and she was better at it than i was
the batteries required a mounting box i nailed a crude frame together fitted the cells in place wired up a switch made connections
every half hour or so olyvia would slip outside make a quick reconnaisance not that it would have helped much to discover a spy sneaking up on us
i couldnot quite deduce the pattern of their tactics if any
if we had been spotted surely the shop was under surveillance
maybe they were just letting me finish before they closed in perhaps they were cuious as to whether it was possible to do what i was trying to do with the materials and technology at hand it was well after midnight when we finished
i made a final connection ran a couple of circuit checks if my research had been accurate and my recollection of theory correct the thing shovld work
it looks so fragile brion eyes were dark in the dim light
my own eyeballs felt as though theyd been rolled in emery dust fragile but a moving shuttle is immune to any external influence enclosed in a field that holds the air in and everything else out
and it doesnot linger long enough in any one for the external temperature or vacuum or what have you to affect it
brion
she took my arm fiercely
stay here
risk not this frail device tis not too late to flee let the evil men search in vain somewhere well find a cottage in some hamlet far from their scheming my expression told her she wasnot reaching me
she stared into my eyes for a moment then let her hand fall and stepped back was a fool to mingle dreams with drab reality she said harshly
i saw her shoulders slump the life go from her face
almost it was mother goodwill who stood before me
olyvia i said harshly for sake there was a sound from the door
i saw it tremble and jumped for the light flipped it off
in the silence a foot grated on bricks there was a sound of rusty hinges and a lesser darkness widened as the door slid back
a tall dark silhouette appeared in the opening
bayard a voice said sharply in the darkness an unmistakably xonijeelian voice
i moved along the wall the figure advanced
there was a crowbar somewhere near the door
i crouched trying to will myself invisible reached and my fingers closed around the cold rustscaled metal
the intruder was two yards away now i straightened raised the heavy bar he took another step and i jumped slammed the bar down solidly across the back of his head saw a hat fly as he stumbled and fell on his face with a heavy crash
brion
olyvia shrieked all right
i tossed the bar aside reached for her put my around her
you have to understand olyvia i rasped more at stake here than any ones dream this is something i have to do
you have your life ahead
live it and forget me
let me go with you brion she moaned
you know i canot
too dangerous and youd halve my chances of finding the line before the air gives out
i thrust my wallet into her cloak pocket have to go now
i pushed her gently from me
almost i hope it fails voice came through the dark
i went to the shuttle lit the carbide running light reached in and flipped the warmup switch
from the shadows i heard a groan from the creature i had stunned better go now olyvia i called
get as far away as you can go to louisiana start over forget the mother goodwill routine
the hum was building now the song of the tortured molecules as the field build twisting space warping time creating its tiny bubble of impossible tension in the massive fabric of reality
goodby olyvia
i climbed inside the fragile box peered at the makeshift panel
the field strength meter told me that the time had come
i grasped the drive lever and threw it in was a wrenching sation a sputter of arcing current through untried circuits then the walls flicked from view around me and i was looking out on the naked devastation of the blight
no need for viewscreens here the footwide gaps between the rough slats gave me a panoramic view of a plain of rubble glowing softly under the light of the moon a view that shifted and flowed as i watched blackening into burned ruins slumping gradually into a lavalike expanse of melted and hardened masonry and steel
i unclenched my teeth tried a breath everything seemed all right i was riding an eggcrate across hell but the field was holding leashed by the mathematical matrices embodied in a few hundred strands of wire strung just so from nail to nail around my wooden cage
the massive moebius coil bolted to the floor vibrated nervously the way my stomach felt
i made an effort to relax i had a long ride ahead and thered be plenty to be nervous about later on
my halfdozen juryrigged instruments were obediently giving readings i looked at the trembling needles and tried to think about what they represented
the only map i had was a fuzzy recollection of the photogram the xonijeelians had showed me
if this was a fourth island in the blight and i had already decided not to question that assumption then i was driving in what ought to be close to the correct direction
methods of navigation in the net depended on an orientation with an arbitrary set of standard values measurements of the strength of three of the seemingly infinite number of fields which were a normal part of the multiordinal continua
a reading of any three of these values should give a location noting the progressive changes in the interrelation of the values provided a plot across the net maybe
there was the little matter of calibrating my instruments determining how far my calculated orientation and vector varied from the actual estimating my velocity testing my crude controls to see how much steering i could do and determining how to bring the shuttle into identity square on target when and if i found a target and all of this before the air became too foul to breathe
there was no problem of food water or a place to sleep be dead long before any such luxuries became necessary
my first rough approximation from the data on the dials told me that i was moving along a vector at least degrees off the calculated one i made a cautious adjustment to one of my crude rheostats winced as the sparks flew watched the dials to see the results
they werenot good
either i was misinterpreting my readings or my controls were even worse than thought
i scribbled down figures made some hasty interpolations and came up with the discovery that i was blasting along at three times my calculated net velocity on a course that seemed to be varying progressively
my hastily rigged untested circuitry was badly out of balance not far enough out to spill the leashed entropic force in a wild torrent of destruction but too far out to be soothing
i made another haphazard adjustment checked readings the needles wavered one backtracking down the scale two others moving steadily upward
i made a herculean effort to recall all ever known about emergency navigation concluded that i had described most of a full circle and was now headed back in the general direction from which started
there wasnot much play left in my controls i pushed the lever which served as rudder all the way to the left watched as instruments responded not enough
i had a few wild thoughts of rerigging the strands of wire that constituted my shield against the boiling holocaust of uncontrolled volcanic destruction now churning and spewing black gas just beyond my latticework walls but gave that up quickly i couldnot shut down power for anything not here
another ten minutes passed my watch was ticking away measuring off some unimaginable quality in my timeless headlong plunge across the alternate realities
it was like the toothgritting wait while the lab technician probes around with his nefedle looking for a vein one second seemed to last forever
another reading no doubt about it now i was following a roughly spiral course whether descending or ascending i couldnot tell
the control circuits were sparking continously the stresses induced by the unnatural entropic loads were rapidly overheating the undersized wiring
a junction box tacked to a was glowing a dull red and the wood under it was smoking turning black
as i watched pale flames licked caught ran up the wood
i pulled off my highshouldered widelapelled jacket slapped at the fire uselessly
a wire melted through dropped spattered fire as it crossed other naked wires then hung welded into a new position
for a heartstopping instant i braced myself for the lurching drop into identity with the towering pillars of fire thundering silently outside then realized that miraculously the shuttle was still moving
i rubbed smokestung eyes checked dials the course had changed sharply
i tried to reconstruct the erratic path i had taken work out a deadreckoning of my position
it was hopeless
i could be anywhere
the scene beyond the shuttle walls was strange not like anything i remembered from blight exploration films seen
a row of steepsided black cones stretched away to the horizon each glowering dull red about its crater rim over which continuous wellings of lava spilled while vast bubbles burst sending up dense belches of brown smoke that formed a cloud obscuring the moon
here it appeared a new faultline had been created in the planets crust along which volcanos sprouted like weeds in a newploughed field
i had been on my way for about forty minutes now with a pang of homesickness i pictured olyvia back at the flat alone
suddenly i was remembering the days the evenings wed spent together her unfailing spirit the line of her throat and cheek as we sat at a table raising glasses in the long roman twilight i had had everything there a man needed for a good life maybe been a fool to exchange it for this a doomed ride on a hellbound train to nowhere
maybe
but there hadnot really been any choice
there were things in life a man had to do or the savor of the salt was gone forever
i lost now that was clear enough
for the last hour the shuttle had been charging across the continua blindly describing an erratic course which varied every time a connection fused and created a new pattern in the control circuits
the post was still smouldering and smoking using up my scant air and fouling what was left
i had stretched out on the floor some time earlier trying to find cleaner air it was about gone now i coughed with every breath and my head kept up a steady humming like a wornout transformer
i was picking up some interesting observations on the effects of modifying shuttle circuitry at full gallop and observing some new country never before explored by our net scouts but the chances of my surviving to use it were dwindling with each passing minute
i had scratched a few lines of calculations on the floor with a fragment of charred wood at the rate at which i was moving i was deep in the blight by now outside the ruined worlds flowed past a panorama of doomsdays
the volcanoes were gone shrunken to fiery pits that sparked and hurled fountains of fire into the black sky
i blinked peering through shrouding mists of steam and smoke far away a line of dark hills showed new hills created by the upheavals of this worlds crust
the smoke thinned for a moment gave me a clearer glimpse of the distant landscape was that a hint of green
i rubbed at my eyes stared some more
the hills dim in the moonlight seemed to show a covering of plant life the nearby fire pits seemed quieter now stilling to glowing pools of molten lava glazing over into dullness
and there a scraggly bush poking up at the rim of a crater and another
i drew a breath coughed got to hands and knees
the glow was fading from the scene now unmistakable pinpoints of bright green were showing up everywhere a shoot poked through the black soil rose twisted unfurled a frond shot up higher extending leaf after leaf in a speededup motionpicture sequence of growth each frame a glimpse of a different varying by a trifle from the next creating a continuous drama of change a change toward life
in its erratic wandering it appeared the shuttle had turned back now toward the edge of the blight
i watched saw new shoots appear spring up evolve into great treeferns giant cattails towering palmlike trunks along whose concretegrey surfaces vines crept like small green snakes to burgeon suddenly embrace the vast tree in a smothering outburst of green clamber over the crown then sink down as the tree died and fell only to turn on themselves mound high reach capture a new host a grew around me now nourished in the volcanic soil
orchids as big as dinner plates burst like popcorn dropped were replaced by other orchids as big as washtubs
in the bright moonlight i saw a flicker of motion a new kind of motion a moth appeared a bright spec grew until he was two feet across then the vast flower on which he perched closed over him in a frantic flurry of gorgeous wings and flamboyant petals
nearby a wall of foliage bulged burst outward
a head thrust through gaping jaws like an immense rat closed on vines that coiled choking
the head changed developed armor which grew out bladelike slicing through the ropes of living plantfibre juice oozed spilled thorns budded grew hungrily toward the animal reached the furred throat and recoiled blunted from armored hide
then new leaves unfolded reached to enfold the head wrapping it in smothering folds of leathery green it twisted fought tearing free only to be entoiled again sinking down now gone in a surging sea of green
i coughed choked got to my feet reached for the control panel missed and fell
the crack on the head helped for a moment
i tried to breathe got only smoke it was now or never the worlds outside were far from inviting but there was nothing for me in the shuttle but death by asphyxiation
i could drop into identity make hasty repairs study the data i had collected decide where i was and try again
back to hands and knees a grip on a board on my feet now reaching for the switch find it in the choking smoke pull there was a shock a sense of whirling then a blow that sent me flying against shattering boards into rubbery foliage and a gush of fresh air i finished coughing extricated myself from the bed of vines i found myself in half expecting to see them reach for me fortunately however the strange causeand effect sequences of eentropy didnot apply here that stream of pseudotime was as static in normal time as the ter was during a shuttle ride
in the gloom i made out the shape of the flimsy box that had brought me here canted against a giant treetrunk smashed into a heap of scrap lumber
smoke was boiling from under the heaped boards and bright flames showed starting along a wristthick vine casting flickering light and shadow on surrounding trees and underbrush
there was a board under my foot still trailing a festoon of wires i grabbed it up struggled through to the fire beat at the flames it was a mistake the bruised stems oozed an inflammable sap which caught with bright poppings and cracklings i was merely fanning the flames
the main chassis of the smashed shuttle was too heavy for me to try to drag back from the blaze
i tried to reach the coil with some vague idea of salvage but the fire was burning briskly now the dry wood flamed up sending fire high along the treetrunk igniting mere vines
five minutes later from a distance of a hundred yards i watched a firstclass forest fire getting underway
the rain started then too late to salvage anything from the shuttle but soon enough to save the forest
i found shelter of sorts under a wideleafed bush and sank into exhausted sleep
morning dawned grey wet chilly with water dripping from a billion leaves all around me
i crawled out checked over assorted bruises found everything more or less intact
i still had a slight rawness in the throat from the smoke and somewhere gotten a nice blister on the heel of my left hand but that seemed a modest toll for the trip i had had
the fire had burned out a ragged oval about a hundred feet across i walked across the black stubble to the remains of the shuttle surveyed the curled and charred boards the blackened lump that had been the coil
the last faint hope flickered and died i was stranded for good this time with no handy museum to help me out
there was a vague sensation in my central region that i recognized as hunger
i had a lot of thinking to do some vain regrets to entertain a full quota of gloomy reflections on what was happening now back in the imperial capital but first i had to have food and if my sketchy knowledge of jungles was any guide a shelter of some sort against other inhabitants of the region that might consider me to be in that category
and even before food i needed a weapon
a bow and arrow would be nice but it would take time to find a suitable wood and have to kill something for gut for the string
a spear or club was about all be able to man76 age in my present state of technological poverty
and even for those need some sort of cutting edge which brought me back to the stone age in two easy steps
well the best source for nice usefulsized stones would be a stream and while there i could get a drink not that there was not plenty of water dripping down my neck here
the shoes i wore stiff loafertype clodhoppers with buckles werenot the best for negotiating the uneven ground but after all my remote ancestors hadnot had that much
the ground had a slight slope to what i suspected was the east i pushed my way through the thick growth not as junglelike as what seen from the shuttle minutes before my crash landing but not a nice picniccy sort of new england wood either
i kept to the downslope stopping now and then to listen for gurgling streams or growling bears
the boy scout lore paid off i broke through into a swampy crescent hugging a grey mudflat with a meandering current at its center fifty feet distant
tightpacked greenery hung over the far side of the watercourse which curved away around a spit of more of the grey mud
there were no stones in sight
still there was plenty of clay good for pottery making perhaps i squatted dipped up a sample it was thin and sandy muck useless
there was ample room to walk beside the stream i followed the course for several hundred yards found a stretch of higher ground where the water came close to a bank of grassy soil
this would make as good a campsite as any
i pulled off my shoes eased over the edge into the water sluiced the worst of the soot and mud from myself and clothes
turning back i noticed a strata of clean yellowish clay in the bank
it was the real stuff smooth pliable almost greasy in texture
all i needed was a nice fire to harden it and over which to cook my roasts chops fish fillets et cetera as soon as i had acquired the latter using the weapons i would make as soon as i had an axe and a knife
i was almost sunset
the days efforts had netted me one lump of flint which i had succeeded in shattering into a handaxe and a couple of slicing edges that any decent flintworker would have tossed into the discard pile for archaeologists to quarrel over a few thousand years later
still they had sufficed to hack off two twelvefoot lengths of a tough springy sapling remove the twigs and leaves and sharpen the small ends to approximate points
i had also gathered a few handfuls of small blackberry like fruits which were now giving me severe stomach pains and several pounds of the pottery clay which i had shaped into crude bowls and set aside for air drying
the skies had cleared off in the afternoon and i had built a simple shelter of branches and large leaves and dragged in enough nearlydry grass for a bed of sorts
and using a strip of cloth torn from my shirt i had made a small firebow
with a supply of dry punk from the interior of a rotted tree and a more or less smooth stone with a suitable hollow i was now preparing to make fire
my hardwood stick was less hard than i would have liked and the bow was a clumsy makeshift but it was better than just sitting and thinking
i crumbled the wood powder in the hollow placed the pointed end of the stick against it with the bow string wrapped around it and started in
ten minutes later with the bow twice broken and mended the stick dulled and the punk and my temper both exhausted i gave it up for the night crawled into my cosy shelter
two minutes later a bellow like a charging elephant brought me bolt upright groping for a gun that wasnot there
i waited heard a heavy body crashing through underbrush nearby then the annoyed growl that went with the kind of appetite that preferred meat
there were a number of large trees in the vicinity i found one in the dark with amazing speed climbed it losing a trifling few square feet of skin in the process and wedged myself in a high crotch and listened to stealthy footsteps padding under my perch until dawn
i the tracks the next morning when i halfclimbed half fell from the tree
they were deeply imprinted too big to cover with my spread fingers not counting the claws on the prints that is
some kind of cat i guessed
down at the waters edge were more tracks big hoofmarks the size of saucers
they grew em big in these parts
all i had to do was bag one and have meat for as long as i could stand the smell
i was getting really hungry now following the stream i covered several miles to the south gradually working my way into more open country
there were plenty of signs of game including the bare bones of something not quite as big as a london bus with eondorlike birds picking over them halfheartedly
i had my two spears and my stone fragments and i was hoping to spot something appropriate to my resources say a halfgrown rabbit
there was a sudden rattle of wings just in front of me and a grousylooking bird as big as a turkey took to the air
i advanced cautiously found a nest with four eggs in it speckled brown three inches long
i squatted right there and ate one and enjoyed every scrap
it would have been nice to have scrambled it but that was a minor consideration
the other three i distributed in various pockets then went on feeling a little better now
the country here was higher with less underbrush and more normallooking trees in place of the swampy jungle growth started from
during highwater i imagined the whole area where the shuttle lay would be submerged
now i had a better view off through the open forest to what seemed like a prairie to the south where the game would be
another half hours walk brought me to the edge of a vast savannah that reminded me of pictures seen of africa with immense herds grazing under scattered thorn trees
here the trees were tall hardwoods growing in clumps along the banks of the stream and the animals were enough to make any zookeeper turn in his badge and start keeping white mice
i saw bison eight feet at the shoulder massive tusked almostelephants with bright pink trunks and pendulous lower lips deer in infinite variety and horses built like shortnecked giraffes ten feet high at the shoulder with sloping withers
there they were and all i had to do was to stick them with my spear
there was a low snort from somewhere behind me i whirled saw a head the size of a rhinos set with two rows of huge needlesharp teeth in a mouth that gaped to give me a view of a throat like the intake duct on a jet fighter
there was a body behind the head ten feet or more of massively muscled tawny blonde cat with a hint of mane faint stripes across the flanks snow white throat belly and feet
i took all these details in as the mighty carnivore looked me over yawned and paced majestically toward me frowning across at the distant herds like a troubled politician wondering who to pay the bribe to
he passed me up at a distance of thirty feet moved out into the area head high now looking over the menu
none of the animals stirred
king cat kept on bypassed a small group of mastodons who rolled their eyes switching their trunks nervously
he had his eye on the bison among whom were a number of cuddly calves weighing no more than a ton
they moved restlessly now forming up a defensive circle like the muskox of the arctic
the hunter varied his course angling to the left
maybe he was thinking better of it with the suddenness of thought he was running streaking across the grass in thirtyfoot bounds leaping now clear over the front rank of tossing horns to disappear as the herd exploded outward in all directions then he reappeared standing over the body of a calf one paw resting affectionately on the huddled tan corpse
the herd stampeded a short distance resumed feeding
i let out a long breath
that was a hunter i jumped at a sound spun my hand with my trusty spear coming up automatically a brown rabbit the size of a goat stood poised on wiry legs snuffling the air showing long yellow iatteeth
i brought the spear back threw saw it catch the creature in mid leap as he whirled to flee knocking him head over long white heels
i came pounding up swung the second spear like a farmers wife killing a snake laid him low
breathing hard i gingerly picked up the bloody carcass noting the gouge my spear had made looked around for a place to hide up and feast
something black moved on my arm
a flea
i diopped the rabbit captured the parasite cracked him with a satisfying report
there were plenty more where that one came from i saw stirring around in the sparse hair on the footlong ears
suddenly i didnot want raw rabbit or overgrown rat for lunch
as suddenly as that the adrenalin been getting by on for the past thirtysix hours drained away left me a hungry sick battered castaway stranded in a hellworld of raw savagery an unimaginable distance from a home which i knew never see again
i had been bumbling along from one fiasco to the next occupying my mind with the trivial unwilling to face reality the chilling fact that my life would end here in solitude and misery in pain and fear and that before many more hours had passed
i under a tree staring up at the sky resting i told myself or waiting for another cat less choosy to happen along
i had had my chances more than one and muffed them all gotten away clean in the hagroon shuttle then let it carry me helplessly along to their dencity permitted myself to be captured without a struggle thinking learn something from the gorilla men
and after a combination of the enemys stupidity and my luck had given me a new chance a new shuttle guessed wrong again let dzok beguile me along to be sentenced to life in exile
and a third time after my wild guesses had paid off i had panicked run from the enemy without waiting to test my homebuilt shuttle and ended here
each time i had made what seemed like the only possible choice and each time gotten farther from my starting point
not farther in terms of net distance perhaps but infinitely farther from any hope of rescue to say nothing of my hope of warning the imperial authorities of what was afoot
i got to my feet started back toward where left the wreckage of the shuttle with some halfformed idea of searching through the wreckage again for what i didnot know
it was the blind instinct of one who had absorbed all the disaster he can for a while and who substitutes aimless action for the agony of thought
it was harder now plodding back over the ground already covered
following the course of the river i passed the huge skeleton abandoned now by the birds reached the mudflat where the trampled remains of my crude hut gave a clear indication of the inadequacies of my choice of camsites
i had an idea of sorts then back at the shuttle there was a lump of metal the remains of the original maxoni coil
i might be able to use the material in some way pound it out into spearheads or make a flintandsteel for firestarting the impulse died
my stomach ached and i was tired
i wanted to go home now have a nice hot bath crawl into bed and be joined there by someone soft and perfumed and cuddly whod smooth my fevered brow and tell me what a hell of a guy i was
it was easy to see the mechanics of schizophrenia at work here
from wishing it was an easy jump to believing
i took a couple of deep breaths straightened my back and headed for the burnsite try to retain my grip on reality a little longer when it got unbearable i knew the sanctuary of insanity would be waiting here were animal tracks across the blackened ground hoofmarks paw prints and i bent over squinting to be sure human or near enough
i knew how robinson crusoe felt now the evidence of a fellow man gave me a sudden feeling of exposure along my backbone
i made it to the surrounding unburned wall of jungle in three jumps slid down flat on the ground and scanned the landscape
i tried to tell myself that this was a lucky break the first real hope fd had but an instinct older than theories of the brotherhood of man told me that i had encountered the worlds most deadly predator the fact that we might be of the same species just meant competition for the same hunting ground
my spear wasnot a handy weapon and my skill with it wasnot anything to strike a medal in prise of
i checked my pocket for one of my stones found a smashed egg
for a moment the ludicrousness of the situation threatened to start me snickering then i heard a sound from nearby in what direction i wasnot sure
i eased back rose up far enough to scan the woods behind me saw nothing
i tried to think the situation through
if i was right if it was a man whod visited here it was important to establish contact
even a primitive would have some sort of culture food fire garments of sorts shelter
i had skills pottery making basket weaving the principle of the bow
we could work out something perhaps but only if i could survive the first meeting
i heard the sound again saw a deerlike creature making its way across the burn
i let out a breath i didnot know been holding and relaxed
there was no way of knowing how long ago the manprints had been made
still i couldnot lie here forever
i emerged made a quick check of the burnedout shuttle
everything was as left it
i took another look at the footprints
they seemed to be made not by a bare foot but by a heelless sandal of some sort
they came across the bum circled the shuttle went away again and on the latter portion of the trail they clearly overlay my own booted prints
whoever my visitor had been he was following me or had started out on my trail
it was a thought that did nothing for my peace of mind
i tried to calm the instinct that told me to get as far from the spot as possible
i needed to meet this fellow and on terms that i could control
i didnot want to kill him but neither did i want to try the palm outward friend of longknife routine
that left capture
i was risky business working out in the open but then being alive was a risky business
if the man tracking me had followed my trail then lost it somewhere on the high ground it might be a matter of many hours before he came back here to cast about again and i was sure for some reason that hed do the latter
and when he did i had been working hard for two hours now setting up my snare
it wasnot fancy and if my proposed captive were any kind of woodsman which he had to be to survive here it wouldnot fool him for a moment
still it was action of a sort occupational therapy maybe but better than hiding under a bush and waiting and it was helpful to my morale to imagine that i was taking the initiative
the arrangement consisted of a shallow pit excavated in the soft soil covered over with a light framework of twigs and leaves and camouflaged with a scattering of blackened soil
i had done the digging with my bare hands helped out by a board from the wreck and the dirt had been heaped under the brush out of sight behind the wall of foliage
the hole was no more than four feet deep but that was sufficient for my purpose to throw the intruder offbalance give me the drop on him sufficiently to open negotiations a handy advantage
i was hungry enough now to scrape one of the smashed eggs from the lining of my pocket and eat it but first i had to select my hiding place and get ready to act when the victim stepped into the trap
i picked a spot off to the left arranged myself so as to be able to jump out at the psychological moment and settled down to wait
the pit was dug just in front of the wreckage at the point where the opening to the interior would lead an inqusitive victim i had dropped a lacyedged hanky just inside the opening as an added attraction
it was one olyvia had lent me to mop my forehead during the last allnight session and it still held a whiff of a perfume that would attract a primitive more surely than a scattering of gold coins
i had done all i could the next step was up to the opposition
i from a light doze to see that it was late evening
the trees were black lacework against a redgold sky and the chirruping of crickets and the shrill tseet tseet of a bird were the only sounds against an absolute stillness and then the crackle of underbrush the snap of broken twigs the sound of heavy breathing
i froze trying to see through the gloom
he was coming hell he was there and making no effort at stealth
he was sure of himself this native which probably meant that here in his own stamping giound he was top carnivore
i tried to picture the kind of man who could stand up to the king cat seen and gave it up as too discouraging
and this was the fellow i was going to trip up and then threaten with a broom handle i swallowed the old corn husks if youve recently changed your address or plan to in the near future be sure to notify us at once make the necessary changes on your mailing plate and see to it that your subscription continues without interruption

your account number appears directly above your name on the mailing label that had gotten wedged in my throat squinted some more made out a tall figure coming across the burned ground stooping apparently peering around looking for me no doubt
the thought gave me no comfort
i couldnot see what kind of weapon be had i gripped my spear tried to hold my breathing to a deep slow rhythm
he was close now pausing to glance over the shuttle then turning toward the entrance hold
the handkerchief would be visible in the dim light and the scent he took a step another he was close now a vague dark shape in deep shadow there was a choked yell a crashing a thud and i was out of my hideyhole stumbling across a tangle of roots bringing my spear up skidding to a halt before the pale torso and dark head of the man who struggled scrabbling for a handhold hipdeep in my trap
hold it right there
i barked through clenched teeth holding the spear ready with both hands poised over the man who stood frozen now a narrovishouldered longarmed figure his face a dark blob under a white headpiece say bayard dzoks voice came led me a merry chase i must say concluded next month by the senior citizens club has an anteroom beyond the red door
try not to go through was while the tacky white enameled android was putting the second scoop of beans on his breakfast tray that penrose began to wonder if he was really old
penrose put one hand flat on his face feeling for wrinkles
the serving android flipped another scoop of beans out of the cauldron set in its chest
this one missed the tray and dropped on to the tan blanket of bed
the android ticked and more beans fell on the cot
the old man in the next bed stretched a foot out from under the covers and kicked the andy
the machine ratcheted and whirred then said good morning
have a happy day
it rolled away to serve the fat man across the aisle
harrison said the old man who had booted the android
he was lanky weathered
his face had deep sharp wrinkles
he turned slightly in the bunk and penrose saw that he had only one arm
penrose hesitated
penrose he said anally
excuse me fuzzy about things
he couldnot remember even yesterday he realized now
harrison swallowed a spoonful of orange beans
you know where you are donot you their room was small metallic with a low grey ceiling
there were six beds in it
only five of them occupied
at the far end was a red metal door guess said penrose not certain
where do you think
penrose looked down at his tray
the two scoops of beans had collapsed into a single pool
well this is greater los angeles
and the date is its october yes i know that the 16th corrected harrison
nodding penrose said oh thats right missing a day in senior citizens terminal said harrison
the men in the other beds were old too like harrison
penrose touched his face again not quite sure why here been having trouble remembering exactly
i have a feeling not not a senior citizen
neither am called the fat old man across the aisle
he was pink and grey
carlisle said harrison
he has memory trouble too know you harrison said carlisle a mean old coot old enough to be my grandfather
you maybe are my grandfather
he was a mean old onearmed man too
except it was his right arm he was lacking
the serving android was making harsh scraping sounds now
it had stopped by the bed of a small quiet old man
the man was flat on his back not moving breathing softly through hie mouth
his hair was long and fine and his skin was a transparent bluewhite
good morning
have a happy day said the android propping the old man up and spoon feeding him from the cauldron
guttenberg said harrison eighty bet he doesnot know who he is either said carlisle watched harrison finish breakfast
is everyone sick here
no said harrison
you must know all about the senior citizens terminals
think about it
penrose leaned back against the metal head rest
the senior citizens terminals he said are under the jurisdiction of the united states welfare squad
and are free to all
the problem of the aged is at a stage of solution never before known
nearly one hundred old timers are collected each month in each terminal
because of the welfare squad these old folks can live out their golden days without fear of burdening their friends and relations
now that he thought about it penrose realized he knew a lot about the terminals
but he didnot know why he was here doing excellently said old harrison
do you recall the recruiting part of this set up
stop now said carlisle trying to recollect who i really am and your talk is unsettling to me
carlisle said harrison retired data processor
no not said the heavy old man a spry young fellow with a name that starts with about recruiting harrison said to penrose
penrose concentrated
it is the function of the welfare squad to recruit at least a minimum quota of old folks each collection period
those old timers who are not reclaimed in days are then processed at no extra cost
quit called out carlisle donot want to hear about that been here days said harrison
the fifth man in the room stood up on top of his cot
he was small with straightstanding white hair and black pockets under his pale eyes
there are things of which i may not speak there are dreams that cannot die there are thoughts that make the strong heart weak
and bring a pallor to the cheek
and a mist before the eye he said
remmeroy said harrison
he gets processed next week bed was suddenly pulled out from under him and slid back into the grey metal wall
the old man thunked to the floor
harrison swung out of his cot just as it shot away and he caught penrose up and out of his
we arise abruptly in this place
the serving android opened a panel in the wall and buzzed out of the room
have a happy day he big blond recreational android joggled penrose by the shoulder
no wool gathering fowler
this is letter writing time
penrose had almost remembered something important not fowler he said
the second joggle was harsher
letter writing time pops
sorry he said
he picked up the speaker tube of the lap letteriter
the andy moved on and penrose dictated to whom it may concern
i still donot know what doing here
i am confused and depressed
the letteriter jumped out of his lap and began bouncing on the floor making a bleeting sound
negative negative
the blond andy was at his shoulder again
fowler youre not doing so good today guess not
you guess
cramps you know not
now i want you to speak a nice pleasant letter
get me
yes sir
the letteriter crawled up his left leg and settled into his lap nudging him sharply in the groin not sure said penrose who it is writing to
the therapy said the blond android is in the act and is not involved with the recipient at all
hello everybody dictated penrose having a great time here
he felt the androids grip lessen having a happy day
the hand was lifted away but penrose kept saying cheerful things
carlisle was having trouble trying to communicate with my girl friend he told the rec andy
her name begins with an or an just say youre fond of her answered the android am i am said carlisle canot start off the letter with dear or you see
start
sweetheart said carlisle into his tube
remmeroy used his letteriter standing up
he was hunched in a corner with it under his arm
when the lamp is shattered the light in the dust lies dead when the cloud is scattered
the rainbows glory is shed
when the lute is broken
sweet tunes are remembered not right said the passing android keep it cheerful
guttenberg his hands limp at his sides was propped in a chair
come on gramps said the android
talk
send off something friendly to your loved ones
penrose turned to harrison who was sitting next to him his letter writing done
why donot they leave guttenberg alone
he canot even speak can he
no said harrison
it doesnot make sense
not efficient is it
penrose hesitated
the welfare squad has an able and qualified staff of checkers the efficiency detail
it is their duty to make a thorough inspection periodically of each and every senior citizens terminal
yes thats true said harrison
of course said penrose fellows in the efficiency detail are overworked and underpaid
sometimes they canot be as thorough as theyd like to be
the recreational andy held the speaker up near mouth ten word message pops
you can do that much
come on we stop him
penrose asked
he turns off automatically when the recreation period ends
guttenberg is able to hold out till then
this happens every day
harrison nodded
therapy time announced a voice from the wall
the blond android let go of guttenberg he therapist was shaped like a portable safe and had a gun metal finish
now said penrose when it was his turn this is going to sound odd to you
not at all mr fowler said the metal box in a warm voice
penrose fidgeted on the armchair that had come up through the fioor
first off not fowler
penrose
now heres the situation as i see it
let me by the way apologize for being vague in some of the details
i realize now that probably been given some kind of medication
look he said up the sleeve of his tan shirt you canot help but see the needle marks several of them
and some in my backside too
while i appreciate the smooth efficient way i was given medical aid i have to say disturbed that i havenot snapped out of it better
yes of course mr fowler said the therapist
no not fowler skip that for a minute
i think i had some sort of accident or something and was taken maybe to the nearest hospital
fine
however there seems to be a mistake being made not this fowler in fact you can see that not even old not a senior citizen hardly eflficient is it
to keep me on here
certainly certainly
when i woke up this morning i was much fuzzier than i am now
things are starting to fill in for me certain about thirty four years old
there must be though i canot remember it as yet some useful function i fill on the outside
some part of the essential function of greater los angeles surely possible answered the therapist
all you have to do is let them know at central control and be able to take off
you must have my outside clothes and packet and money someplace
you realize that in a terminal of this size we can not be responsible for loss of property said the machine
theft of belongings is naturally lamentable
the responsibility can not be assumed however by the terminal staff
no said penrose not grousing about my belongings go back to the fact that only thirty four years old
i donot belong here
to be sure
then youll do something
you can assume that your problem will be given all the attention it warrants said the therapist must be getting on to my next patient
when exactly will you let me know
penrose asked as the machine started to roll toward chair
yes yes it said and began talking to carlisle
penrose glanced hopefully at harrison and the one armed man smiled back
a fter lunch came sitting
not in the soft chairs that had appeared for therapy but in stiff straight metal ones
penrose had his hands capping his knees
essentially he said to harrison the terminals are a positive thing
a solution to the problem of senior clutter the welfare squad point of view hand rested on his chest
those old timers who donot function anymore in the highly overstocked urban and suburban complex are weeded out said penrose
should it turn out that an individual senior citizen still has a valid function he can always be reclaimed
they say the actual termination is pleasant
looking at the red door penrose said right beyond there isnot it
yes
this is one of the waiting rooms
you can spend from a day to a week or more here
depends on processing
after a moment penrose said should be back home by late today
you know about yourself
penrose shook his head
not entirely aware that only thirty four in this terminal by mistake
all the details on myself havenot come back to ine as yet
still said harrison you wonder
wonder about what
if this terminal has made a mistake
perhaps others do too
perhaps this one has before
no said penrose why they have the efficiency detail
they slipped up in your case
there was a brief confusion because guttenberg fell over sideways out of his chair
carlisle and remmeroy righted him system like this has to have a human element said penrose
even though the terminal itself is fully automatic
the efficiency detail provides that human element why i know the error in my case will be cleared up
suppose said harrison
remmeroy hopped up on his chair remember i remember the house where i was born
the little window where the sun came peeping in at morn
suppose what asked penrose
harrison shrugged his armless shoulder
that an efficiency detail man came here to terminal to inspect
they work solo you know
the budget doesnot allow for teams
possibly the last time the efficiency detail man was through he oveilooked a faulty rail on a ramp
this time as he leaned on it he fell and whacked his head
while he was unconscious before the automatic staff rushed to help someone might have switched papers with him
someone named fowler say
by the time the staff gave him treatment for his fall and shots this efficiency detail man would be pretty confused
the equipment here a lot of it anyway is old and erratic and they might easily get him mixed up with one of these old fellows
one on his way to a termination waiting room
oh thats very unlikely said penrose was a rich fuel speculator said carlisle
before i got mixed up with this wild bunch here
youngest fellow in my profession
how about you he called out to penrose canot he said quite remember
does it start with a the chairs retracted and it was time for naps the wall told them
harrison frowned
penrose was with the efficiency detail
penrose was put to sleep before he could say anything to harrison he serving android was backed into a corner
on the blink again said carlisle
for dinner a table had appeared
the five men were arranged around it give it a kick said harrison
penrose jumped up and got to the android first
would you please get hold of the therapist for me
happy day said the machine
look said penrose
that harrison trying to tell me somehow been mistaken for an old man named fowler
that its this turn to be terminated today
that kind of mistake is not going to look good on the records
he touched one sticky arm of the enameled android donot know harrison could be lying
he says with the efficiency detail
the drugs you people gave me still fuzzy
will you tell the therapist to please god hurry
in case it is true
choice of desert the andy said
remmeroy ran around the table and came slowly toward penrose and the android
the sea is calm tonight
the tide is full the moon lies fair
the old man slammed his fist against the machine and broke his hand
penrose exhaled sharply
somebody would have to come now and look after remmeroy
then hed be able to get word out
if he were with the efficiency detail they wouldnot be missing him yet
he only had to report in once a week
he covered a good part of greater los angeles and didnot have to file anything until the end of each work week
still the efficiency detail might be wondering about him already been here two days now apparently
he didnot recall a family
civil servants didnot have time for close ties usually
remmeroy returned to the table
his good hand locked around his other wrist
he howled once and spun
then sat quietly in his chair
nothing came to help him
the night nurse has some loose valves said harrison
may not eome at all tonight was the youngest real doctor in my home town said carlisle
my hometown began with a or an penrose cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled
the red door swung open and the lights in the grey room dimmed
sorry said harrison turning away
nice to have met you said carlisle
two bright silver androids rolled out of the room beyond the red door
they slid over the floor and took hold of penrose
this is going to mean trouble said penrose
something jabbed his arm
now now said one of the androids
it had the same voice as the therapist
things are okay
perfectly added the other
they took him into the termination room and guided him into its one straight chair
the chair once his weight hit it extended restraining straps around him
penrose was not as clear as he had been
be sure my message gets through he said
the androids were gone and the door closed
there was a wet sound now
a waterfall it sounded like
and soft organ music began to fill the room
penrose tried to remember
he couldnot quite believe that harrison was right
that he was with the welfare squad with the efficiency detail
it didnot seem to him that he could have been a part of a set up like this
not at all
a silver tube slid up out of the floor then another
a gas with a faint floral odor was being released
penrose drifted back in the chair
the room was doing a smooth job of termination
very efficient said penrose
by the civil war exerted a strange influence on fantasy writers
ambrose bierce uncovered a strange occurrence at owl creek bridge
now john jakes discovers one equally strange at another bridge and at the graves across it
i those grim days men became much less than men and only something more than animals
this was because we had only the most primitive of objectives to eat when we could to sleep if we might to slaughter pillage burn as much as we had strength and endurance to do
we rode and marched by day and by night
we lived in a daze of dirt screams fatigue disease death
on every night horizon red stains seemed to signal that the whole state of georgia was afire
rumors ran that the general who was called gump behind his back after his middle name tecumseh intended to bring the reb government to its knees by devastating the land
on the road some days after atlanta fatigue and illness caught up with me
i blanked out for short periods of time as i rode though i managed to remain with my unit
then a more violent spell of fever seized me
i fell out of column to rest
the upshot was i woke the next dawn to discover i had been left behind
although i rode half the next night to find the 10th new york house i failed
i was lost
i was alone in a rural land full of trees and cabins where the johnny rebs might look out at me and snipe me from the saddle
after i realized i was lost i rode for another day and part of the next night still without success
i was armed my pistol my saber and what they called a texas toothpick a big wicked fighting knife which a sergeant had swapped me and which i had put away in my boot
i had no food
after a period of fever from which i remember nothing i suddenly found myself on a cor93 duroy road at the entrance to a dark avenue between gigantic water oaks
i weaved in the saddle
the stars blurred then sharpened
otherwise the sky was black
the land smelled of dampness and the smoke of pillage
but i was so far out into the back country i saw no signs of fires burning
at the head of the avenue a white glimmering revealed a plantation house
i nudged my weary horse toward it for i thought fd seen a lantern gleam
half way up the avenue between the rustling trees my horses hoofs rattled suddenly on boards
we were crossing a flat bridge unseen in the dark
it spanned a bubbling creek
my horses left forehoof came down on rotted board
planks creaked snapped
the whole decayed center of the bridge gave way beneath us
i fell twisting free of the screaming frantic animal
i struck the water
it was not deep but my head cracked a rock
a fresh lance of pain added to that already racking my bones he chill creek water plucked at my elbows
i saw my horse scramble up and blow noisily unhurt in the fall
if she wandered off i would have no way to catch up to my unit
i tried to rise
i fell back and all went dark
when i opened my eyes again the aching and chill had grown worse
my teeth rattled
judging by the silence of the birds and the slight pall in the sky the time was near false dawn
i dragged myself upright and clambered up the creek bank
a whinny near one of the water oaks showed that my horse had not wandered off
i lurched toward her through a clammy ground mist which swirled and eddied around my boots
this mistiness hid the great house at the head of the avenue except where a solitary yellow square seemed to glisten as though a lamp were lit i walked toward my horse reached out to stroke her muzzle
suddenly the back of my neck crawled
a man peered at me from the mist a scarecrowthin figure in sodden clothes so befouled with dirt it was impossible to recognize what sort they were
his face was stubbled
his mouth hung open in a kind of wrenched grin
his eyes were without pupils white as milk
give me a hand i said
where can i find some food and abed the apparition let out a low sound like a moan
the mist drifted higher
i thought the figure had turned and fled
i stumbled after it
wait
come back here a union officer i order you to the words floated eerily in the mist
there was no one there
through my fever i realized that the spectre of the pastyfaced man must be an hallucination the result of weeks of weariness hunger illness of seeing dead men left behind at the roadside while cump juggernaut moved across georgia
but i did need help
so i cupped my hands to my mouth and began to shout
in the echoing silence after my shout i heard a door creak and slam
the exertion of calling for help began a new racking pain in my chest
my boot slipped in a moistureslimed rock along the creeks bank
i caught a clump of shrub for balance
but i tumbled over sprawling in the water again
a sibilant whisper of wind drifted between the water oaks on the avenue
somehow as i crouched on hands and knees in the bubbling creek i knew that a person was coming toward me along that avenue
i swung my head
the mere exertion started my forehead buzzing and thudding again
i felt that i might blank out
as i made an effort to scrabble toward the bank my left hand brushed against my holster
it was empty
had my pistol dropped out into the water
i tried to peer under the surface of the black swirling stuff
i did not see the weapon
then as fresh waves of dizziness washed over me two sensations struck me almost together one visual the other aural
the first was the sight of wavering orange firedots burning through the mist at the tips of a manybranched candlestick
someone was carrying the candlestick down the avenue through the mist
the noise far out on the road was the unmistakable clatter of hoofs and wheels
i turned toward it
a caisson whipped by rumbling
a squad of cavalrymen in blue rode behind
they wore blue uniforms
i was not totally cut off from cump army after all i reared up in the water to shout
the cry never left my mouth
i felt new rushes of dizziness felt my hands slipping beneath me
my face plunged back in the water an instant after i had a macabre impression of a beautiful young woman the manybranched candlestick held in her pale right hand gazing at me through the mist from the creek bank
the candlelights danced and went out i with a thick feverish feeling in my head and a smell of dust in my nostrils
i was staring into the burning candlestick set upon a low table
beyond it where darkness clotted in the corner of what once must have been a genteel parlor a fat spider crawled lazily up a cobwebbing near the ceiling
these impressions and others filtered through a haze of fever made me uneasy
so did the great grotesque shadows thrown by the sheeted furnishings and the thick patina of dirt upon the windows
in the sky outside i saw the last brooding smear of a sunset indicating that i had been unconscious most of the day
my hands rested on the arms of a highbacked chair
my booted feet were propped on a low stool in front of me
i became conscious of both my pistol and saber being missing
just then the sabers blade flashed across my vision and hung there like a glittering metal bar
i turned my head thought youd never come round yank
her voice was musical but edged with mockery
the winevelvet gown she wore had seen more prosperous days like the house and the land
but her body was young and firm and her chin was tilted up
she had a pretty mouth sharp gray eyes and a long shinygold tress of hair tied at the nape of her neck with common string
to see a southern girl in such a state of disarray holding a cav96 airy saber at my throat to boot would have been an unnerving sight even for a man not plagued by fever
how did i get here
walked
i helped you some donot remember
you going to make a fuss she said
no i said guess you could put that through my gullet if i did
she nodded almost primly
yes take much
this your place i asked
twelveoaks belonged to my husband donot know where i am exactly i said eyeing that shining strip of iron in her hand a hand which did not shake by a fraction think i picked up some kind of fever and i got separated from my unit
she continued to watch me steadily
do you have a name
coburn i said
captain joshua coburn 10th new york horse
riding with that devil sherman she said though i nodded
does that earn me the saber through the neck
slowly she raised the blade examined its shining surface
then with a shrug she laid it on one of the sheetdraped pieces of furniture
it should right enough cept i havenot quite turned to acting like an animal even though the yankees whove been riding through this part of the country have set a fine example
my name is miranda saxby
she walked a step closer displayed a gold ring on her left hand
mrs saxby
or the widow saxby you could say
i make clear that all that happened between us happened as though i saw heard took part in it while staring through layers of gauze
i was lightheaded inclined to talk foolishly because of the fever and unable to summon up much energy to stir from the highbacked chair even though the sternness of her gaze warned me that because i was a union officer alone and sick she knew she enjoyed an advantage not many of her had enjoyed of late a chance for revenge
as if to reinforce this idea she turned and walked off a ways
she paused by another table where several dusty goblets and a cut glass decanter full of some berry wine had been laid out good reason to hate your kind
captain donot think i have not she said back turned
the term widow had struck home a moment before
your husband maam
yes
her skirts rustled as she swung
shiloh church
he was one of the first to die
the slaves have all run off thanks to that monster who runs your guvmint
down here we call him linkum the ape
she laughed a sound like bells
but there was little humor in her eyes as she continued we heard general sherman was marching in this district
most of the owners pulled out but i stayed
i didnot have a place in the world to go
i came from the sort of place where well it was in new orleans captain
some try to prettify the type of place by calling it a boarding school for young ladies
i saw men killed there
gamblers riffraff
she nodded at the saber
so not exactly unfamiliar with how its done
chill sweat began to bead up on the plams of my hands and upon my face as well
she unstoppered the decanter
she poured out two goblets of the wine sipped a bit of hers then carried the other to me
cherry wine she said
might warm you could use some food if theres any i said
for a damnyank youre mighty highhanded in your wants
for the first and only time during the encounter i laughed aloud
it came out as more of a dry croak youve got no reason to like union soldiers as you say and probably plenty of reason for disliking them
so i figure youll either make things easy for me or kill me with no inbetween
miranda smiled a fact
so which is it
food or the sword through my neck there a foot or so in front of me the wine goblet catching the lights of the candlestick and reflecting them in odd little sparkles in her eyes she grew tense
she extended the goblet yet did not offer it fully
a door creaked somewhere
i had a wild foolish pang of fright
i wished just then for no clear reason that the clattering caisson seen on the corduroy road had wheeled in
it is not right to say i felt afraid of the reb widow yet i did
consider it this way
i was not afraid of what i saw namely a beautiful hungry defeated woman who had me at her mercy because i was feverish and weak i was afraid of something about her i could not see but only sensed plenty of reason for me to hate yankees she repeated softly sure there is pretend you hate all this burnin and killin
relive whatever you want but i donot enjoy it
three of them a sergeant and two corporals they rode in here a week ago ours
what else
what did you give them
i asked
wine or the sword spoken rashly trying to humor her
the wine goblet glittered a she threw it against my face with great violence
the impact of the glass didnot matter much
but the droplets running down through my beard had a nauseatingly sweet stink and seemed to sting and burn
i rubbed them away and the back of my hand seemed to sting for a time afterward too
they used me miranda said in a whisper
they hurt and used me
silent i watched her
i wondered why she was taking on so
the word for it in new orleans she said low is rape
again i was unsure about the proper reaction
certainly an inmate of a boarding school for young ladies could not have been all that repelled by such an act
it must have been the fact that she and they were partisans of different causes that produced all the pentup hate i heard seething in her voice
in any case her quicklyformed fists decided me against commenting on that aspect of it
there are scum in all armies i said
in any army there are scum
she appeared to compose herself a little
she shook off a light shudder and retrieved the goblet which somehow had not broken when it fell to the floor
as she poured more wine she said over her shoulder bound to be the way you yanks will explain it
well there have been enough others stopping by since
i was still wondering about that odd remark she brought me the glass
here ride out as soon as able i told her
frankly captain you donot look very damn able
she almost smiled again
and somehow in the merry cast of her mouth i thought i saw one of those little miracles which give the lie to the warmongers who say the rebs are monsters to a man or that we are for that matter by some of scavengers she was still human enough not to kill me outright
i had some dim pretentious hope or other that after the bloody conflict was done people like miranda saxby people even like myself might bind up the wounds
i sipped some of the wine
she did also
then i said yes worn out
i could enjoy a nights rest
butcher sherman miss one of his officers been gone a night already
one more hardly matters
well she said thoughtfully can give you a bed
but first some food
wait
she vanished through a curtain
the house creaked in silence
outside full dark had fallen
an owl hooted in the distance
a whisper of chill air brushed against my cheek
i swung my head
i felt rather than saw someone at the edge of the parlor there in the dark
i knew i must pull myself up out of the chair
i did staggering
the saber lay a great distance away
almost against my own will i looked around
the same ghastly whiteeyed creature i had glimpsed down by the creek stood in the wide doorway which led from the hall
behind him other hideous figures stirred unseen except for glimmers of empty white eyes
the right shoulder of the bescummed pale white apparition in the doorway displayed a tattering of dirty gold
what was it
i pounded my brains but they were too thick with fever for me to quite grasp at the answer i wanted
but i was filled with a terror beyond anything i had ever experienced
the thing there in the parlors entrance had bloated pastewhite cheeks
down those cheeks ran crooked blackish lines which some inward sense told me were tracks of blood long dried
the figure lifted its grimed hands as though reaching for me
it made a sound with its yellowtoothed mouth a sound which could only be transcribed as a guttural groan something like the other horrors behind it three or four of them it was impossible to tell took up the plaint until the ghastly moaning though not excessively loud seemed to press on my ears with actual pain
a i stared the mewlings of the things standing there intensified
i almost had a feeling that rather than menace they represented some kind of warning
the spectre nearest me ieached out toward me and all reason slipped away
with a terrified curse i blundered after the saber picked it up whirled around and drove it as hard as i could straight into the befouled jacket of the creature approaching
candlelight seemed to flare up white
i felt an impact through the blade
blinded i reeled away a step
when the dazzle faded i saw my saber impaled in the woodwork of the great door vibrating faintly
it had passed through nothing at all
the apparitions were gone
cold sweat rivered down my cheeks as i dug my knuckles into my eyes and strove to keep from falling
was i mad
was i so sick that i saw phantoms i started back to the highbacked chair accidentally knocking against the table bearing the decanter
as i made a vain effort to prevent it the decanter tipped crashed to the floor
the stopper flew out
the cherry wine leaked onto the pegged planking
i watched a tiny wisp of smoke curl up then another
the wine seeped down through the cracks between the planking leaving a wide ugly scar upon the wood
did you see something yankee
her muted voice spun me around
she watched from the curtain where she had appeared suddenly and silently
she carried a small tray on which rested a butt of gray moldtinged bread
i swallowed the bile taste of fear and said not certain
there was a man several men so it looked like
fever dreams she asked amused
they were too real for that
one had a patch of gold at his shoulder golden hair gleamed when she nodded
she set the tray aside as if it were no longer necessary as if pretense were at an end
her gray eyes pierced mine
yes captain coburn he was a full colonel
then i knew his uniform all fouled with filth
it was a blue uniform right captan
he was a yank
since a week ago since those first three men came by late one night the softness in her face vanished to be replaced by an angular blinding fury as her voice dropped and came buzzing through the fever since then others have stopped hunting food or rest or an available woman for their brute appetites
four of them have come
captain two together two separately
and i served them each a bit of wine
here come to the window
your bed is ready
i half way across that shadowthick chamber before the awful pain began to twist my belly
i doubled over tumbling across the highbacked chair
cramped in that awkward position i saw her lift a moldering yellow curtain
outside near the window of the plantation house moonlight gleamed on a patch of black dewslimed sward
four small piles of rocks glistened each at the head of a hump of earth
yawning beside the mound on the right was a fifth freshlydug open grave
somehow i got my hand down to my boot where the hideout knife was stashed
i drew it though it felt leadheavy
miranda saxby laughed and let the curtain fall do a bit of good on me
captain the same as it didnot on them when they came in a while ago god help me somehow i knew she was right
the motions she made were all the more evil because she attempted to mock the provocative as she turned her back toward me while her hands worked at the sash of her gown want you to rest well in your bed
captain
i want you to be warm and comfortable in your bed so thats why i mean to come into your bed to warm it
at least for a while anyway till you settle in for a long rest fret it wonot be so bad
abruptly she dropped her gown so that as she stood with her back toward me she was bare to the waist except for where the soft skin was hidden by the gold banner of her hair hanging down
over her shoulder she looked at me with the eyes of hell itself
most men even yankees think fm pretty
captain you the flesh of her back showed three round crusted black bullet holes
for what i did then there can be no apology no moral justification save that i knew i faced evil beyond comprehension
i lurched forward and stabbed the knife into her back up to the hilt
no blood appeared not a droplet not a stain
over her shoulder like some ghastly coquette miranda saxby looked at me with the toothpick sticking from between her shoulder blades just above the bullet wounds and she laughed merrily
if not exactly a brave man i had never fled from weapons fired in anger
but i fled then summoning the last vestiges of my feversapped strength
i turned and fled with a cry past the table with the candlestick which i knocked over
i staggered through the haunted hallway beating on the outer door until i sprung it open
i stumbled from the porch smashed my jaw in the dirt as i fell but somehow managed to get up and continue running down the avenue between the water oaks
my stomach wrenched and i was sick my system ridding itself of the poison by violent spasms
at last i stumbled again and sprawled out wondering if the wine would still kill me or only drug me wondering wondering if i would die this night
the ground on which i fell crawled with eerie radiance
lying in the avenue i twisted over
the candlestick had fired the place
flames leaped behind the duskthick windows
i heard a single awful piercing shriek
then my mind received the blackness again with a full welcome
a corporal from ohio scavenging the neighborhood for provisions in company with a small tuftwhiskered turncoat georgian named hanno discovered me
i learned later that they had been loading grain into a wagon at a cabin roughly a mile up the corduroy road when the flames in the sky drew their notice
i wakened with my back propped against one of the water oaks as dawn was breaking
the few timbers of twelveoaks still standing were black smoking fingers poked upward to a leaden sky
it had burned to the foundations
shaken uncertain of what i had seen or experienced the night before i said little to my rescuers at first drinking from a canteen and gnawing on a hunk of jerky until the ohio cor102 poral pressed me for details
i laid aside the canteen still feeling feverish
there was a fierce ache in my belly
but i felt a peculiar certainty that i would recover because what had transpired in that house last might was worse than any illness ever conceived by man save perhaps war
i carefully falsified a story in a cracked voice rode into this avenue late last evening
when that bridge yonder gave in beneath me i think i crawled to the creek bank
you was alyin right in the middle of the avenue when we come on you sir said the corporal
then i must have crawled there
i was in a daze i donot remember
except this much i had to ask the man hanno being a resident of the neighborhood
i thought that once a woman looked out of the window of that house
a young yellowhaired woman
perhaps the owners wife
i canot explain how the fire started but did you see anything of the woman this morning
hanno tugged at his whiskertufts
just dreams sir
what
mrs saxby bless her soul she was killed last week
now not criticizing you yankees sir
no sir youve treated me mighty fine mighty fine indeed
the ohio corporal snorted in contempt turning his head as hanno went on but some elements in the soldiery well it was three enlisted men air
union enlisted men i regret to say
they reined in at twelveoaks late one night asking for provender
i gather they took a shine to mrs saxby because well sir one of the slaves lived long enough afterward to tell the tale
first the union enlisted men ah forced their wills upon mrs saxby a poor widow lady
then because theyd been drinking these particular soldiers well they lined mrs saxby and the four slaves still faithful an staying with her up against a wall of the house and shot them all in the back
then they rode about the neighborhood boasting of it until they moved on
some of us citizens in the district we buried them all
yes all five a week ago
so the crux of it then became who occupied those graves

a little boy began to cry because his mother looked worried and a young man and his younger wife squeezed each others hand
the tourist section of the plane where they all sat was crowded but quiet

when the stewardesses did not move or fasten smiles on their lacquered faces the passengers began to look at each other and then to talk
there were twentyone people in firstclass and fiftyeight in tourist and their voices became suddenly loud as the engine noises faded
the fat priest had swallowed his grapes unbuckled his safety belt and stepped out into the aisle
this is not comical he said this is foul blasphemy and a cruel joke
a grayhaired lady with bright blue eyes pulled at his black sleeve
oh father what glory we are being transported gathered into his arms as it were
as it were as it were muttered the priest sitting dovn heavily on the metal buckle
up front the man with the moustache tapped max on the shoulder
will it go hard
max you think itll be bad
relax charlie you can never tell about these things
max ran his thick fingers up arm but the blonde was repairing her mascara rows ahead a portly man in a blue suit was slipping a soft hand inside his shirt and under his left breast and breathing hard
his wife a thin woman with the face of a headache said think about all those sunday mornings you played golf harry
the young couple in tourist understood now and smiled at each other glad we waited darling arenot you glad we waited it was worth waiting for he said not what i meant darling i mean we did everything right and now the grayhaired lady started to chant bless me
father for but everyone around her began to call to the priest and pluck at his sleeve
he lurched into the aisle again spitting grape seeds and ran to the lavatory
it was occupied
mommy whimpered the little boy and his mother smiled and caressed his hand be with daddy soon youll be with suddenly the engines cut off completely and the plane began to climb
soon soon cried the grayhaired lady in tourist almost orgiastically and the young couple smiled and kissed the air near each others cheeks and the mother held her son tightly and three young women near the galley crossed themselves and the priest was on his knees his head against the locked lavatory door
there was great quiet in first class
the portly man had slumped against the window and max folded fifty dollars into hand
we might get separated baby
the plane landed and the intercom crackled again
typewriters pumpernickels sabertooth tigers solidified musical notes beef stew all were grist to his mill
or should we say garbage to the temporal i by i a team of french archaeologists broke through the wall of an abandoned mine and found themselves in a veritable treasurehouse of prehistoric remains paintings of reindeer buffalo and wild horses covered the walls
a crude stone fireplace in the center of the cave contained bits of charred wood
nearby was a human skeleton every bone whole and undamaged
tools weapons and domestic utensils were neatly arranged along one wall a silent testimonial to paleolithic standards of housekeeping
among these objects was a heavy black ball which upon close inspection revealed the inscription subsequent laboratoiy tests showed the ball to be at least onehundred thousand years old
a knight in armor out for adventure in the english countryside was knocked from his horse by a typewriter
it came flying through the air from no place struck him a glancing blow on the head and disappeared
his helmet saved him from serious injury
an egyptian princess dallying in her scented bath looked up to find a fully dressed man sitting in the tub with her
she shrieked shot out of the water like a porpoise and bolted from the room
the man sat in the water his thick eyebrows locked in fury a cigar butt clamped between his teeth
dammit he muttered and dematerialized
a charge of fraud was brought against a distinguished dealer in antiques
visitors to his gallery inadvertently stumbled upon a wooden crate full of antiques that looked suspiciously new
one of the items a primitive electric handiron bore the trademark of westing howes a famous appliance manufacturing concern that flourished in ancient times
obviously a fake the article had apparently just been made and was now awaiting the clever touch of an unscrupulous expert to give it the appearance of a geniune antique
a roman emperor feeling himself being anointed a little ahead of schedule during coronation looked up and discovered a battered filthy can of motor oil precariously balanced in the rafters above
a son was born to george and mary klobbet
to the utter amazement of the attending doctors and nurses the child arrived with his eyes wide open and an enigmatic smile on his face his little fingers twisting the umbilical cord into the word hello
in a burst of inspiration the parents named him merlin
a large hungry pterosaur cruising at five hundred feet along the coast caught the glitter of sunlight reflecting from the scales of a school of fish in the water below
he wheeled gracefully poised for a moment perfectly balanced his wingtip resting precisely on a point of air then shot straight down legs and wings swept back along his body
he was plunged ing like a javelin when suddenly seventyfive feet above the waves a stale loaf of pumpernickel appeared in his path
with a squawk he threw out his wings in a frantic attempt to brake but it was no use he was moving too fast and a splitsecond later the cannonball shape was firmly impaled on his long pointed snout
the body came to a dead stop in midair crumpled like an accordion then pumpernickel and pterosaur together windmilled into the sea
the splash scattered the school of fish but they streaked back in an instant
two minutes later the pterosaurs immaculate skeleton came to a gentle rest on the bottom
the oumpernickel still affixed to the snout had survived the attack without a scratch but several dazed fish still swam limpingly in the vicinity trailing wisps of blood from their torn mouths and broken teeth
the scientific world is agog at the incredible invention of a new york boy by the name of merlin klobbet
the boy obviously a genius took an ordinary box camera made some obscure adjustments and produced what he calls an aremac
this device is a sort of camera in reverse
the operator clicks the shutter in the usual way but the picture instead of forming inside the contrivance as it does in a camera ma108 terializes on the surface of the subject itself
if the subject is a person he simply steps back out of his picture which is a full color replica of the exposed side and thats that
the picture remains standing there
there are however several disturbing features to these photostatues
first of all they obtain their color directly from the subject lifting off every bit of pigmentation in skin hair eyes clothes like dekals
the unfortunate subject is left completely bleached on the side that was exposed
the condition is thought to be permanent
the second disturbing feature is that these photostatues are indestructible despite their millionth of an inch thickness more they are firmly welded to whatever they happen to be standing on
a photostatue taken of someone standing on the sidewalk could be removed only be digging up the cement and carting away statue and sidewalk together
there are many additional reasons why i am impounding this aremac contraption the police commissioner stated in an interview but i wonot go into them now except to ask you to imagine what would happen if just one lousy busload of tourists got loose in this city taking those damn pictures
dozens of confused and frightened residents of a small wealthy community just outside of boston converged on their church in order to pray and perhaps to receive a divine explanation for the series of inexplicable events that had occurred simultaneously an hour earlier
these were the events spinster hortense morrissa haggleston respected tory and pillar of the church had just eased herself and with a complacent sigh was decorously rising from her chamberpot when she happened to glance down
she screamed and fainted
fortunately she fell backward across the bed and not on top of the infant who lay cooing on the floor between her feet
the honorable judge william bortwright sat down with his famliy for their evening meal
he was justifiably pleased with himself having had a good constructive day on the bench
he had sentenced three vagrants to long jail terms imprisoned one editor banished a war of independence veteran from the town for indiscreet imbibing of alcoholic beverages and had a seventeenyear old girl flogged for kissing her lover in public
now while saying grace he modestly took the opportunity to beg of god that he cast an approving glance upon his the judges good works by blessing their humble repast
amen
they all looked up to find spinster chamberpot sloshing full in the middle of the table
simultaneously the maid rushed in panicstricken to announce that the baby had disappeared
a farmer sat down to milk his cow and reached for her udders only to find his arms immersed to the elbows in a tureen of beef stew
elsie he whispered incredulously is this the pastors wife walked out of the kitchen to wake her husband for dinner
she never made it
instead she found herself clinging for dear life to the very top of the meetinghouse spire a second later her husband woke up to find himself in bed with a cow
the general nature of the other events can easily be surmised
when tenyear old merlin klobbet was informed of the police commissioners decision to impound his aremac he had a tantrum to end all tantrums
he screamed and gnashed his teeth he tore out clumps of hair until his scalp bled he clawed at his face and ripped his clothes he threw himself down writhed convulsively kicked his heels on the floor and banged his head repeatedly against the legs of the furniture
the round table fell silent as king arthur reached up with great dignity and plucked the palegreen bottle from the top of his bejewelled crown
all sat breathless as arthur studied the smeared sticky object
presently he turned to one of the knights beside him and said pray tell me good sir galahad knowst thou the meaning of this legend here inscribed

pandemonium reigned in brewster auditorium last night
the main selection of the concert was to have been gustave rauchlitz daring new battle symphony
the work famous for its bombastic qualities is scored for two machineguns one small cannon an exploding powderkeg and a thunder making machine of the composers design in addition to the usual full orchestra
before the first movement was half finished the terrified audience was frantically clawing its way out of a forest of gigantic weird sculptures that had suddenly sprung up all over the auditorium
several people were injured in the crush
an elevenyear old boy who was seen leaving the concert with a suspiciouslooking bag under his arm was detained for questioning
he denied having any connection with the events of the evening
when questioned about the contents of the bag he opened it and proudly showed the police an object that looked like a cylinder with an eartrumpet attached
he said that it was a transmogrifyer and that he had made it himself
he explained that it converts sounds into beau110 tiful solid forms
he identified himself as merlin klobbet the greatest inventor in history
extract from a report read at an annual staff meeting at clearhead sanitarium a mental hospital in upper new york state
patient was placed in our custody one year ago as a result of his involvement in the famous brewster auditorium riot
has shown no improvement to date
has frequent temper tantrums and does not get along with other patients
he amuses himself by playing with a peculiar little machine that produces delightful threedimensional abstract figures when he sings gently into it
he refers to himself as merlin the miraclemaker
the sabertooth and the neanderthaler faced one another on the narrow ledge
the tigers muscles were tensed for the spring and the man stood with his heavy club raised over his head ready to deliver a crushing blow
the tiger leaped and the man disappeared
the tigers claws and teeth slashed through empty space and its momentum carried it over the ledge and down into a thornbush
it staggered away bloody mewing pitifully to become the first vegetarian cat in history
the neanderthal man somehow ended up in rome almost fiftythousand years later where he was captured tamed and eventually became the outstanding gladiator of the day
patient neither improves nor deteriorates
condition has remained unchanged during the entire twentynine years that he has been with us
spends all his time producing strange inventions
latest creation is a puttylike substance that changes its atomic structure instantly when middle is played on the piano
patient showed us how it works
in the space of five minutes to the accompaniment of the one note played over and over again this lump of stuff changed in rapid succession into a puddle of water a piece of lead a bar of soap a pile of ashes a cube of bronze a slab of rubber and a quivering chunk of protoplasm
patient says it is impossible to tell in advance what this substance will turn into but he has hopes dozens of confused and frightened residents of a small wealthy community on the outskirts of boston finished their prayers and were leaving the church
they had just reached the bottom steps when they were engulfed in a blinding storm of in garbage
they stood petrified and for a full minute were savagely pelted by chicken bones pieces of moldy cheese slices of salami rotten tomatoes banana peels etc
the cloudburst was over as quickly as it had begun and the people hastened back into the church to pray again with renewed vigor
patient klobbet has escaped from clearhead
another patient claims to have heard him at the piano playing the same note hes been playing for the past ten years
according to this witness the music stopped after which there was a minute of dead silence
then klobbet was heard to yell got it i finally got it
goddammit
i got it i got it i the underworld is buzzing with the story of how pedro scondrilla quasilegal international fence paid fivemillion dollars in cold cash for the biggest diamond in history
scondrilla says that he doesnot know the sellers name or who he is but that he checked thoroughly before he put up the dough and everything is legitimate
this is a onehundred percent straight clean deal he told reporters totally and completely on the up and up
i donot know who the guy is hes kinda weird i admit but that is positively not a hot rock
you got my word for it and you can ask any cop or dealer in the whole censored world if ya donot believe me
a tall cadaverous man with wild eyes and unkempt hair entered a bowling alley near peekskill and sought out the owner a mr clarence kelly
mr kelly he said interested in renting the vacant cabin behind your bowling alley
what did you say your name was kelly asked looking at the man with obvious distaste
my name the man said shoving out his bony chest is merlin the mir ah
merlin klobbet
his words came muffled around a wet weedy cigar marvin corbett
kelly said
as yet
look mr kelly i need the place
to store a few things and theres some work i have to do you see pay you a good price well kelly rubbed his chin doubtfully
this guy looked like a real oddball
a character
but then again the alley had seen better days
he weakened
you sure you want it just a junk house you know
anything we donot need thats where it goes be only temporary klobbet said
kelly said yours
fifty a week in advance and you gotta move the junk out yourself
klobbet was ecstatic
he ped five onehundred dollar bills into the amazed hand
this should do for a couple of months he said and theres lots more where that came from
he dashed off to the cabin leaving an acrid trail of smoke behind
and donot worry he shouted back over his shoulder take care of that junk
early that evening klobbet went out and returned with a huge carton loaded with assorted tools and hardware
next morning a truck arrived and deposited a load of lumber at the door of the cabin
klobbet came out rubbing his hands with delight paid the driver and hauled the lumber into the cabin singing in a loud tuneless voice the month that lowed the usual thumpings and rumbling of the bowling alley were intermixed with the sounds of hammering sawing and wiresnipping
this went on day and night punctuated irregularly by brief periods of silence during which klobbet either ate or slept
he left the cabin once every few days to shop for food at a supermarket nearby
the delicatessen counter was his favorite haunt in the store and after a while the area around the cabin developed a highly distinctive odor that was a blend of spiced meats pickles smelly cheeses sauerkraut and cigars curiosity got the better of him one day and he stopped klobbet outside the cabin
look mr corbett he said hesitantly know its none of my business but what the hells going on in there
klobbet glanced around furtively and clutched the shoppingbag to his chest
somewhere inside the bag a halfpound of cornedbeef yielded up its juices and greasy spots began to appear on his trousers
without answering he made off toward the cabin then stopped
he stood still for a moment thinking then turned back to kelly with a sly expression on his face
come on in he said show you
kelly stood in the dim light breathed the foul air reluctantly and looked around with revulsion
the place had always been a mess he remembered but nothing like this
the room was cluttered with machine parts tools bits of halfconsumed food old soiled clothes brimming cans of garbage wes old and stinking cardboard cartons of dusty nondescript rubbish piles of unmentionable offal a veritable museum of dryland flotsam and jetsam
this place looks and smells like a damn dump kelly said
when the hell are you gonna clean it out
squeamishly his gaze traveled through the room resting as briefly as possible on each disgusting object
then his eyes stopped locked in place
he had discovered the box facial muscles began to twitch with anticipation and his cigar began to shuttle excitedly from side to side in his mouth
the box was a large open cratelike affair decorated with a bizarre confusion of wires tubes and switches
it looked like an outsize coffin wired for sound
kelly walked around it impressed and mystified at the same time
no words came he simply stared the question at klobbet
klobbet licked his lips with a trembling tongue and cleared his throat a time machine he said softly
kelly looked at his tenant as though he were seeing him for the first time
klobbet stood there a slovenly fiercelooking man gray hair disheveled a tattered cigar waving in his mouth
you donot believe me he said tightly
you think lying
he stepped forward jerkily his hands stiffening into talons
danger hung in the air like an invisible thunderhead kook thought kelly real genuine nut
he glanced around for a possible weapon and quickly settled on a bowlingball which he snatched from a pile of discarded alley equipment
klobbet continued advancing a look of the purest malevolence twisting his face
kelly brought the ball up holding it protectively before him took a step backward tripped over something and toppled into the box
he lay there for a moment dazed still holding the ball and looking for all the world like a bowling champion in all his glory about to be laid to rest
the thing he heard was victory whoop as a lever was slammed down somewhere
the very last thing he heard was a flurry of guttural grunting voices
then a stone axe cracked open his skull and there was nothing danced around the empty box like a drunken gnome beside himself with joy it worked he chattered
the first try and it worked magnificent merlin did it again fifteen minutes later he was not so happy
something waswrong with the mechanism
sometimes the things he put in it would disappear presumably coming to rest somewhere in the vast continuum of time
other things went and came right back again
and there were things that appeared unbidden from god knows where or when
klobbet shivered with fright at the recollection of the apeman who had started out of the box to attack him but had accidentally touched a tube that instantly sent him back into the timestream
he glowered reprovingly at the box as though it had deliberately spitefully tricked him
then he took a screwdriver and made some adjustments
when he was satisfied he rummaged through a pile of junk and came up with a stained and scarred toiletseat
he placed this in the box and pulled the lever
the toiletseat vanished and he gave a tentative sigh of relief
a few seconds later he set the dial on and pulled the lever again but nothing happened
then suddenly the box began to tremble and heave and in another moment it lurched and spewed forth a load of fish that spread out in a wriggling carpet at his feet
he began to kick at the fish wildly then slipped and fell sending them flopping all over the room
he tore at his hair in frustration and hissing a stream of poisonous curses proceeded to shovel the fish back in the box with his bare hands
when he was finished he stood up shaking with rage scales shimmering in his hair one fish tail waving feebly from a pocket
as a final gesture he flung his cigar into the box hawked a huge gob of phlegm after it and slammed down the lever
everything went and didnot come back
he sat down lit a fresh cigar rested for a moment then grimly seized the screwdriver and went to work again
presently there was a blinding flash and klobbet fell back on his haunches gazing blankly into the box
it was sputtering and sizzling wires were jerking and switches snapping themselves on and off
deep within the recesses of the box scenes began to appear dimly and jerkily making klobbet think of the flickers of his youth
he thought he saw a farmer milking a cow a family at dinner a lady on top of a house and other similar domestic scenes
everybody seemed to be in early nineteenth century costume
he was just getting interested when the box gave a convulsive shudder and stopped he scenes faded
klobbet yanked some wires and twisted some tubes but nothing happened
in a state of growing anxiety he grabbed a hammer and started to pound the box mercilessly
still nothing happened
idiot machine he shrilled and with tears of frustration filling his eyes hurled the hammer into the box and gave it a vicious kick for good measure
the box rumbled protestingly and belched out a dinosaur egg
klobbet ducked and the egg struck the opposite wall broke and slithered to the floor leaving a slimy trail behind
the box was silent now
for several minutes the in115 ventor and his creation faced one another each waiting to see what the other would do next
tentatively klobbet regarded the box
he studied the wiring briefly changed a fuse and bent over to peer inside
suddenly it was as though a monster vacuum cleaner had been turned on
klobbet was sucked into the box with a loud vthloop
five seconds later he was spat back into the room water pouring from his clothes reeking from wet cigar and exotic perfume and quaking with fury
fiend he croaked at the box
imbecile
abortion be sorry you were ever invented then he went completely mad
he took a wrench and beat the lever permanently into the position then he began to pile everything he could get his hands on into the box
a case of empty coke bottles went in flrst
this was followed by a typewriter
next went the days delicatessen purchases then a dismantled radio a loaf of stale pumpernickel an empty oil can and a crate of broken household appliances in rapid succession
the box was having trouble digesting everything at once
it made plaintive gagging noises
delighted an expression of satanic glee lighting his features klobbet redoubled his efforts and jammed into the box a bundle of filthy clothes a pair of ragged sneakers and for a crowning touch the overflowing garbage pails
the box was heaped mountainhigh with churning refuse
eventually somehow the box lay empty again wheezing painfully and giving an occasional strangled gasp as sudden constrictions attacked its inner circuits
satisfied
klobbet gloated maliciously
then chuckling he delivered the coup de grace
he tore out the wires one by one smashed the fuses and condensers and splintered the delicate crystals into millions of tiny slivers
calmer now sated with revenge klobbet thought about the half hour that had elapsed since kelly had entered the cabin
in that short space of time he had personally singlehanded launched aeons of timeborne debris
at this very moment empty beer cans cigar butts dirty socks and soiled underwear were floating simultaneously past the noses of brontosauri and through the sterile streets of antigravity suburbs
an incredible feat spreading rubbish up and down through all eternity and he had done it alone himself merlin the most the victor stood and contemplated the body of his vanquished foe
it was all over now
continued on page 35k ink lie ove by men vm here to give you the scoop
the straight scoop
the man who is talking in the lingo of our profession is dark and serious he speakers name is slim jim
he is just twentyfour years old but already he is a veteran too old for active duty
there is a wild unholy look in his eyes which tells you even better than the scars on his face the hell hes been through
yet his hands are steady and his voice firm as he continues what is to be the first of a long series of indoctrination lectures donot know why you men signed up and not going to ask
perhaps you got into a little trouble at home
perhaps you were disappointed in love
whatever the reason thats your business
we donot ask questions here
the important thing is that youre here and its my business to teach you what you have to know to stay alive
some of you will not live to complete your tours
the ones who make it may owe your lives to what youre going to learn these next few weeks
so pay attention
your instructors are tough hardened veterans
you will do well to listen to them
tell us man we say
give us the clue
the enemy is cunning and ruthless and outnumbers you a thousand to one
they possess an almost suicidal courage
they never sleep
their spies are everywhere
their communications system makes a modern radio look like a childs toy
the enemy will ambush you when you least expect it and they take no prisoners let me repeat gentlemen they never take prisoners never forget the chill that runs down my spine at these last words
for the first time i am scared
i mean really scared
oh seen the newsreels and read the papers
but it doesnot seem real somehow
you always figure it wonot happen to you
to the other guy maybe but not to you on top of the world and nothing bad can happen
but this is different than just reading about it
i mean slim jim has been there faced them and hes lived to tell about it
for the first time i begin to wonder if it is worth it
i remember that wonderful feeling i had the day i signed up that wonderful things are bound to happen feeling that sets the blood to racing with the promise of adventure and excitement
of course mom was bawling like i was already dead and dad had that tight set look on his face like he was at a funeral or something
he kept saying now mother hes old enough to know his own mind
but his voice was thick and i knew he was taking it harder than she was
down deep i mean
i remember the night before i left my girl friend ella came over to say good bye and for the first time she really kissed me
i mean really kissed me
it was great
just great
cloud nine stuff
if youve ever gone to war you know what i mean
it seems to affect girls that way
but now as i listen to the quiet lecture by slim jim i realize i am not immune
yes it could happen to me
in just a few short weeks our group has to be ready to face them
i look at jo jo ko ko and bo bo the other members of my group and i can see they are scared too
it is a solemn moment weeks later we open in des moines iowa
and there for the first time we see them
teenage girls
hundreds of them
girls in skirts and sweaters
girls in bobby socks and twotone shoes
smart girls and dull ones girls from suburbia and girls from the slums
girls chewing gum and girls with glasses
they fill the air with their shrieks and screams they create thunder with their feet
they fill the hall with an excitement that is so real you can almost reach out and touch it
and their nails glisten blood red in the reflected light
we hit em with everything we have
electric guitars and drums are all set for maximum amplification
we donot hold back
we open up with pagan baby and then swing right into panther lady
what i mean we are a swinging group
we face them and we leave them in the aisles
we canot do anything wrong tonight
jo jo and his jungle rhythm boys are a big success
oh i donot mean we arenot scared
anyone would be scared standing up there on that lighted stage in full view knowing that there is nothing between you and them but a few flimsy floodlights and a half dozen ineffectual polls licemen
you try to tell yourself that they are just normal teenage girls like you see everyday on the street but you know it isnot so
tonight they are the enemy
you can hear it in their thin shrill voices you can see it in their wide bright eyes and you can feel it in the rhythm of their beating feet
we wind up our first show with congo congo the one where jo jo advances to the front of the stage and sings the melody while the rest of us give him a chanting jungle background
it has a tricky sixfour beat that really sets em back
half way through the number about thirty girls charge the stage
you have to hand it to jo jo
the guy has guts
he doesnot lose a note
he just leans back and belts it out with all he has
he hits them square in the face with rhythm amplified twenty times
the advancing line wavers then breaks
fourteen girls faint
we know now we have won our first engagement
we hardly have any trouble at all this first night in leaving the theater
jo jo has managed to get a copy of the city sewer line plans so we simply slip into a manhole in the darkened alley behind the theater and come out four blocks away we meet them headon in kansas city and we lay them in the aisles in st louis
in cincinnati we knock em dead
we are a swinging group with lotsa rhythm amplified twenty times
we are learning fast and so far we are lucky
except for minor scrapes and bruises and a few torn clothes we havenot had a casualty
by the time we get to chicago we are big time
now our training will be tested
we come into chicago by barge and check into our hotel
we have leaked word to the press that we would be arriving by plane at ohare field but we know they will have the other public transportation systems watched too
so while two thousand girls battled two hundred uniformed police at the airport we are safely checked in at our hotel
the hotel of course has installed bars on our windows stationed guards in the corridors and removed all moveables from the lobby
for the moment then we are comparatively safe
jo jo goes over the plan of operations
men he says have here a detailed plan of the auditorium the connecting sewers and the surrounding terrain
you will notice this open ground here on the north side of the auditorium
there is some cover of course here on the west but unfortunately if we use the west entrance we will have to cross this exposed street
it looks bad
we can all see that do we get in
i ask
plan jo jo replies
there is a momentaiy silence
plan means well have to disguise ourselves as girls which with our hairdos means well simply put on dresses and lipstick
yes jo jo continues plan big time now and we gotta take our chances
ko ko youll be the swing man work our way through the crowd as close as possible to the west door and then youll yell as loud as you can there they are there they are
over there
we canot hope to move against the flow of the crowd but we can pretend to faint and take our chances on being trampled
as soon as theyve moved away from us we all make a break for the door at the count of three
at the count of three
got it men got it we say
now for the withdrawal he says
disguise is out of the question and the server lines leading from the auditroium arenot big enough going to try something new going to sing our way out he pauses to let that one sink in
yessir well march right through their middle in a direct frontal assault with the amplifiers on full blast
when we reach the exit he pauses again
when we reach the exit gentlemen well run like hell a good plan so simple like most good plans are
it might have worked too if ko ko hadnot gotten careless
we get in just like wed planned with nothing more than a couple of cracked ribs and a few miscellaneous bruises and contusions
we put on our show and then as we begin our finale we start walking straight down the aisle dragging our extention cords behind us
they are so near we can reach out and touch them with our bare hands
jo jo is leading the way while ko ko is protecting the flank
we are only twenty feet from the rear exit when it happens
ko ko stumbles
he recovers quickly but it is too late
somehow he has disconnected the extention cord for his electric guitar
he has lost his amplification happens next will be forever etched in my memory is nothing we can do to save him
we have to stand helplessly by and watch it happen
they moved in screaming for a lock of his hair a piece of his shirt anything say this for ko ko he is going down fighting strumming his dead guitar to the last although he surely realizes it is hopeless
he disappears in a scrambled sea of faces arms and legs and fingers which glisten blood red in the reflected light
poor ko ko is never to be seen again
my first reaction to ko death is surprising
i am glad he is dead
yes glad
glad it is him instead of me
later of course i feel guilty about having felt glad until jo jo explains that this is normal
in fact he admits he feels the same way himself
i feel better after that
but somehow the group isnot the same without ko ko
we go on naturally
the show has to go on
but it just isnot the same without ko ko
we get a replacement a young kid fresh out of training who thinks a sewer is for rats and that tearaway shirts and tearaway pants are for cowards
i figure hell last two weeks
two weeks is all i give him
i get a letter from ella the first one in a long time
it begins dear john my name isnot john and something snaps in my mind
could she have meant the letter for someone else
it drives me crazy thinking about it
our next show is yankee stadium in new york city
the really big show maybe even a full thirty minutes
we arrive at the stadium a day ahead of time and headquarter beneath the bandstand until the following evening
hour by hour we can feel the big stadium filling up
we are surrounded but at least we have reached the stage
jo jo explains the escape plan
we will use a helicopter
it will be another first for jo jo
the guys always thinking always two steps ahead of the opposition
hour by hour the pressure mounts
the great stadium is overflowing
already the screams of the crowd are blotting out all other existence
the group we are to follow finishes its act
against our wills we peek out from our hiding place beneath the bandstand
the cover boys are mounting an armored tank and trying to wedge their way through the crowd
the fools jo jo murmurs
we watch as a hundred unhurried hands overturn the tank and spill its contents onto the fresh green earth of the stadium
we wonder if grass which has tasetd blood will ever again be satisfied with water
something breaks inside me not going not going up there i cry
jo jo slaps my face
shut up he says
get hold of yourself man
he slaps me again softer this time
we are all depending on you he adds as the tears come to my eyes
he turns to the others
now check your amplifiers and lets get up there
i donot say ansrthing
the others are looking at me strangely
then i have this sudden inspiration
i donot know why i havenot thought of it before
of course
that had to be the answer
tm all right now i say shyly
i am too so simple once you figure it out
we go onstage
there must be over eightythousand of them out there
but not scared
not any more
as we do the show i notice jo jo glancing up to make sure the helicopter is still hovering overhead
jo jo is always so very careful
but its all so unnecessary
i mean finally figured it out
i think they love me
think about that for a moment
we do our last number and the helicopter lowers on schedule
jo jo and the others try to force me aboard but i wonot go
i canot bear to think of disappointing eightythousand adoring fans
why theyd give anything just to touch me just to have a piece of the clothes which i wear or a lock of my hair
how can i disappoint these nice kids

and here they come
what looks like the foundation stones of a new saga are beginning to shape up in some issues back we published roger passage to dilfar
now the saga of diivish and his magic steed that men called black enters its second instalment with song a tale of a beautiful young girl a legend a witch and a creature from the depths of also the concluding installment of keith web novel the other side of time
june goes on sale at your newsstand may by worlds of weird edited by leo margulies pages
pyramid books here is the second of what i trust is going to be an infinite series of paperback anthologies from the files of the legendary fantasy magazine weird tales
seven more stories drawn from the fertile period when farnsworth wright was still in editorial command make up this new volume
if it doesnot quite match the high level of its predecessor thats not a serious fault in view of the standard set the first time out
the most powerful story in this volume is valley of the worm by robert howard a littleknown item set in a world of norse mythology
connoisseurs of rugged prose will relish such high moments as this as the heronarrator launches his climactic attack on the wormmonster the spongy skin yielded and gave beneath my feet and i drove my sword hiltdeep dragging it through the pulpy flesh ripping a horrible yardlong wound from which oozed a green slime
then a flip of a cablelike tentacle flicked me from the titans back and spun me three hundred feet through the air to crash among a cluster of giant trees
they donot make monsters like that any more or heroes for that matter
another good one is edmond he that hath wings which should help to dispel the belief that thirty years ago hamilton was capable of writing only formula spaceopera
this story is moving and sensitive with a depth of emotion rarely found in the pulp stories of that era

and david deceptively simple the thing in the cellar is still good for a shudder or three even now
frank belknap giants in the sky though minor is a sciencefiction story whose imagery is often rewarding to the reader
the two longest stories in the book attempt more and are not entirely successful at it
seabury famous christmas story roads has many admirers and i do not feel diposed to criticize it it tells the story of a northman named klaus who is present at bethlehem and at calvary and who survives to take on a role in christian mythology himself prose is worthy of his theme and the notion of a worshipper of odin kneeling before the infant jesus is superb but i am troubled by anachronisms in the story and by the fact chat quinn lapses too often into cinematic cliches that mar an otherwise flawless accomplishment
the last story is nictzin dyalhis the sapphire goddess and i found it hard to enter its mood of whimsy
virgil finlay has contributed illustrations for the book most of them ruined by horrendous reproduction
a particular highlight is sam moskowitz brief introduction which tells of the founding of wexrd and provides information never seen in print before
the tithetic man by theodore sturgeon pages
pyramid books before the first issue of fantastic appeared ziffdavis used to publish a magazine called fantastic thick and raggededged and full of improbable tales
in the february issue of that defunct magazine there appeared a complete novel called the dreaming jewels by theodore sturgeon whose opening paragraph has rarely been rivaled for sheer audacity
it read they caught the kid doing something disgusting out under the bleachers at the highschool stadium and he was sent home from the grammar school across the street
he was eight years old then been doing it for years
the reader who survived that trumpetcall found himself enmeshed in a fantasyworld of almost uncomfortable vividness
the backgiound was carnival life and most of the characters were freaks but sturgeon never played it for pure horror nor lapsed into the sentimentality that seems to engulf bradbury whenever he approaches similar themes
the result was one of most successful novels wholly unforgettable
some time later it appeared in book form under its present less evocative title and here it is in a third printing with a handsome new schoenherr cover painting
there arenot many fantasy novels that match the wild poetry and fevered invention of this one

the spot of life by austin hall pages
ace books last time out i dumped some bricks on the goofy illwritten novel to which this is the sequel the blind spot
not at all suiprisingly ace has now produced the companion volume
a bit to my mystification i find that it is both better and worse than the first
the blind spot was written by hall in collaboration with homer eon flint and scarcely makes sense from one paragraph to the next
the present book which dates from is the work of hall alone
it is much more orderly the prose is grammatical if drab and the story line progresses neatly toward its conclusion the trouble too
the blind spot for all its monumental flaws had a kind of breathless foolishness about it that made it fun to read if you can find fun in watching authors working close to the line of illiteracy
there is no such fun in the spot of life which plods along from step to step in the unraveling of its dreary mysteries much shorter missing the baroque overelaboration of the earlier book and lacks even the feeble spark of life that one had
convention annual no
discon edition edited by jay klein pages inclusion of this item here is justified by the fact that its a pictorial account of the world convention held in washington as anyone who has ever attended one knows a convention is an experience of pure fantasy and so this is a fantasy book if there ever was one
jay kay klein is a deft man with a photoflash who gets all over a convention recording it all on film without ever seeming to intrude on the scenes hes immortalizing
this bulky volume has photos of the convention well reproduced
each of them has a lengthy descriptive caption revealing an unexpected comic flair on part
he has some good fun with hans stefan santesson takes cheerful pokes at sam moskowitz and john campbell and slyly nudges cele goldsmith lalli once or twice
aside from those notables youll find photos of everyone else who was on hand both at the formal sessions and at the including the likes of isaac asimov smith forry ackerman murray leinsterwill jenkins edmond hamilton and leigh brackett emsh james blish judy merril frederik pohl and a few hundred others

the books available from klein at sabine street syracuse new york the first men in the moon by wells pages
ballantine books wells is now going into the public domain in this country and paperback editions of his works spring up on all sides
this one written more than sixty years ago is being reissued in connection with its release as a motion picture in dynamation and lunacolor a fact that might have startled its author a bit if he had been able to look forward from the turn of the century to see its ultimate fate
the story ought to be familiar the one about the english gentlemen who build a spaceship covered with an antigravity metal and float off to the moon which is populated and involved in turmoil fine fun and stanton coblentz has rewritten it only thirty times so far so the original is worth examining mistake it for sciencefiction though pure fantasy as even jules verne grumbled long ago market place per word including name and address

he was a selfstyled inventor who spent all his time designing and building odd contrivances
this hobby was encouraged by the hospitals officials since it kept him harmlessly busy and out of trouble
he had been allowed to use the basement as an experimental laboratory
another patient who saw the whole thing through a cellar window described the terrifying event klobbet was standing at his workbench when all of a sudden the basement was full of water
just a kind of deep gurgly gwoosh and it was full
just like that
he never had a chance
the water flushed him right off his feet turned him every which way sideways and upside down getting him all tangled up in his own arms and legs and clothes
