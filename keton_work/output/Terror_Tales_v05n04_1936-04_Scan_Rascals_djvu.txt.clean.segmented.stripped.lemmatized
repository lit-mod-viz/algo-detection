a will day long i have be hope against hope that young philip rice would reach palo alto plantation house by supper time 
for a full year -PRON- have hear nothing from -PRON- have almost ven up any expectation of ever hear from -PRON- jin 
so -PRON- old heart be set flutter a bit by that peremptory knock and i go to the door -PRON- 
birt when i reach -PRON- old jude have already open -PRON- 
i catch a glimpse of bob shane the only taxi driver in the county as -PRON- hurry down the gravel walk toward the gate 
only a glimpse for -PRON- be almost out of sight behind the jasmine bush and -PRON- old eye have be draw as by a magnet to the stranger who stand in the doorway look into the gather shadow of the hall 
i canot describe -PRON- 
-PRON- be tall and slender and dark with a face of free wild beauty 
-PRON- eye be black that black which be a total absence of light and when -PRON- look at -PRON- i be lose in -PRON- completely fill with that insane desire which come to some man on the summit of high place the desire to hurl oneself over the parapet to the ground below 
for with all -PRON- beauty and grace there be about -PRON- something dreadful sometliing terrifying 
if -PRON- will pardon this intrusion the stranger begin 
and -PRON- voice match the rest of -PRON- 
-PRON- be low and vibrant 
at the sound of -PRON- i feel an icy hand close hard around -PRON- heart bring a memento from young philip rice the voice be continue leave -PRON- down south there 
-PRON- make a curious gesture with -PRON- long slender beautiful hand 
never have i see such hand as -PRON- so sensitive so capable 
i be an old man and shock be bad for -PRON- 
i stand there gasp 
a then quite unexpectedly -PRON- smile and i know at once that -PRON- fear be foolish 
i could see that -PRON- be just an extraordinarily handsome man who be ask hospitality at a door which for more than a hundred year have refuse hospitality to none 
come in i beg in confusion 
the place be crowd and afraid i must put -PRON- in sherburne room speak hesitantly for -PRON- never use that room at all 
-PRON- have be call a haunted room ever since sherburne rice the second hurl a man out of -PRON- and down the north stairway to the death of a break neck in the garden 
but this be all eve when all of -PRON- gather to celebrate tbe date of the house build 
every room but that be full and i be imwille to thrust so strange a guest upon any of -PRON- kin 
-PRON- smile queerly be sure i shall be at home there -PRON- say 
-PRON- name be minos dis and i come from a strange far country 
as i say i have bring a remembrance from -PRON- kinsman philip rice 
for -PRON- 
i ask 
i admit -PRON- voice be eager 
young philip have occupy the limelight at the family gathering last year 
-PRON- be an explorer with an already brilliant and bewilderir history in spite of -PRON- youth 
again the stranger smile that strange haunt extraordinary smile do not know yet for whom -PRON- be intend -PRON- answer and -PRON- voice though low and very very quiet have something dreadful in -PRON- some hint of doom unthinkable have come to learn 
and be philip -PRON- make a slight gesture with one perfect hand 
-PRON- silence -PRON- as if those slend finger have dose around -PRON- throat shall tell -PRON- all presently be all -PRON- say 
i -PRON- lead the way upstairs to sherburne room 
i do -PRON- reluctantly but i could see nothing else to do 
and yet somehow as i open the door into that orderly but long disused room i feel that there be a certain significance a certain fitness in usher that man into that particular room 
i could not umlerstand why i should feel so but i do 
i see to -PRON- comfort and leave -PRON- there in that fear and haunted room 
and as i walk away through the dim old hallway toward the stair the man strange and foreign sound name keep echoit through -PRON- mind 
-PRON- have somehow a faint familiarity 
minos 
have that not be the name of a fabled king of crete 
a straie name and a strange man who lay claim to -PRON- surely 
but then -PRON- hoise have icmg be use to strangeness and to heartbreak and to dread 
-PRON- be an cdd house a pioneer house build solidly and substantially of brick 
there be heavy iron bar at window 
there be a huge pantry behind the kildien and a deep cistern under the floor 
and -PRON- time -PRON- people have be thankful for thinga 
for palo alto have a dark and flameshot history 
-PRON- say that pirate gold build -PRON- and that pirate and huecaneer try tg raid -PRON- in the old day 
and -PRON- be certain that withstand a siege in by santa man and a grim and furious battle fight up and down hs stairway in sixtyfive 
and more heroic still when one of -PRON- woman be maroon there in the flood of ninety nine -PRON- fight off the hungry drirfccrazed black and save -PRON- and -PRON- two baby girl from horror indescribable 
a strong hard breed tfiose child of fearfully remember sherburne rice who come back each thirtyfirst of october which be the date ifl the cornerstone to celebrate the building of -PRON- bouse strange thing hpen yet something always brii -PRON- together again tiio very fascinaticm perhaps of the autre and the unpredictable 
and -PRON- very terror urge -PRON- to make of -PRON- a very festive occasion even riotous with all the trapping and old wine bring up from the cdlar where rodney wife be once wall up alive 
at least -PRON- be always glad to see each other and -PRON- always make a volant effort to be gay with game and dancing and laughter 
but -PRON- be not gay this year -PRON- be dusk when i find patricia rice stand alone on the wide front gallery watch the darkness inarch down the turgid river 
and i know -PRON- be think of that time thirtysix year ago when the high ground the house stand on be an island in a sweep of muddy swirling water and shft stand tliere alone patricia be an old woman now a grave and sensitive and understanding woman and some people say a little psychic at time 
-PRON- speak without look at -PRON- donot like -PRON- jerry 
something be go to happen and -PRON- always queer thing that ha in this house awful thing think of the old day i tell -PRON- 
-PRON- isnot that altogether 
i can feed something have as eerie a feeling as when i carry -PRON- baby into the burial vault out yonder to escape those madden black 
of course i do way remember too niuch when i come here jerry 
i canot forget that i stand guard beside the bone of sherburne rice the pirate and sherburne rice the terrible of reconstnrction day 
i canot forget that -PRON- be the negro terror of those very bone that save -PRON- and -PRON- baby 
but i live through horror too 
and i have to 
dll two man 
-PRON- do something to -PRON- jerry gve -PRON- a cert power 
and i tell -PRON- something horrible be hover over -PRON- something more horrible than anything that have happen yet wish young philip rice be on -PRON- way i uneasily be so long 
but couldnot go on 
and for a while -PRON- stand in silence -PRON- who be old and who remember such strange thing 
as for philip come to s that year for the first time 
not one of -PRON- have ever see -PRON- before 
-PRON- have just get back then from an explore trip into the heart of south america somewhere where white man have never be before 
-PRON- have try to fly over an inaccessible jungle -PRON- explain but the plane have crash 
-PRON- have come down in the outskirt of a city as yet unknown to white man a bewilderingly lovely desert city 
-PRON- eye grow rapt as -PRON- talk about -PRON- -PRON- seem to be lose in memory 
-PRON- own enthusiasm fire even -PRON- earthbound imagination 
-PRON- make -PRON- feel that place -PRON- unimaginable splendor -PRON- beauty -PRON- vastness -PRON- unthinkable antiquity 
and as -PRON- talk -PRON- seem to -PRON- to be the very quintessence of the rice to be possess of all -PRON- charm -PRON- beauty -PRON- love of adventure and -PRON- valor without those dark quality for which so many of -PRON- have be fame 
i love the boy and i hate the way -PRON- eye be hold by moma lane 
a tribe of indian mayas live near the city -PRON- tell -PRON- but -PRON- never enter -PRON- except for religious ceremony and even then -PRON- bar -PRON- out 
so -PRON- have to explore -PRON- by stealth take -PRON- life in -PRON- hand at every venture within -PRON- sacred wall 
-PRON- have stiunble all by accident upon a mayan treasure house 
the native would have kill -PRON- if -PRON- have know 
for these mayas have a rabid dread of white man 
around -PRON- fire at night -PRON- tell strange old legend of the conquistador horrify tale of pillage and torture and enslavement 
there would never be another invasion of white man into -PRON- land -PRON- swear 
yet paradoxically -PRON- have welcome philip offer -PRON- membership in -PRON- tribe make of -PRON- a sort of reincarnation of -PRON- fair god 
and i could understand that look at -PRON- down the table 
-PRON- be one of those fortunate whom people love at sight 
certainly -PRON- whole family fall in love with -PRON- that night 
and -PRON- 
well -PRON- fall in love with moma lane the stepdaughter of one of -PRON- many cousin 
-PRON- be one of those fair girl whose beauty seem to shine to dazzle men eye 
and -PRON- be captivate with philip or with the thing -PRON- stand for 
-PRON- eye be lock together while -PRON- tell -PRON- tale 
-PRON- be breathless eager 
and -PRON- beg -PRON- to go back 
but -PRON- must -PRON- cry -PRON- see 
-PRON- bring nothing out with -PRON- 
-PRON- have no proof of -PRON- discovery 
go back get picture and specimen and astonish the world 
bring -PRON- a mayan amulet phil 
philip laugh and shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- know the danger -PRON- see 
if -PRON- have be a sort of god among the mayas before -PRON- escape should now return 
-PRON- make -PRON- shiver even to guess at -PRON- punishment 
besides the mayas have be in the habit of sacrifice the incarnation of -PRON- god 
that old puzzle heathen idea that the essence of the human god must go back at state time to keep the godhead strong be one of the fundamental of -PRON- religion 
no one know that well than philip 
yet -PRON- do return to -PRON- mayan city 
-PRON- hear about -PRON- later and the news have make -PRON- heart sink as if under leaden weight 
i be an old man and i have love that boy 
and now some one have come wlio claim to bring -PRON- news of -PRON- 
but how weird and strange a messenger yes i believe with patricia tliat something be go to happen 
something dreadful 
something far bad than merely strange one of the darkie would go to sherburne room to summon -PRON- strair guest to supper 
-PRON- make various plausibleseeming excuse but i understand 
-PRON- be afraid 
so i climb the weary stair -PRON- stair that have be track with human blood these many tune 
-PRON- liand a little as i knock on sherburne door 
that strange weirdly melodious voice bid -PRON- enter but i do no more than open the door 
the stranger stand bareheade in the lamplight 
the unearthly beauty of -PRON- strike -PRON- with new force 
-PRON- ey be so lose in that compelling gaze of -PRON- that i be barely conscious of the box -PRON- hold between -PRON- hand not a large tox but extraordinary like everythit else about -PRON- 
-PRON- have tlie look of have be make of a single opal yet impossible as that seem i know that i think nothing of -PRON- at the time 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head slowly at mention of supper beed to be excuse 
-PRON- would join -PRON- later -PRON- say 
and such be the sprfi -PRON- have -PRON- under that i no protest though deep down in -PRON- be an almost paralyzing fear 
a guest who wmdd not eat -PRON- salt or brealt -PRON- bread with -PRON- be not that a gurat truly to be fear but as i turn away from titat hate room a queer chokedoff cry jerk -PRON- thoiht away 
terror lend -PRON- strength 
i hurry to door and jerice -PRON- open and lunge inside 
-PRON- be stand by the hearth in the full light of the tall white candle on the mantel 
-PRON- face be ghastly and -PRON- hold both hand to -PRON- tiiroat 
-PRON- eye have tiiat supernatural look -PRON- sometimes have 
as i cry out at -PRON- in terror -PRON- lower iter hand and turn to loc at -PRON- 
slowly -PRON- eye regain -PRON- sanity 
-PRON- swallow hard think for an instant that something have -PRON- by the throat be throttle -PRON- -PRON- whisper shakily 
i donot know 
if sherburne bice be walk -PRON- may be a ghastly business jerry 
-PRON- would be like liira to want to avenge -PRON- kinsman if -PRON- voice die in a hoarse rattle in -PRON- throat 
i get patricia downstairs someliow 
a buriness that aipper 
one of -PRON- sudden norther strike the ace just as the meal be serve 
before the fire could be build up to give adequate warmth the house be staridy cold 
-PRON- be all shiver when -PRON- come to the loaded table 
and the wind be cry in a bmishee dirge through the leave of the live oak keoie under the eave aioimd the cornice of the old house 
a hound down in the quarter li fte -PRON- voice in the eerie howl that tell -PRON- death be pass 
and the negro move on noiseless foot -PRON- dark skin grey -PRON- eye wild -PRON- hand aquivcr with terror 
and i could think of nothing but young philip rice whose infatuation for an emptyheade girl have send -PRON- into what must have be unthinkable and of the stranger who claim to ame from lum mid of the cooleye smile moma lane who sit acnoss tiie table from -PRON- 
-PRON- old folk sit about the fire in the back parlor after supper and listenal to the shriek of the rise wind and tell tale under -PRON- breatlj of the bloody deed of shelburne rice the bucaam and of -PRON- grandscai sherburne rice the second 
and while -PRON- whisper of past terror and bloody deed the young petle dance in the big front parlor bob for apple look in mirror and have -PRON- fortune tc 
but -PRON- attempt at gaiety be futile 
the bht of tlte stranger presence be on -PRON- too 
-PRON- be midnight when the strainer come into the dim temjdight of the room wliere -PRON- be wmte 
the box i have see in the haunted room iqstair be in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that a little chilly wind not bom of the shriek norther outside come in with -PRON- 
and the far away howl of the dog have now become an anguished madden whine of fright 
the music in the front room cease 
the young people crowd in witii -PRON- and sink down upon stool and cushion around the fire 
morna eager piquant face stand out startlingly iu the soft light 
i could not keep -PRON- old eye away from -PRON- -PRON- seem so excited so avid for the news that be come 
and suddenly i know that i hate -PRON- 
and the stranger stand in the wide doorway between the parlor and look at -PRON- with -PRON- unfathomable eye all know philip rice -PRON- state quietly in -PRON- grave deep organtoned voice 
-PRON- be kin to -PRON- 
some few of -PRON- murmur in assent 
philip have be kin to all of -PRON- except to moraa lane 
-PRON- go back to the village in the jungle the sonorous voice roll on 
-PRON- must have know that death await -PRON- there yet -PRON- be drive by a force -PRON- could not resist 
-PRON- pause and the silence be absolute except for the soft crackle of the fire and tlie wind and the howl dog 
-PRON- go back 
even then -PRON- may have escape -PRON- doom if -PRON- have be careful for -PRON- have friend among the mayas 
-PRON- be a remnant of a once highly civilized and mighty race as yet uncontaminated by intermarriage with other breed 
-PRON- great stone city be an amazing place 
-PRON- would marvel at -PRON- if i could make -PRON- see -PRON- 
where do the stone in -PRON- wall come from 
-PRON- be huge and expertly cut 
but what force bring -PRON- from -PRON- distant quarry what force lift -PRON- to -PRON- destine place in the tower wall 
no man know 
unthinkable wisdom those long dead mayas must have have unthinkable rich 
-PRON- ancient treasure house would make the rich treasury in -PRON- world look like a beggar pittance 
gold and strangely wrought ornament and glowii gem 
why do philip rice persuade the mayan girl who love -PRON- to take -PRON- there that place be holy 
-PRON- know -PRON- 
what untumable force could have send -PRON- there 
-PRON- black eye move from face to face and i see man and woman sway backward as -PRON- eye move over -PRON- even as a field of grain sway when a wind blow over -PRON- 
-PRON- take something exceedingly precious from that treasure house the stranger say very quietly 
and -PRON- eye come to rest on the opalescent box between -PRON- hand 
i see moma lane lean forward just a trifle as if to see -PRON- better 
but -PRON- face be inscrutable 
i could make nothing of -PRON- 
could -PRON- have care for philip and still betray no sign now that -PRON- must be dead the mayan girl love -PRON- with a selfless undemanding love 
-PRON- help -PRON- do the thing that -PRON- desire to do 
-PRON- show -PRON- a secret pass through the hill 
because -PRON- love -PRON- 
savage woman be like that sometimes women to whom love be everything even though the love one lia no thought for -PRON- as philip certainly have none for -PRON- 
-PRON- thought be all for the white girl who have send -PRON- back 
-PRON- be mad to get for -PRON- the bauble -PRON- demand 
and -PRON- be only through the native girl that -PRON- could get -PRON- so -PRON- take -PRON- and start home alone 
and -PRON- may have escape for the mayas make no attempt to pursue -PRON- 
-PRON- but send a messenger after -PRON- with the sever hand of the girl who have help -PRON- 
come back and burn -PRON- message say or -PRON- burn the woman instead -PRON- do not hesitate 
-PRON- go back 
and -PRON- give -PRON- body to -PRON- god scream 
i think the rest do too 
i couldnot 
-PRON- breath stick in -PRON- throat 
i be beyond the relief of any outcry 
i be stuni 
the stranger watch -PRON- with -PRON- relentless eye tlwase eye that be black with the blackness that be total absence of light 
-PRON- lift the priceless box that be neither large nor nall the box that seem to be make of a single firetinte opal in -PRON- perfect hand 
i bring back from the jungle -PRON- cry a pulse throbbir in -PRON- voice as the sacrificial drum must have throb in tile jungle while philip die 
-PRON- be mean for some one itere 
to whom do -PRON- belong 
-PRON- be beautiful that box 
-PRON- glow ml glory in the ligtit of the leap fire 
no rainbow in the world could ever have show such color color that wrkhe and burn mid fade and burn ain 
but -PRON- draw tck frwn -PRON- in horror 
-PRON- be accurse for all -PRON- beauty -PRON- be stain with another oolor that do not show 
the color of blood 
-PRON- belong to one of -PRON- the stranger say inexorably 
i see morna lane lean forward suddenly 
-PRON- gasp as a swimmer may gasp on tlie brink of an icy plunge 
-PRON- hand reach out draw back reach out again 
-PRON- try to speak and could not 
the stranger give -PRON- a long still look from -PRON- fathomless eye 
-PRON- be yours then -PRON- ask and -PRON- voice be husky and fill with deep vibratioiw like die music that come from the string of a bass viol 
still -PRON- could not speak 
but -PRON- nod jerkily and swallow hard and -PRON- outstretched finger clenrfie and unclenche and clench again in a spasm of desire 
-PRON- lay that lovely priceless thing within -PRON- grasp 
-PRON- turn slowly and walk away -PRON- head bent like a man who be very tired into the front parlor and across -PRON- into the hall 
i watdie -PRON- climb the stair slowly and sadly and yet with an air of duty do 
when -PRON- have pass from sight -PRON- eye come bad to that room of silence

i reach for the knob three time and fail before i could draw -PRON- erect 
swa dng there i find inside a suit of -PRON- dothe which grace must have bring as a childish mean of bolster hope that cme day i would wear -PRON- home

from the stair i could see faint shaft of moonlight now dimly illumine the low hall 
no one nothing down there i stand on the stair with tlie heavy bedrail poise strain -PRON- hearii as though by force of wffi i could penetrate the silence and hear this monstrous adversary 
at the bottom of the step i stand peer 
wan eerie patch of moonliglit by the window and so many shadow everywhere each of which may hold the lurk monster 
there be a little moonlight glow by the wall telephone 
witli every muscle alert i go there rest the heavy iron bar beside -PRON- and lift the receiver 
uncanny silence of the instrument like the uncanny silence of the house 
no buzz of current no distant operator inquire voice 
and then i see the cut wire dangle under the box 
the fiend have be here 
i could send no call for hp 
with a deepened sense of terror i seize the bedrail and flee back up the stair 
at the door of room i rap 
i call sliarply jack let -PRON- in and as the word be still echo i feel -PRON- heart contract as though as icy hand be clutchihg -PRON-

the wooden casement that hold the lock smash inward 
the door swing and go with -PRON- little moonlit bedroom be empty 
the window lock on the inside be undisturbed but edith and anne wwe go 
a stark panic descend upon -PRON- in that terrible moment so that i lunge and fling aside the heap of bedding shove wildly at the bureau as though by some diabolic necromancy the two girl may still be here though at a glance i have see -PRON- be not 
and then i see where -PRON- have go 
a panel of the wall show a narrow slit a slidir door here which when close be undiscemable 
but -PRON- be not quite closed now 
a doorway to some descend secret lair 
i shove -PRON- finger into the vertical open the panel slide sidewise and i launch -PRON- through brandish the bedrail 
i be merely in the adjoin bedroom a duplicate of with a white iron bed unmade moonlight through the close window 
no one here 
i stoop hurriedly search 
no one 
nothing 
the room single door be ajar -PRON- admit -PRON- back into the hall only a few foot from body 
so great a terror be on -PRON- now that i be hardly conscious of rational reasoning 
where have the fiend take -PRON- 
somewhere in this ghastly house ludvig lust for pleasure lust for the white beauty of young womanhood 
the room up here in which the two maniac girl be confine have the fiend take edith and anne there 
have the maniac girl come out and lure -PRON- i dash to that other door 
-PRON- still be lock 
i listen with ear to -PRON- panel 
no sound 
there be only -PRON- own pant breath and thump heart 
with the bedrail i burst in the door 
ghastly scene 
disheveled room of these maniac girl 
filmy garment strew and scatter 
a place of lust pleasure mute now with death death everywhere in this house 
a gust of wind from the open window meet -PRON- 
and there be enough moonlight glow so that i stand gape at the silent tragic scene 
the two maniac girl be here white body scantily clothe hair down 
one be sprawl on tlie floor with arm up on the all of the open window 
the other be beside -PRON- one arm over -PRON- companion hip 
both of -PRON- dead 
unmarke by violence 
for a moment i stand transfix peer down at -PRON- so pallid in the moonlight 
and i see now -PRON- slim body reveal by death to be waste to thinness 
pitiful little creature 
maniacs only with this strange lusting spell which have be upon -PRON- 
pinch thin cheek under the rouge body in life consume by the fire of -PRON- lust so that now in death -PRON- seem only pallid wraith of womanhood 
and on botii the contort face there be a frozen grimace as though even in death -PRON- be try wildly to laugh 
in that shocked moment i see also a curious aspect to these death posture 
a sort of stretching of the neck gape stretch mouthsas though the one at the window realize that death be upon -PRON- have stagger here fling up the sash and then fall and on the floor have again reach upward stretch with -PRON- mouth for the air too late to save -PRON-

the room be permeate with -PRON- cling saturate tin carpet these drapery 
for all the wind from tlie open window i smell -PRON- now more strongly than ever before 
and with every breath i be conscious of a itttle heady thrill to tny sense 
gruesome lethal breath that sme to hold a lure as i suck -PRON- in a wild pleasure of the sense that could only end in death 
i gather -PRON- wit 
edith and anne be not here 
i search the room peer along the wall for some loose panel 
and tlten brandish the iron brail futilely for there seem nothing but the dead remaming in this terrible house i flee back to the hall 
the rightangle turn to the left be here i dash around -PRON- 
be that a moving sliape off there the along the iiall

i think vaguely i may liave hear a sound behind -PRON- but -PRON- be engulf by a crash on ray tho world seem to split with a roar and a burst of brilliant light so that i be conscious only that the faedrail be clatter from -PRON- hand as fall 
orgy of death all -PRON- sense fade there be for -PRON- nothing but a blank abyss of empty soundless darkness 
death -PRON- may be like that 
but presently after some nameless interval i be aware that i be alive 
dimly conscious i could feel myseli lie on die floor with rope lash -PRON- wrist beliiod -PRON- and wrap around -PRON- ankle 
-PRON- sense fade again but i struggle this time to hold a little something whicli be -PRON- 
in the blackness there be the sound of a pant breath

the fabric of garment brush -PRON- 
and i could hear the breathing that be the swift triumph of a frenzy aboirt to be consummate 
then i be be carry half carry half drag with head and shoulder raise and -PRON- leg trail on the floor as this gibber adversary tug and pant with -PRON- sixfoot bulk

a liu mel tali for a chinese girl dress in occidental garb come to -PRON- then smile a little and give -PRON- -PRON- hand 
how soft -PRON- wasl -PRON- make -PRON- think of a beat heart a birds heart perhaps beat in the palm of the bird captor 
and after liu mei come kwan tao with a firm handshake whidi say more than any word -PRON- could have irttere beating of -PRON- own heart almost suffocate -PRON- as i step into the iiallway with liu mei 
and there be sorrow too that be deep than the well of shallaja 
i would have give -PRON- life for girl 
i could understand the grt love defy all prejudice all convention which must have bind this girl father to -PRON- mother 
and now both be dead and liu mei dwelt in the house of -PRON- aiid bear -PRON- name 
-PRON- put -PRON- liand on -PRON- arm as -PRON- walk to tlte electric elevator liu establislnnent combination office and residence be of five story and the stair be almost never use for travel between floor 
-PRON- suffocate -PRON- almost to stand in the tiny elevator with liu mei 
surely -PRON- must imow and li eye tell -PRON- that -PRON- do that -PRON- know -PRON- may never mention -PRON- 
i would never dare 
and because i would never dare i blurt out always love -PRON- liu mei 
-PRON- great desire be for -PRON- happiness 
-PRON- be very close to -PRON- then and -PRON- hand be still on -PRON- arm 
-PRON- perfume be in -PRON- nostril like the radiant ghost of -PRON- that may go with -PRON- always 
-PRON- eye tell -PRON- that -PRON- have always know 
be -PRON- fancy or do i see deep down in -PRON- depth some hint of love return 
i shake -PRON- head in the shock of the near revelation to drive away the image of tlie happiness that may have be our be -PRON- not for the barrier of blood 
tliere will never be another liu mei i say 
i press the button for the first floor and the cage start down 
liu mei as -PRON- pass tlie fourth floor reach out -PRON- hand and turn off the light in the cage 
i be alone in the dark with the woman of all woman whom i love and for a moment as the age go creak down the knowledge hdd -PRON- paralyzed 
i have look at -PRON- watch from force of habit when -PRON- have enter the cage 
ten minute after eleven at night 
by eleventhir i would have take liu mei to safety 
then i must bear -PRON- own strange cross in patience until -PRON- be take from -PRON- -PRON- hand have drop from -PRON- arm as though -PRON- be afraid of what i may do in -PRON- madness and i lock -PRON- lip tightly on whatever else desperation may have make -PRON- say 
the first floor be just below -PRON- 
i snap on the light again muster a smile and turn to lead -PRON- forth when the cage stop 
i couldnot believe -PRON- eye 
the cage hadnot stop move i would have swear totliat but lfu md be not with -PRON- 
-PRON- have vanish out of a move elevator as though -PRON- have turn to fog and eddy out through the grill into the shaft 
nor be that all 
five stalwart man in hideous devil mask have take -PRON- place 
i stare at -PRON- in amazement 
-PRON- couldnot be yet -PRON- be 
somewhere along the route from the fifth floor to the first liu mei have vanish and the five have take -PRON- place 
and the cage hadnot stop move 
-PRON- have be magic 
where be -PRON- 
i demand in shrill frightened cantonese 
go say one 
and -PRON- be an order that the meddling foreigner be punish so that never again will -PRON- be tempt to meddle 
the speaker press the button again and the cage start to ascend 
-PRON- stop -PRON- between the third and fourth floor 
as -PRON- go up i snap a glance at -PRON- watch 
-PRON- say eleventhirty 
the cage bearing liu mei and -PRON- have be twenty minute descend the speaker turn out the light 
i must have be paralyze with fear and surprise for i didnot even offer resistance 
in the dark the hand of the devil begin upon -PRON- 
-PRON- foot come into use too 
-PRON- kick -PRON- 
-PRON- claw -PRON- 
-PRON- batter away at -PRON- 
-PRON- rip clothing from -PRON- with -PRON- knife 
finally when -PRON- seem i could stand the agony no longer something heavy strike the top of -PRON- head 
the cage be fill with shoot star as the bottom seem to fall out of -PRON- drop -PRON- headlong into the shaft where i strike to find oblivion black as the deep night 
when i regain consciousness i be sprawl outside the elevator on the ground floor 
the outer door of course be close 
fog seep through under -PRON- to be absorb by the light 
i be alone in a building fill with echo and horror 
-PRON- hellish assailant be go 
i stagger to -PRON- foot 
-PRON- head be split 
i ache in every bone and muscle 
i vra a sixfooter who should have be able to put up a terrific battle but the five have handle -PRON- with ease give -PRON- the most brutal beat any man have ever have to take 
the seem miracle of the twentyminute descent the vanishing of liu mei the appearance of the five do not puzzle -PRON- as -PRON- may have any one who do not know the potentiality of chinese master mummer as i do 
i didnot leave though as the five or those who have send -PRON- must have expect 
-PRON- do not know -PRON- feeling for liu mei which would have send -PRON- into the pit -PRON- 
i rang for ffie elevator again 
i crawl into -PRON- wonder what sort of hell would breathe -PRON- brimstone into -PRON- this time and go back to the fifth floor 
the door to the apartment of liu ti be open 
i cross the threshold -PRON- terror mount 
there be nobody here but liu ti and what i may have say to -PRON- would never now be say 
-PRON- be dead 
-PRON- hang by a silken cord from a beam of -PRON- living room 
-PRON- face be a mask of horror 
-PRON- bulge eye stare right at -PRON- as though -PRON- say by the bond which exist between yovr father and -PRON- gordon bais i command -PRON- to stand by -PRON- niece and -PRON- betrothed until the end 
tiny shoe carefully and reverently i cut the cord which hang liu ti to the beam and lower -PRON- to the floor 
i have close the outer door 
then i now go systematically through all the room 
not another soul be in the place living or dead 
yet -PRON- have have a sister here a wife and a brother 
now all be go 
and by be -PRON- father son be a part of this family 
i have be spare i know because i be not chinese 
but if i do not refrain from meddle -PRON- recent captor have say and have provtti by -PRON- manhandle -PRON- white blood would not save -PRON- from -PRON- sinister design 
right now i could have swear score of eye be watch -PRON- study -PRON- wait the family of liu ti be go 
-PRON- at least would never know if i go out this very minute into the street and leave chinatown never to return 
what have i to do with the chinese 
maybe in the final analysis i love that part of liu a mei which be of -PRON- own race 
maybe i be blind by -PRON- love of oiina where i have spend so many year 
maybe wlien -PRON- own pecle look upon love between the race with revclsion -PRON- be rht 
maybe well if i go away now i be safe 
-PRON- have safd so 
if i ste the beating i have take would be horribly littfe compare to what y could do to -PRON- 
but lla father have be white and ray own father friend i know what -PRON- dad if -PRON- have be iivlog would have do 
and know what -PRON- own heart dictate 
i stoop over liu ti then aad whir -PRON- wonot get away with -PRON- i say while hp couldnot hear -PRON- of course or could -PRON- 
-PRON- face didnot diaie expreon but somehow i know th -PRON- knewhhad perhaps know from the begimiang belb the love between mei and -PRON- xvas the sort of thft whidi ndgbl devefbp between a boy and girt vdio rear ttether have never be allow to know what the outside wortd of what -PRON- cruelly cafie mfcce love 
-PRON- be just that nothing more 
to -PRON- -PRON- be a chinese and the sooner i forget about -PRON- the well 
but even as these traitorous thought go through -PRON- brain like black flash i seem to see liu mei stand befon -PRON- -PRON- eye calm fill with the bnowkdge of the age as th stare into -PRON- and say tt isnot like -PRON- gordon and -PRON- wasnot 
why should human being draw back from one another because of race or color or relon 
i know then that nothing ever change -PRON- not even when the time come as -PRON- would when i would be put to torture for -PRON- meddling 
without a backward glance i hurry from the room of liu ti and into the hallway i have last traverse with liu mei 
somewhere between the fourth ftooi and the first i tell -PRON- the strange thing happen i must find which floor ril start with the fourth 
for -PRON- be there that liu mei afraid of be spy upon have turn out the ligjit 
i go down in the devator 
-PRON- please -PRON- to defy the enemy tn thfs much at least 
i stipe at the fourth floor and get out shut the door behind -PRON- 
i be in another hallway brilliantly itghte 
i begin to move along -PRON- -PRON- eye study every inch of space 
i have the feeling that somehow liu mei woidd drop something dial would let -PRON- know that would point the way to the place i may find -PRON- 
but there be i go back to the elevator 
i hadnot see a soul and the echo of -PRON- own footfall have take on sinister meaning in the deserted hallway 
-PRON- seem to be shout to -PRON- to go bsrck to run fo cease try to pry into the dark secret of chinatown 
i start to open the elevator door but -PRON- would not open 
-PRON- heart stop for a moment 
since i have leave the cage some one have signal for -PRON- and -PRON- have or up 
viciously i jab the button and lieard the whirring of the cage from below 
there be something horrible in that whirring 
what would i see when i open the door of the cage 
who have signal -PRON- have that one know what i be do 
es watch -PRON- now i loiew -PRON- 
-PRON- would watch -PRON- as long as i be in qimatown and wherever i go out of qiinatown until the tortuous chinese mind be satisfied that the affair of liu ti and kwan tao and liu mei have be settle accordhig to the rdenttess chinese code 
the cage stop at -PRON- floor 
i yank open the door 
i donot know what i expect to find certainly not what i do find liu san brother of liu ti stand in a corner of the cage rigidly erect -PRON- black eye stare into mine 
there be the haft of a knife stick out of -PRON- left breast 
-PRON- right hand be clutch about the haft 
cold chill race along -PRON- spine 
-PRON- be dead 
-PRON- have to be dead with the knife in -PRON- like that 
but why do -PRON- stand upright and why be -PRON- in the cage now when -PRON- have be empty the last time i have see -PRON- 
or have -PRON- 
the last three word be almost a cry of terror 
have -PRON- be there with -PRON- during -PRON- recent descent from the fifth floor to the fourth 
if -PRON- have i hadnot know -PRON- 3ret i know -PRON- be possible 
i would have scream but know -PRON- useless 
a hundred murder could have be commit here and none outside the wiser as long as the victim be chinese 
a white man disappearing would be seek 
i step into the cage which quiver a little and touch the body of liu san 
instantly -PRON- topple sidewise crash stiffly to the floor 
the corpse be already rigid 
have this body be send to -PRON- as a warning 
i didnot know but i do know that some one listen many some one and watch 
i shout know that -PRON- word go ring up and down the shaft and out through the grill at all five floor so help -PRON- god bring every one responsible for this to justice and slay -PRON- with -PRON- bare hand if any harm come to liu mei 
of course -PRON- be foolish 
no sooner have i shout the echo ring all through the empty building than i know just how foolish -PRON- be 
on the hallway of the floor above -PRON- i could hear the scuffling of sandale foot 
on the floor below i could hear -PRON- too 
all through the building 
i slam the door drop down to the next floor 
and this time i leave the door open so that only by cwne to this floor could any one use the elevator 
and be in the hallway where i could see whoever approach 
i be fight mad and more frightened than i have ever be for liu mei mostly i tell -PRON- and didnot fool -PRON- at all 
i remember the kiss and caress of chinese knife and know that i would feel -PRON- again 
liu mei perhaps be feel -PRON- now i i search this hallway too and find nothing 
then i go back to the elevator 
no one have approach -PRON- for repeatedly i have look back to make sure 
i start to step into the cage 
the body of liu san have vanish 
in -PRON- place repose the dead body of liu sister around -PRON- neck the mate of the cord which have strangle liu ti the elevator have become an instrument of hellish black magic 
two people have be slay in -PRON- within the last fifteen minute or slay elsewhere and dump into -PRON- for -PRON- to find by some mean i couldnot even guess at 
i be like an automaton gear to run a certain distance in a straight line 
i couldnot wouldnot turn back or change -PRON- course in one iota come hell or high water 
i drop down to the second floor still seek the trail of liu mei 
this have to be the last floor for i have come to on the first floor to find liu mei miss 
i step fearfully over the supine body of liu sister into the hallway 
and almost at once like eye of cat blink in the dark i see the shoe 
-PRON- be a tiny shoe and i recognize -PRON- at once 
one of liu set with the brilliant that peep forth so alluringly from under the hem of -PRON- gown when -PRON- walk 
-PRON- seem to call to -PRON- beseechingly 
-PRON- seem to plead 
a -PRON- seem to threaten to challenge -PRON- 
-PRON- take all of -PRON- courage to walk down the hallway to that single shoe to stare down at -PRON- 
-PRON- rest on -PRON- side at the top of a flight of stair 
-PRON- be liu shoe without a doubt 
-PRON- have kick -PRON- off for -PRON- to find or have -PRON- 
maybe -PRON- captor have leave -PRON- there to lead -PRON- to destruction 
what would happen to -PRON- if i pick -PRON- up and go with -PRON- down the stair 
those stair strangely be ominously black fill with ebon foreboding of disaster to come 
the whole building seem to have fall silent to listen to what 
to the beating of -PRON- own terrified heart 
i wouldnot take the black stair 
-PRON- lead down to the first floor take the elevator stubbornly as i have take -PRON- hitherto 
this time i expect to find that some other horror have develop in -PRON- absence 
but no 
the door of the cage be still open and the sister of liu ti still sprawl supine on the floor 
i start to shut the door when the cry come shrill pierce fill with agony and with terror 
gordon 
gordon bais the cry come from the depth of that black stairwell whence step lead down into god know what 
that -PRON- have be the voice of liu mei i know for a certainty as i race for the stair 
and scarcely have the echo of -PRON- footfall start in the liallway again than -PRON- come once more with something add gordon i go back go back fol and there -PRON- break short off and i know that a hand have close tightly over -PRON- mouth z dirty hand a grimy chinese hand like the hand which have beat -PRON- smelly hand hand which -PRON- be sacrile to use upon the person of liu md 
if i could get -PRON- hand on the fellow who have stop -PRON- even for touch -PRON- i would tear -PRON- heart out with steely finr ger 
i didnot realize -PRON- have warn -PRON- back until i have plunge headlong into the black stairwell to be swallow by a darkness redolent with the odor of incense and liu perfume 
i see -PRON- then vanish into the hallway on the first floor around the comer of the stairwell below carry backward upright in the big arm of two huge man whose face i could not see but which i know be devilmaske 
something strike -PRON- at the base of the skull and i roll down the rest of the stair numb from the blow but know as i roll that -PRON- attacker be right behind come to strike -PRON- in 
i hit the bottom and fight for the strength to meet -PRON- when -PRON- reach -PRON- 
where be uu mei body as i drag stubbomly to -PRON- foot seem to be make of lead 
-PRON- arm be burden -PRON- leg be almost too heavy to drag under -PRON- 
-PRON- neck be stiff almost immovable as i twist -PRON- by great effort of will to face the man who come down tlie stair behind -PRON- 
a chinese of course and a huge one wear a devil mask 
i couldnot have handle -PRON- man for man have i be in full possession of -PRON- faculty and -PRON- unarm 
as matter stand i be on -PRON- foot but out helpless and -PRON- carry a club in both hand 
-PRON- wear the queue most unusual in a modern chinese and -PRON- look like a snake above -PRON- mask 
-PRON- tooth be show in a snarl or a grimace of murderous amusement 
-PRON- be like something out of a nightmare 
i raise -PRON- hand or try to to ward off the blow -PRON- be send at -PRON- but -PRON- tend wouldnot move and the blow land 
-PRON- land with a dull sound as though -PRON- have strike the head of a drum and i scarcely feel -PRON- at all 
that one thing tell -PRON- how close i be to death 
-PRON- have bring the chib down whh both hand 
i have try to pull -PRON- head out of the way 
i think the blow be a glance one 
-PRON- must have be else -PRON- would have drive -PRON- head down into -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- come at -PRON- strike again 
-PRON- right shoulder well i think -PRON- be almost break by that first blow 
i have no defense whatever except -PRON- wit 
and a certain knowledge of cantonese 
now i use the latter knowledge and hear singsong word burble madly through -PRON- lip lip that feel diick as untanned leather figure of the chinese dance before -PRON- eye until there seem to te two of -PRON- as i oke the word must get to liu mei 
-PRON- have do nothing 
what w31 -PRON- do to -PRON- -PRON- answer be so strange that for a long moment i do not understand -PRON- 
-PRON- know the ancient cantonese custom of the break urn 
um 
i repeat 
what have liu mei to do with urn 
this -PRON- answer fall back a little because i have manage to lift -PRON- left foot against -PRON- to keep -PRON- from get too close 
that a chinese husband expect -PRON- wife ft come to -PRON- as forgner call -PRON- idean 
if -PRON- find -PRON- be not so -PRON- end -PRON- back to -PRON- fafter on a rattle cart a broken urn swinging below a broken urn surround by bit of metal that dink the -PRON- drive most of the numbness out of -PRON- then and there 
i love the chinese always have the bad whh the good but have never be able to thifdc of thdr heartlessness to woman without a shudder of revulsion 
but lilt hei can not thus be send back 
again that horrible rattle in -PRON- throat which i could scarcely reccize as -PRON- own voice speak cantonese 
there be no finer more suitable woman anywhere 
that be true -PRON- say at the moment 
but when -PRON- have finish whh -PRON- -PRON- leave -PRON- there and i know the full meaning of -PRON- horrible fangshowing grimace 
uu mei be to be give to these monster 
-PRON- be be take away to that fate even as -PRON- speak 
kwan tao be a chinese could no more have take -PRON- to wife than -PRON- could have deny -PRON- belief in god and devil on the river of -PRON- native land 
-PRON- wasnot the first time a fragile delicate chinese woman have be give to a mob 
and here be numb with hurt unable to stop this imspealable and liu mei already go 
nothing have happen to -PRON- so far only because -PRON- captor must first make sure of -PRON- 
-PRON- have no desire for foreign police to break in ou -PRON- 
i cry out in agony 
i be a desperate savage man at that moment who couldnot be hurt any more 
whether i love liu mei or not have go to help -PRON- because -PRON- be a woman and lier captor bloodmad brute 
-PRON- desperation lend power to -PRON- band -PRON- foot 
i lunge at -PRON- attacker with -PRON- head down like a footbfdl player smash the line 
again -PRON- club crash down on -PRON- 
this time i take most of the trific blow m -PRON- shoulderbbde but almost intolerable pain shoot through -PRON- entire body then -PRON- head crash into the man stomach 
-PRON- be tdcen by surprise by a form of attack new to -PRON- and go violently backward to the floor strike -PRON- head with a sicken thud 
the club roll from -PRON- hand 
i see -PRON- and resolve tliat whatever happen to liu mei none of -PRON- wotdd be because of this man at -PRON- foot 
a i pick up the dub 
i remember the blow which have crash against -PRON- skull 
i must have be mad a beast in -PRON- own right 
with all -PRON- power i smash the club down on -PRON- head just as -PRON- lift -PRON- from the floor 
as -PRON- strike the top of -PRON- skull i feel the club sink in or the wood give and -PRON- head drop back soddenly upon the floor 
something red and sinuous like a crimson snake creep out from -PRON- mask sluggislily crawl 
still with the dub in -PRON- hand i whirl and run sluggishly along the way those two have go with liu mei i scarcely realize that the blood from -PRON- own wound be stream down -PRON- cheek until i taste -PRON- salt on -PRON- lip 
another flight of stair lead down into darkness 
i didnot hesitate down those stair and from that moment on what happen be a kind of blur 
there be mask man on the stair and i strike at -PRON- savagely with all -PRON- power 
i feel the club crack against skull cheek against body 
i ram the end of -PRON- into belly but i allow none of this to stay -PRON- headlong plunge down those stair 
-PRON- be dark that basement where i strike the bottom of the stair but far ahead of -PRON- i see a faint glow of light and i know that i be somewhere in the labyrinth under chinatown that maze of tunnel and passageway which no white man ever see 
there be man behind -PRON- but -PRON- fear -PRON- bloody swinging club 
besides i be mouth weird cry which sound insane even to -PRON- and chinese have dread respect for the insane 
know this the inspiration come to pretend insanity to keep -PRON- up until the last 
if -PRON- would realize that insane or not aim directly at the freeing of liu mei -PRON- would know i be not mad but if i act fast enough -PRON- wouldnot have time to think 
i come to that glow of fight -PRON- be a tunnel mouth and in the tunnel i dash to the first turnii 
even here i could see that -PRON- lead to another basement and a vast room outfit with gaudy lavishness 
the room be fill with coolie score of -PRON- stand face -PRON- master with become servility mask head bow 
there be one man on a dais a man in gorgeous robe with a black cap on -PRON- head top by a red coral button 
-PRON- wear the fivestrand beard of venerable wisdom and there be no smile on -PRON- lip nor mask upon -PRON- face 
bind gag fasten to a column which uphold the roof stand kwan tao 
-PRON- be struggle with hie bond 
-PRON- eye be shoot flame 
i stare at -PRON- as i run 
-PRON- be naked to the waist and -PRON- torso be a mass of blood 
kwan tao have be beat with the bamboo until -PRON- skin and flesh have be shred 
-PRON- chest be crimson and dripping and horrible 
-PRON- make -PRON- think of the ghastly death of a thousand cut but i know kwan tao wasnot thinking of those wound those ghastly wound which would have kill a white man 
stand between two coolie before the man on the dais be liu mei 
-PRON- face be deadly white but -PRON- stand proudly erect like a soldier 
i see the lip of the man on the dais and -PRON- be move but what the man say i couldnot make out 
yet i be close enough to have hear 
i see the lip of liu mei move in answer 
i see -PRON- head throw back as though -PRON- fling defiance into the face of the seated man 
-PRON- face be twist into bestial line as -PRON- listen 
but why couldnot i hear what be be say have something happen to -PRON- sense as ihe result of the beating i have take the whole thing be utterly weird 
-PRON- be tiice watch a silent motion picture and hear not even the machine which run -PRON- 
yet all of these people be alive unless i be look into a vart mirror which seem impossible 
the man on the dais suddenly rise shoot out -PRON- hand and slap liu mei twice once on either side of the face so hard that i think -PRON- head would be knodd from -PRON- shouidet i know that e for i could see -PRON- moutii open but i teard no sound 
the chinese master stand there in -PRON- wrath and i know that -PRON- heap that wrath upon this woman who defy win 
-PRON- uncle -PRON- sister mid god know who rfse have already pay the penalty for something 
i have see two a sister and a brother of liu ti and know some of the answer 
when any chinese tribunal sentence a man to death -PRON- whole family dial with -PRON- for what good do -PRON- do destroy the tiger mid spare die cute 
only kwaa tao -PRON- have spare for the moment at least kit in the end lie would go the same way 
just now tliougli -PRON- wish hhn to know to the full the huntihation to be visit upon liu mei the mt terrible feeling as i hurl ojyseif toward this ghastly tableau that i be a man in a nightmare with i love in dangw and -PRON- own foot root to the ground so that i could not move while death raixd upon -PRON- from the rear 
-PRON- be like swim in glue forward march because of -PRON- weakness 
-PRON- foot dramme against the tunnel floor but seem to talce -PRON- forward not at all 
-PRON- club be altnost too heavy to hold 
i have to clutch -PRON- with all the strength of -PRON- two hand 
i wonder if lm mei didnot know i be here try -PRON- good to get to -PRON- if only that i may ay -PRON- -PRON- to save -PRON- from what the monster would do to -PRON- 
do -PRON- guess 
as tiiough in answer to -PRON- thought -PRON- turn and look dired1y at -PRON- 
i think -PRON- right hand lift palm toward -PRON- as though -PRON- would order -PRON- to get back to save -PRON- 
but -PRON- couldnot possibly liave see -PRON- 
i know that instantly and yet in some strange fashion -PRON- must have know i be there try -PRON- good to reach -PRON- 
i whirl 
there where hideously mask face all around -PRON- 
qiinese block -PRON- retreat have i wish to retreat -PRON- didnot offer to touch -PRON- again 
-PRON- merely laugh horrible cackling laughter which shodc -PRON- body witli -PRON- glee and -PRON- be laugh at -PRON- 
i whirl burl -PRON- forward again 
i strike something an invisible mysterious something in fidl stride and -PRON- knock mo flat on -PRON- back stun -PRON- again 
i almost lose -PRON- and all around -PRON- -PRON- laugh and chatter 
i scramble to -PRON- foot feel in the air for whatever -PRON- be that have knock -PRON- down 
-PRON- hand come in terrify with an expanse of spotlessly clean glass of such dimension that -PRON- sliut -PRON- in the tunnel entirely yet let -PRON- see the hwror of tbe room bond tiling be make plain to -PRON- in that one agonizing moment 
i know or guess sometiiing of what must have happen 
come down in the elevator liu mei and i have pass a floor just after some sort of drug hide in the odor of meense perhaps have a be blow through the grill 
-PRON- have instantly render both of iis inanimate 
the cage have automatically stop at the ground floor where i have be take out 
then the enemy on the other floor have press the signal and the cage have go back up bearing liu mei helpless unconscious of what be happen to -PRON- into the hand of -PRON- enemy 
i have awaken in the cage again and have be beat horribly because i be too numb and stupid from the drug to fight back 
why have the chinese go about -PRON- work in so elaborate a fashion when a single knife thrust would have do for -PRON- and leave liu mei in -PRON- hand 
there seem at the moment just one explanation the one i have give -PRON- 
-PRON- play with -PRON- to keep -PRON- from go out and bring the white police 
and -PRON- didnot kill -PRON- solely because -PRON- know for sure that i hadnot tell police to come look for -PRON- if i didnot reappear in a certain length of time 
and this glass in the tunnel shut -PRON- off from the room beyond 
i could imagine why -PRON- be there 
not for -PRON- personal and special confounding but so that enemy of this imholy group or people who doubt -PRON- power may see what the monster be capable of do 
i couldnot go forward 
the tunnel behind -PRON- be pack with chinese 
knowledge of -PRON- plight drive -PRON- mad 
in a few moment something terrible would happen to liu mei 
i have to reach -PRON- 
i think desperation must have give -PRON- the strength of many man 
i step back from that expanse of glass 
i feel -PRON- bicep bulge 
power unimaginable power seem to swell and distend -PRON- every nerve and muscle 
the world whirl 
the tunnel spin 
i hurl -PRON- at that glass 
i didnot feel -PRON- hurt 
-PRON- be as though -PRON- anger have nullify -PRON- agony 
sweat drip from -PRON- the salty sweat of a corner brute beast 
-PRON- chib crash against that glass with all the power i have 
as -PRON- do every face and every mask in the room beyond be turn toward -PRON- 
liu mei turn and -PRON- hand go to -PRON- mouth 
-PRON- eye be big with terror 
a great jagged star show in the glass 
i feel someone hurl -PRON- at -PRON- from behind 
i spin swung instinctively lift -PRON- aim a little and crash -PRON- stick in the man mouth 
-PRON- must have knock out every tooth -PRON- head 
-PRON- turn a back somersault into the press behind -PRON- 
but i didnot even wait to see -PRON- strike among -PRON- fellow 
i whirl back to the glass again seize the split second leave before the enemy behind overpower -PRON- 
the first crash of -PRON- bludgeon against the glass have sound like the crack of doom 
the second be even bad for sliver of glass break free and clatter into the tunnel in jagged shard while other fall in the rown beyond 
berserk now unstoppable desperate with terror i swing and swing again 
i smash through 
the opening be small but i step back and hurl -PRON- through -PRON- just the same 
jag point like a thousand sword strike -PRON- catch at -PRON- clothing rip -PRON- flesh i be sob and curse 
i would reach liu mei 
i would free kwan tao to -PRON- knee beyond the glass turn a little to see the small chinese come through the glass after -PRON- 
i pause just a moment to crack down on the skull of the first two 
i do not spare -PRON- strength and there be other spfaffer of crimson on the glass when i again swing back to the occupimts of that hateful room 
-PRON- enemy in the tunnel aghast that one man could be so murderously destructive and draw back 
i could hear the voice of die man in the room i have so violently and madly enter 
the man on the dais sdze the rl take -PRON- to the room beyond 
half the coolie with -PRON- the other half here to slay this meddler f the coolie divide as though -PRON- have alreaffy be instruct 
kwan tao a bleed iwrror tug witliout cessation at -PRON- fiond 
the man on the dais scarcely move nor do the expression on -PRON- face change jump between the girl and -PRON- 
through -PRON- rank i see the other bear the girt to the other room 
i have no trouble guse what woufd happen there 
but no damn coolie could keep -PRON- from reach -PRON- 
i swing into that first group with all njy desperate ftrry 
one go down with a smashed tll 
i hear the man on the dais the first man to break ground before i bid -PRON- die by -PRON- hand 
i snap a glance over -PRON- right shoulder 
the man on the dais grip a snubnose automatic in -PRON- rit hand 
anotli chinese vtut down 
desperation drive the other coolie as -PRON- stand shoulder to shoulder to fight -PRON- off 
there be more ame through the glass behind -PRON- i know 
but i didnot take time to turn 
i sweep die heavy end of that club along the face of -PRON- enemy not to land solidly but to graze ant maim and smash 
the effect be horrible the now bloody mask askew 
-PRON- be like run the end of a stick along a picket fence save that tire result be bloody horror 
and i cry out all the tfme 
i see the door beyond -PRON- open 
liu mei cast one despairing look over -PRON- shoulder at -PRON- as the coolie bear -PRON- into that room out of which a faint light come 
then -PRON- be go and die smiridng coolie with -PRON- and hell have never spawn a fury such as i become 
i swing again and miss completely 
and this be the reason 
the man on the dais have say enough 
let -PRON- try to reach irer now 
-PRON- be too iate gordon bais 
by the time -PRON- could rip down tliat door -PRON- have to finish -PRON- 
i hurl -PRON- toward the door but -PRON- mind be not on tliat objective 
-PRON- hold a picture of the automatic grip on the knee of the master of all this horror 
i couldnot reach -PRON- 
bullet woirid travel too fast 
-PRON- eye would be follow every move i now make 
i have -PRON- location fast fix in -PRON- mind 
i must make no slight error of judgment 
and i do not 
almost at the door i whirl like a dervish and the bluntended club speed from -PRON- hand with -PRON- power and with all the skill that sometimes come to a man in a desperate place 
-PRON- go like a shot directly for the chest of the man on the dais 
-PRON- open to scream 
but the sound never get out 
-PRON- right hand italf swing toward -PRON- but -PRON- didnot have time to pull the trigger 
the bhint dub strike -PRON- in the dh and bone and cartdage must have give back before the hurtling projectile 
the man topple badeward from -PRON- dais 
i be right behind -PRON- strange weapon of offense while the slow thinker almost incapable of execute anytititig without the command of some superior stare at -PRON- like so many yellow statue 
only -PRON- es move 
i grasp the unconscious tealer by the throat yank -PRON- to fiis foot 
a i shake -PRON- 
i have to bring -PRON- to 
i grab at -PRON- automatic hold -PRON- in -PRON- right hand so that -PRON- muazle menace the wall of coolie who now surround -PRON- 
make one move against -PRON- i say hoarsely and twist this man head from -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- know i mean -PRON- and this man be -PRON- rice -PRON- live -PRON- master 
no move be make by any one 
the man be come around 
where be the key to that room 
i demand 
if i donot get -PRON- still kill this monster 
nobody speak 
the unconscious man couldnot 
kwan tao still with -PRON- bond 
i snap at the near coolie in whose belt be a knife 
loose -PRON- gag 
cut -PRON- bond have ever obey a mas ter more quickly 
kwan tao step free 
-PRON- face -PRON- whole body have be so harshly torture that -PRON- be next to impossible to recognize -PRON- 
where be the key kwan tao 
i demand 
on -PRON- left wrist hide under the sleeve 
i find -PRON- fasten by a thong 
i yank -PRON- free break the thong but only after -PRON- have cut deeply into the man flesh 
i drag -PRON- to the door 
i command kwan tao to hold -PRON- there 
if anything have happen to -PRON- i say this man will wish to god -PRON- have never be bear 
kwan tao didnot answer -PRON- 
-PRON- merely stare 
-PRON- lip work spasmodically 
-PRON- face be a gargoylesque red mask 
take this gat i snap again and see that the coolie donot follow -PRON- into the room 
i twist the key in the lock 
the door protestingly 
from inside -PRON- drive -PRON- to madness come sound which be like a woman moan of terror 
then word in shrill cantonese in liu voice turtle son of turtle egg of turtle how dare -PRON- lay hand on a daughter of king 
and one voice make answer daughter of king true but damn to eternity by mingle with the blood of a barbarian 
even -PRON- ancestor would say that what befall -PRON- will be less than -PRON- deserve 
then i be inside with kwan tao beside -PRON- drag the man i have all but slain 
and what a tableau meet -PRON- eye 
liu mei back against a far wall much of -PRON- upper garment tom away 
-PRON- head be back -PRON- shoulder be stiff with pride 
-PRON- right hand hold a knife poise -PRON- point aim at -PRON- own heart 
the mask coolie be close on -PRON- in a tight semicircle like hyena to the kill 
drop -PRON- liu mei snap some one 
out -PRON- cur back with -PRON- own the crimson kwan tao be the spokesman 
liu mei drop the knife 
the chinese slunk past -PRON- like beat mongrel 
kwan tao while relief begin to surge through -PRON- shut the door lock -PRON- put -PRON- back against ft 
kwan tao grin a savage red grin 
the man -PRON- have drag in with -PRON- have vanish 
maybe -PRON- have be play dead 
maybe well the fact remain that between the second kwan tao shove -PRON- against the wall and close the door the man have snap into consciousness and have slip out behind kwan tao 
kwan tao hadnot close the door 
-PRON- have be close from outside and all three of -PRON- be prisoner 
-PRON- bimgle -PRON- say kwan tao but maybe -PRON- be just as well 
-PRON- stare at liu as i do 
hef face never be whiter 
-PRON- have plainly be through hell i want to ask -PRON- what have happen 
chinese be to -PRON- brutally frank 
kwan tao ask -PRON- before i could those coolie do -PRON- have coolie ever in all -PRON- history ask liu mei bitterly fail to take of woman captive 
-PRON- didnot mince word 
i see the fece of kwan tao change as no torture have ever be able to make -PRON- change 
no chinese of -PRON- station cotdd possibly ignore the law of the broken nfn 
i break in on tlie grim thing that have come between kwan tao and the woman both of -PRON- love 
will some one kindly tell -PRON- the meaning of all this will say kwan tao and i must hurry for -PRON- have little time 
little time 
i repeat 
yes for even now the snaky tendril of the yellow smoke come into this from the room of hell beyond 
the flowery language of the highbom chinese do not desert -PRON- even now i whirl and see the yellow snioke yellow tentacle of -PRON- come in through the keyhole make one think of an inept smoker try to blow ring 
i choke 
-PRON- already have -PRON- by the throat 
chineje blank watb say kwan tao speak very rapidly wish -PRON- to take liu mei in marriage 
i wish -PRON- too proud to have for wife the dauter of chinese king 
but the tong say no 
lhi ti the tong 
-PRON- thrtene -PRON- with death i liu ti persist in -PRON- defiance 
liu ti think -PRON- may help 
this be the result 
and now -PRON- two good friend here -PRON- be altogether with but a few minute of life leave to -PRON- 
-PRON- didnot go toward liu mei 
i know that century of tradition hold -PRON- apart from -PRON- 
modern america would have ride in -PRON- youth over any such barrier as convention have rear between these two especially when the fault be not with liu mei 
kwan tao speak to -PRON- love -PRON- from the bottom of -PRON- heart liu ti know 
-PRON- voice be harsh 
but if -PRON- be to escape from this pit -PRON- would never again so much as touch -PRON- hand 
-PRON- didnot nod -PRON- couldnot 
-PRON- didnot shake -PRON- head 
there be no answer -PRON- could give because liu mei have already give -PRON- love -PRON- too liu mei have always love -PRON- i say 
one may as well speak truly on the brink of the grave where there be nothing to win or lose love rou both say liu mei speak as one already dead 
and now i die alone 
-PRON- be so unutterably lonely 
i didnot tell -PRON- even if there have be time what have befall -PRON- people 
-PRON- must have guess anythow 
-PRON- know -PRON- own kind 
i whirl on kwan tao 
go to -PRON- tao i choke 
take -PRON- in -PRON- arm 
what can -PRON- matter now when death be so close 
-PRON- look at -PRON- and do not move 
in the ear of -PRON- mind i could hear a creaky cart on the street of canton with a tinkling break urn swinging below -PRON- 
i could see liu mei white o face sit on that cart jeer at by multitude along the narrow muddy street 
the thought almost break -PRON- heart 
i start toward liu mei and couldnot make -PRON- 
-PRON- foot didnot work properly 
a i stagger almost fall away over to the right 
the wall be jump at -PRON- 
i couldnot lift -PRON- arm to ward -PRON- off 
-PRON- strike -PRON- in the face knock -PRON- flat 
i roll to -PRON- side look at kwan tao 
-PRON- be stare -PRON- face a mask of agony at liu mei 
but -PRON- hadnot take a step toward -PRON- 
now -PRON- sway like a tree in a hurricane as the drug which be slay all three of -PRON- get in -PRON- deadly work 
i get to -PRON- foot finally and -PRON- be like lift a mighty weight 
i slide against the wall try to shove -PRON- toward liu mei 
-PRON- be watch -PRON- and -PRON- eye thank -PRON- 
-PRON- must liave hew terrible to a delicately nurtured woman to die uke this with two man who know what a dreadful thing bad happen to -PRON- fina reach -PRON- 
i put n arm around -PRON- 
-PRON- be like tryir to lift an arm of lead 
i sag against hie wall 
a yellow film now between kwan tao and -PRON- through which -PRON- seem still to sway 
-PRON- eye be still fix on liu mei 
i think -PRON- be talk but there be a ringing in -PRON- ear so that i be none too sure 
daughter of king 
blood of king 
i tliougbt -PRON- be say 
defile by dreg from die rbtten gutter of chinatown 
how can turn to liu lei 
-PRON- wouldnot matter to -PRON- darle i whisper -PRON- whisper a sobbing kind of gasp know -PRON- help -PRON- 
i would tjdce -PRON- in -PRON- arm hold -PRON- forever and -PRON- would both forget 
-PRON- whispese back 
how good -PRON- be to know that gordon bais on the brink of the eastern heaven 
shb like kwan tko use the flowery speech in a crisis 
-PRON- be all chinese save that -PRON- coloring be almost as light as -PRON- own 
-PRON- to -PRON- be an american girl 
i try to hold -PRON- more tightly 
but both of -PRON- be sway and i be try to grip the smooth cold wall with the fingernail of -PRON- free liand 
i feel the nail slide along the stone i hear -PRON- like a thin screaming in -PRON- ear 
these weird impression tell -PRON- that hashish at least in part be in the yellow smoke which destroy -PRON- 
there be nothing ahead of -PRON- but death 
i turn to face liu mei 
maybe by slap -PRON- by shake -PRON- head i could keep -PRON- awake 
soon the enemy would open the door 
then perhaps i could hurl -PRON- out save -PRON- 
but god help -PRON- i couldnot manage -PRON- hand and arm 
all -PRON- strength could not lift -PRON- 
i couldnot even take -PRON- arm from about the proud graceful shoulder of liu mei be all three doom 
this be the end 
i sway 
-PRON- sway together and i tiunk liu mei hold -PRON- up once or twice when i would have fall 
-PRON- eye seem to bulge as i look at that lock door so that the thin tendril of yrilow smoke become as large fullbodied python yellow hideous nightmare python shove -PRON- coifs through a gargantuan keyhole to quest for the three of -PRON- 
i tile again to tell liu mei that -PRON- didnot matter 
but now no word would pass -PRON- lip 
-PRON- vocal cord would no longer serve -PRON- unaccountably i be down on the floor on -PRON- belly i couldnot rise again 
i couldnot wriggle -PRON- finger 
beside -PRON- liu mei be stand with -PRON- foot wide apart proudly try to die erect 
the yellow film be everywhere 
kwan tao still stand weave swaying look at liu mei 
-PRON- must have be look at -PRON- too 
but -PRON- prefer -PRON- i be sure of that 
-PRON- be something to take with -PRON- into the hereafter where -PRON- heaven would not cross and -PRON- should never meet again 
unless the white of liu mei come to -PRON- heaven 
how silly -PRON- be but the yellow smoke cause -PRON- 
and then -PRON- heart seem to stop beat for a moment 
i be lose liu mei 
perhaps i have never have -PRON- 
-PRON- love yes a strange kind of love but part of -PRON- life 
now the two of -PRON- kwan tao and liu mei stagger almost fall be move toward each other 
i see -PRON- meet 
-PRON- hand by some superhuman power which i do not share because i could not move -PRON- at all go out to -PRON- 
-PRON- catch -PRON- left arm draw the hand through -PRON- elbow 
-PRON- stand side by side with this strange chinese handclasp which be the signal of foregiveness of dose harmony of soul 
and then though both know american kiss because both have know the freedom of american school -PRON- be both all china 
-PRON- be rub -PRON- cheek together because the true chinese do not kiss 
-PRON- lock in each other arm 
then -PRON- fall as a tree fall and though i see -PRON- strike the hard floor i do not hear -PRON- because of the ghastly roar in -PRON- ear 
-PRON- fall sprawled supine but hold fast in each other arm and -PRON- spirit writhe in agony as -PRON- fall 
for i know that in those last minute both have forget there have ever be such a one as gordon bais take that awful strange agony with -PRON- into abysmal darkness where there be nothing but the roaring in -PRON- ear 
darkness through which shoot long tendril of yellow smoke engulf -PRON- consciousness in an elevator that be move 
strange and horrible and unearthly -PRON- seem 
-PRON- last memory liad be of kwan tao and liu mei fall side by side in the room of the yellow smoke forget all about -PRON- 
and here i be in a move elevator 
-PRON- hand be on the control 
the cage be drop 
save that liu mei be not here i may just have enter -PRON- with -PRON- 
but what hell there have be between -PRON- dazed drug wit begin to come back 
i note the pass floor 
i be drop from the third to the second 
i jam the control to stop the car at the ground floor 
i run out 
i be crazy i suppose but -PRON- couldnot end like this 
i have to find kwan tao and liu mei 
i scream 
i go race through the corridor down the stair head for the tunnel where miu lei kwan tao and i have suffer 
i smash headon against a wall where the door lead down have be 
there be nothing 
just a smooth wall with no sign that a stairway have ever exist here 
i bang against that panel shout 
i couldnot have break -PRON- down with a battering ram 
the echo of -PRON- cry and -PRON- pounding run eerily all through the bouse 
that be all 
no other soiwid 
wild with terror i race back to the elevator 
half an hour later i have scour that build from top to bottom and have find not fwie live soul 
nor a dead body 
and this at the last be the result of -PRON- madness i have find no trace of liu mei or kwan tao no hint that liu uncle a have ever even live here 
every trace of the thing which have happen here have vanish 
i find nothing 
i satisfy mysetf that i be alone in this place that have become a mausoleum of dreadful mystery 
i batter against that mystery and could find no answer 
i try to find way down into the warren and only cold blank panel meet -PRON- every attempt i be beatwi whip get officer dash to the outer door the only one in this place that wasnot lock 
i race out look along the street for police 
the door click shut and lock behind -PRON- 
i couldnot get back in 
i bang against that door i break -PRON- knndde 
i cry out liu name and kwan i sob with futile rage and despair 
this be i know the end 
nobody hi all chinatown throughout which -PRON- cry and battering must have be plaily hear give the slight sign until almost an hoftr of madness have pass 
then an old a very old chinese gentleman come to -PRON- look up and say -PRON- be futile for the foreigner to batter -PRON- head against the stone 
the dead must bury -PRON- dead 
the past be go 
nothing can be regain 
the task of the kving be to forget quickly 
in -PRON- place -PRON- young friend i should go back to -PRON- own 
for never again will -PRON- see any of -PRON- know so well no not even though -PRON- police tear chinatown into shred 
-PRON- take a long time to convince -PRON- but -PRON- do -PRON- finally and i go home staggering like a drunken man while finger of yellow mist seem eternally to be strike the lobe of -PRON- brain push -PRON- ainst the inside of -PRON- skull 
out of -PRON- all i think crazily the yellow smoke at least would be always with -PRON- ns 10c a copy out now wmamsr stobse ever toldi two fall heagib novel of eerio mrsterf itm by now on sale

before the first year be out -PRON- have see that joe be put in charge of furnace no and the only reason joe hadnot rise steadily from that time onward be due to no fault of -PRON- just happen that at the time there be no job open to there be a pause in the puddler boss upward progress that last almost two year

when tluit happen the man in tlie control cab have to walk out on tlie girder until -PRON- be directly over the huge vat of boil metal in order to reset the cutoff dog 
the mill do not have a night shift 
business be dull and seitz have no difficulty in avoid the nightwatchman when -PRON- come to put -PRON- jan into operation 
the plan be very simple 
all seitz do be to crawl out on the girder and grease -PRON- thoroughly at the spot that would be directly over the ladle the next time the dog slip
