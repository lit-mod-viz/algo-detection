part by victor by bob olsen by lowell howard morrow aviation questionnaire letter from -PRON- reader on the cover this month be illustrate the story by bob olsen 
here -PRON- see graphically one of the lofty air station several thousand foot up in the air keep aloft by the mysterious gravinul 
the huge flyer just approach the platform stop to take on passenger who have rise to the station from the city 
the passenger -PRON- wear the future fly suit and be propel by a by ed earl repp 
the world war have show that invisibility be not impossible 
-PRON- can be obtain in various manner such as by camouflage 
even now science have electrical or electromechanical mean to make -PRON- possible for an aviator to change the entire color of an airplane for war purpose so that -PRON- will merge with the sky 
thus from a distance of a few thousand foot -PRON- can no longer be see 
pretty soon airplane will be as noiseless as automobile and when that happen -PRON- will become a terrible menace particularly for war purpose fail to read this story where the author tackle and solve this problem in such an unusual way by henrik dahl juve 
of course -PRON- remember the silent destroyer by this author and now -PRON- have give -PRON- a sequel to -PRON- former story which in all respect match the first one and in other respect far eclipse -PRON- 
for sheer daring and audacity of new scientific reasoning this author stand alone by harl vincent 
-PRON- be concede by many that at low altitude say at foot -PRON- will be impossible to fly an airplane faster than about mile an hour if that fast 
the air resistance become so tremendous at such speed that the power necessary to operate the aircraft make the proposition uneconomic 
suppose that by some electrical mean -PRON- be possible to create a vacuum in which the airplane of the future will fly 
this be not an impossible thought and -PRON- may rest assure that this will come to pass 
the author propose an entirely new scientific thought in this story that be revolutionary 
-PRON- be one of the big idea that have ever be propose for aviation 
-PRON- simply must read this story by roman 
in introduce this new author to -PRON- evergrowe audience -PRON- be certain that -PRON- will applaud the new aviation thought embody in this story 
base upon excellent science -PRON- plane which travel mile in hour or mile an hour be neither preposterous nor impossible

editorial general office and advertising department park place new york city editorial advertising and general office park place new york the future of aviation spring from the imagination hugo gernsback literary editor art director associate aviation editor air corps reserve professor aeronautical engineering iowa state college head department mechanical and industrial engineering and professor of aeronautic university of kansa aero 
eng 
associate professor aeronautical engineering univ of detroit mil 
department of aeronautical engineering university of michigan dept 
mechanical engineering university of california these aeronautical expert pass upon the scientific principle of all story by next great development in the art of aviation will no doubt be the rocket flier 
every aviator hen know the limitation of the gasoline engine the disadvantage of the electric ignition system and the often unreliable propeller 
the weight of the gasoline engine with -PRON- ignition apparatus fuel and of the profiler system usually be as much as that of the rest of the airplane and for that reason engineer for a long time have be try to evolve something well 
-PRON- be true that experiment be now be make in all country to replace the present gasoline engine by mean of the diesel engine which require no electric ignition system neither do -PRON- use gasoline the fuel in this case be crude oil 
while combustion do take place the firing be not do by electrical mean the oil become ignite because of the high compression that the diesel engine cause 
while this be an advantage and do away with the oftenunreliable electriwl ignition system the development of diesel engine for airplane so far have not be very encouraging 
the wall of the cylinder for the diesel engine must be so thick in order to withstand the tremendous pressure that not much saving of weight be possible 
the next great development undoubtedly lie in the propose rocket airplane on which extensive experiment be now under way particularly in germany 
the rocket apparatus compare to the gasoline engine be a marvel of simplicity there be no move part and the weight of the engine be small because -PRON- consist only of tube 
as the name imply the rocket device be nothing more or less than a powerful rocket 
the firing be usually do by mean of a simple electrical apparatus and chemical mean could be devise if necessary 
the rocket principle be totally different from any other form of propulsion and any one who have ever see a firework rocket go into the air will understand that the rocket do not rely upon propeller or engine 
rather the underlie principle be motion impart to the rocket by reaction to the expulsion of highlycompresse gas 
-PRON- be a mistaken notion of some layman to suppose that a rocket work well only in the atmosphere the reverse be true 
the efficiency of the rocket be much well in a vacuum as demonstrate by the experiment of the anjerican physicist goddard of rocketprinciple fame 
recently in germany experiment in rocket propulsion be make by max valier who attach a number of electricallyfired rocket to an automobile 
the speed obtain from this automobile be great than that of any vehicle that travel on rail before 
the automobile in this experiment do not run on a dirt track but on steel rail and there be no human being inside the car the only occupant be a cat such excessive speed be develop that the rockrt automobile jump the track and wreck -PRON- incidentally kill the cat of course at present the rocket principle as apply to airplane be still in the early experimental stage 
no airplane have be build with rocket propulsion the reason be mainly that no very satisfactory rocket fuel have be develop 
the present fuel consist almost entirely of black powder which when ignite burn very rapidly and give a tremendous kick tend to move the rocket in the direction opposite to the motion of the exhaust gas 
engineer have become satisfied that rocket propulsion will form the basis of the airplane motor of the future 
-PRON- will not be long until a suitable and efficient fuel will be forthcome 
among one of the rocket fuel mention lately by german engineer be liquid oxygen the efficiency of which seem to be very much high than that of ordinary black powder 
fuel such as dynamite nitroglycerine have also be mention in the past but so far no means have be find to make -PRON- safe and to control the explosion in a desire degree 
this however nee not frighten -PRON- because only year ago if some one have mention that -PRON- could ride in a car that rely for -PRON- power upon gasoline that continuously explode -PRON- would have be most dubious about the sanity of any inventor propose such a scheme 
yet the automobile be a witness that the explosive engine have be in -PRON- way a success 
of course once a suitable and powerful rocket fuel have be develop as -PRON- probably will be within the next twentyfive year the problem of control the explosion from the different rocket to a nicety will be easily solve by rocketpropulsion engineer 
strange as -PRON- may seem -PRON- will then be possible to have an airplane that can hover about and practically stand still simply by fire the rocket engine at the desire rate 
-PRON- will thus just balance the force of gravity exactly as a motorist today can hold -PRON- car stationary on a hill by let -PRON- engine run and just get enough power from the engine to neutralize the force which tend to pull the car down the hill 
by member american physical society american association for the advancement of science contemplate the future commercial machine along strictly engineering line -PRON- should be guide by the past history of other endeavor in transportation 
the development of the steamship and of the automobile show -PRON- the way 
when -PRON- compare the first steamboat build by robert fulton and place -PRON- side by side with the leviathan -PRON- be astonish at the tremendous progress make 
there be a similar comparison between the first automobile and the modern auto bus and the same be true of the first locomotive as compare to the presentday monster 
history will repeat -PRON- in the same manner in airplane construction 
the plane which -PRON- have today will be consider very small and inefficient as in the light of the plane which -PRON- will have fifteen or twenty year hence 
in the illustration accompany this article i have endeavor to show some of the possible improvement base strictly upon aviation engineering principle as -PRON- no doubt will come about very soon 
for some of the suggestion embody in this article i be indebte to general william mitchell former director military aeronautic army 
the plane illustrate be allmetal and have a wingspread of about to foot -PRON- total length from propeller to tail be some foot 
the machine will probably weigh in the neighborhood of ton or slightly over 
accommodation for passenger will be contain entirely inside the metallic wing as show in the illustration 
in order to do away with air friction so far as possible the landing wheel be retract into the body of the machine the instant the airplane leave the ground 
when a landing be to be make the wheel be lower into landing position 
one of the great danger at the present time in fly at considerable height and particularly in fly over the ocean be from ice form on the wing and propeller 
this have be the reason for many accident and many plane have disappear into the ocean because of ice formation 
a way to overcome this rather easily be show in the illustration the use of electric heater instal within the wing 
the metallic wing can quickly be heat sufficiently to melt the form ice after which the electric current can be turn off 
the writer propose a novel scheme to keep off the dangerous ice from the propeller 
the 30foot allmetal propeller contain within -PRON- tube into which the exhaust from the engine can be direct whenever -PRON- become necessary 
this will heat the propeller sufficiently to keep ice from form 
during normal condition the exhaust can of course be divert in the usual manner 
the illustration show also a large gyroscope for stabilize the airplane 
this become necessary in all choppy weather and tend to keep the airplane on an even keel 
-PRON- use also become important when fly in a fog and will prevent the navigator from lose -PRON- orientation 
but for safety purpose the most important element of the airplane of the future be the multiple power plant 
to the writer mind the multipropeller airplane of the present day will not survive in the future 
the reason be that neither much safety nor anything else be gain by instal separate power plant with separate propeller for too much additional weight be necessitate thereby 
in the illustration be show a simple remedy and that be to use a single propeller attach to a single shaft to which shaft be couple a number of separate engine 
all these engine operate individually and let -PRON- say there be six engine two or more of -PRON- can go dead while the other will still give sufficient power to keep the plane aloft 
normally three engine be use while three be keep in reserve 
repair can be make on any three engine by the mechanic while the machine be in flight without slow down the airplane 
the engine as will be see from the illustration be accessible from all side and be of course also enclose in the inside of the low part of the airplane 
by the time this airplane will be build there will be many new device in use such as the alreadydevelope electriccondenser apparatus for land in a fog 
this arrangement by which a plane -PRON- become one plate of the condenser while the earth be the other plate accurately register upon an instrument in the navigation house the distance of the machine from the ground 
this of course be important while fly in a fog 
no doubt the airplane of the future will be equip with huge neon parabolic light in order to pierce the fog 
plane such as that picture here will be construct to cover great distance 
such plane will make trip from los angele to new york without stop while passenger may be take off or on by small helicopter plane alight on the back of the large machine as picture in the illustration 
gyroscope courtesy sperry gyroscope comiiany at a word from the leader -PRON- load the case into the rear of die plane hatch atop the albatross have be fasten and now there come loud thumping and shout from beneath one of these the most uneventful life there sometimes come a supreme adventure an experience of such breathtaking interest that -PRON- fully compensate for all the drabness that have go before 
to roger erskine in -PRON- midthirtie -PRON- seem that there be nothing that could happen to alter the humdrum routine of -PRON- existence 
but in this -PRON- reckon without the powerful hand of that intangible mistress of -PRON- destiny -PRON- call fate 
morning after morning for more than twelve year -PRON- have pass through the ornate entrance of the new yorkparis airway build at precisely five minute before nine oclock 
true -PRON- advancement with the great transatlantic airline have be steady and remunerative 
now in the position of vicepresident of engineer -PRON- yearly salary run close to six figure and -PRON- power and influence in the organization have become almost supreme 
but -PRON- be far from contented 
since the death of -PRON- father in erskine have spend five lonesome year though -PRON- maintain the park avenue apartment -PRON- have occupy together 
deeply immersed in -PRON- work -PRON- have little time in which to meditate on this lonesomeness or to cultivate outside acquaintance 
-PRON- be thus that -PRON- find time hang heavily on -PRON- hand when -PRON- objective have be reach and the more arduous of -PRON- duty shift to the shoulder of a staff of capable subordinate 
the new yorkparis airway incorporate in addition to the regular operation of -PRON- line engage in the manufacture and sale of the huge atrliner use in transoceanic travel 
-PRON- be in this branchy of the activity of -PRON- corporation that erskine specialize for year but now -PRON- duty extend to the maintenance and repair of all mechanism on board the maity liner in regular service as well as to the supervision of design and manufacturing 
but in this executive capacity -PRON- find somehow a lack of the intense interest that have be -PRON- urge during the year of struggle to reach the top of -PRON- choose profession 
and now less than a month after be instal in -PRON- new position -PRON- be inclined to consider the suggestion of john emory chairman of the board that a half year in europe would benefit -PRON- greatly and serve as a fitting preliminary to the actual taking over of -PRON- new responsibility 
roger -PRON- father old friend and adviser have warn -PRON- -PRON- have be work very hard ever since -PRON- leave college and have enjoy no recreation to speak of nor have -PRON- ever take a vacation 
-PRON- will become an old man before -PRON- time and will go stale on the job 
the company owe -PRON- to -PRON- and i want -PRON- to pack up -PRON- dud and wellknown author again come for ward with a most exciting as well as interesting scienceaviation fiction story 
as always this story illustrate the author knack of keep -PRON- interest at all time 
incidentally the excellent situation that -PRON- weave into the story never tax -PRON- credulity but somehow or other give the illusion that the story be true to life 
and -PRON- science be good 
this however be not surprising because the author have be an engineer to one of -PRON- wellknown electrical industrial corporation 
as such -PRON- have the necessary experience to know whereof -PRON- write and -PRON- never permit -PRON- to go into the of the purely fantastic play around europe for awhile say for six month at least 
roger have be take off -PRON- foot by the suggestion 
but mr emory -PRON- object no good for that sort of thing 
i must keep in the harness or i donot know what to do with -PRON- 
suit -PRON- the clmirman have reply but donot forget what i have tell -PRON- 
and if at any time -PRON- should change -PRON- mind -PRON- have full authority to go ahead and at the company expense 
these word come back to roger now and -PRON- drum the glass top of -PRON- large mahogany desk with nervous finger as -PRON- gaze abstractedly through the open window of -PRON- office 
be that all mr erskine inquire the soft voice of -PRON- secretary 
oh i beg pardon 
miss henderson -PRON- apologize with a sheepish laugh with -PRON- day dream again i completely forget what -PRON- be do 
let -PRON- see now where be -PRON- 
the efficient secretary soon set -PRON- straight and the work continue to the end 
but -PRON- interest have desert -PRON- completely when -PRON- have finish 
-PRON- be and spring be in the air 
by george -PRON- exclaim with sudden decision when little miss henderson have trip from the room go to make that trip 
paris vienna rome barcelona the riviera 
and i may as well start now before i get too deeply into this new job 
-PRON- thump -PRON- desk vigorously 
and that decision mark the beginning of adventure for roger erskine 
the albatross hour later the albatross one of the fast liner tug at -PRON- mooring mast like a spirited hound at the leash 
-PRON- lack a half hour of noon -PRON- scheduled sailing time and roger gaze with pardonable pride at the silvery length of the dirigible that swing majestically above -PRON- long island landing field nose cuddle to the mast yet strain to be away 
these giant ship be child of -PRON- brain -PRON- love -PRON- like child know -PRON- every caprice -PRON- fault as well as -PRON- virtue 
at the foot of the mast -PRON- be salute by captain anderson 
glad to see -PRON- mr erskine say the captain heartily 
and glad -PRON- be cross with -PRON- see -PRON- name on the passenger list this morning 
roger grin delightedly 
-PRON- have know anderson for a number of year and admire -PRON- greatly 
thank cap -PRON- reply 
glad to see -PRON- too 
much of a passenger list 
no 
less than seven hundred this trip 
but there s some notable aboard 
yes 
-PRON- bet 
half a dozen bank president and millionaire not to mention a couple of congressman and old baron von hofe and -PRON- new chorusgirl wife 
then besides there s professor ingall and -PRON- daughter 
ingall exclaim roger 
oh that s great want for a long while to meet -PRON- fix that as soon as -PRON- sail 
both of -PRON- be assign to -PRON- table so -PRON- will be easy 
but there s something mysterious about ingall mission abroad 
the reporter and cameraman have be hang around the field all morning try to get some dope on -PRON- but -PRON- wonot leave -PRON- cabin 
roger laugh typical of -PRON- from what hear -PRON- comment 
-PRON- must be quite a character 
-PRON- sure be be surprised when -PRON- meet -PRON- 
funny old duck but have a way of look at -PRON- that make -PRON- feel like a lowgrade moron arrival be crowd into the lift and roger and the captain join these in the swift ascent to the wait vessel 
when -PRON- emerge from the cage and enter the passageway of the albatross captain anderson pull roger aside while the other passenger file past on -PRON- way to the cabin on the four deck of the vessel 
come to the bridge with -PRON- -PRON- whisper like to show -PRON- how easily -PRON- handle with the new control that have just be instal 
willingly roger follow and soon find -PRON- in the midst of the central bridgecontrol mechanism with which -PRON- be so familiar 
the helmsman be already at the wheel and through the open window sweep the warm breeze from the ocean 
before -PRON- curve sharply upward there be the glisten low surface of the great metal cigar in which be safely imprison the gas that provide -PRON- buoyancy 
to the field nearly three hundred foot below stretch the latticework of the mooring mast sway gently with the movement of the giant liner tugging at -PRON- tip 
there come the long blast of a siren from below an answer blast from the albatross the clang of unloosed shackle forward 
slowly the mooring mast seem to drift away from the nose of the huge silvery cigar slowly the landing field rotate beneath -PRON- as the seemingly motionless ship be carry from -PRON- mooring by the playful breeze 
then at a touch of finger there come the throb of the twelve motor and roger know that a gale of wind be blow aft through the thousandfoot tunnel which perforate the axis of the huge cigar a gale that create the partial vacuum forward into which -PRON- would be draw with everincrease velocity 
the ship respond to the wheel and -PRON- quickly head across the wind and speed high above the dotted countryside of long island toward the sound 
anderson turn to roger with a smile 
pretty -PRON- ask 
perfect 
but how do the chief like -PRON- oh the engineer be all right 
-PRON- kick a bit at first but this bridge control get -PRON- all over the old telegraph system and -PRON- soon get wise to the fact that -PRON- save work for -PRON- too good 
at first -PRON- fear there would be trouble 
but -PRON- seem to be work out fine on all the ship 
sure 
no reason -PRON- shouldnot and now let get below and wash up a bit show -PRON- to -PRON- cabin 
-PRON- cross the promenade on -PRON- way to the low deck and roger thrill with a sense of freedom and something of anticipation as -PRON- note that the fishing boat off port jefferson be slip rapidly astern far beneath -PRON- 
professor ingall the eye of the casual observer the figure of professor warren ingall present little to attract the attention 
small of stature with bandied leg encase in trouser several size too large -PRON- gait be that of a slouching chimpanzee 
-PRON- stoop badly and -PRON- totally bald head hang from -PRON- shoulder at such an angle that one be impel to look for -PRON- eye in the vastness of that incredibly pink and shine pate 
and when -PRON- raise -PRON- head and peer from beneath -PRON- bushy russet brow the object of -PRON- gaze if of human mould be quite likely to quail beneath the pierce contemptuous fire that snap from the most remarkable pair of blueblack eye in existence 
but when -PRON- speak the soft gentility of -PRON- voice belie the warning of those eye while the authority of the word issue from the slightly twist lip bring instant attention 
roger erskine be thrill when -PRON- find -PRON- place at the captain table immediately adjacent to that of the great scientist 
-PRON- be slightly fluster at the disconcert stare from those remarkable eye when the professor gravely acknowledge the captain intro duction of -PRON- but -PRON- embarrassment heighten to near panic when -PRON- be present to the beautiful girl at the professor other hand 
-PRON- be -PRON- daughter and the most strikingly lovely girl roger bad ever see 
the hardworking young engineer have always shun the fair sex and -PRON- now find -PRON- utterly speechless in the presence of one of -PRON- fair representative 
but the next word of the professor set -PRON- somewhat more at ease 
be -PRON- the erskine of -PRON- ask am 
professor 
rather young for the position of responsibility -PRON- recently acquire arenot -PRON- the black eye twinkle with the question 
why possibly 
by ordinary standard 
but -PRON- see i have spend twelve year with the organization grow up with -PRON- in fact 
hm 
twelve year 
then -PRON- donot consider -PRON- advancement as anything out of the ordinary 
no sir 
that be not particularly 
in commercial aviation most of -PRON- be youngster -PRON- know true sigh the professor wistfully 
however some of -PRON- old fellow have give -PRON- many a boost too 
indeed yes replied roger thinking of the twelve oil engine of the albatross whose high thermal efficiency be make possible by one qf ingall invention 
and do -PRON- know the professor voice continue in a soft whisper have the most astounding improvement of all work out at the present moment 
-PRON- have ask roger excitedly 
what be -PRON- 
ingall look furtively around the table 
after dinner -PRON- whisper come to -PRON- suite and tell -PRON- all about -PRON- 
possibly -PRON- can help -PRON- too 
the thing be so far reach that dangerous alien finger be already stretch forth to steal -PRON- from -PRON- 
spy be everywhere 
roger look incredulous but -PRON- could not doubt the sincerity of the professor fear 
the savant bright eye have dull with a glaze of positive terror come professor -PRON- say gravely and thank -PRON- for the invitation the silvery voice of irene ingall prove a welcome relief 
father -PRON- reprove not talk shop with mr erskine be -PRON- 
the professor look up guiltily afraid i be -PRON- dear -PRON- admit 
well -PRON- must stop -PRON- at once -PRON- pout prettily 
and the smile -PRON- flash at roger cause -PRON- heart to skip a beat 
from there the talk shift into light channel and roger find -PRON- enjoy immensely the company of the professor and -PRON- charming daughter 
by the time the meal be finish -PRON- have completely forget the engagement with the father and when the three stroll from the dining room -PRON- propose a turn about the promenade deck 
-PRON- be about two hour out now and be fly low over cape cod bay approach provincetown 
there be scarcely a breeze and the deck be as steady beneath -PRON- foot as the solid ground 
the drone of the motor come pleasantly to -PRON- ear and the light of the sun reflect from the calm water below in dance diamond point of dazzle brilliance 
-PRON- be a peaceful and beautiful day and -PRON- seem that most of the passenger be on the promenade deck 
the professor seem lose in thought rarely interrupt the conversation carry on so fluently now by -PRON- daughter and roger 
-PRON- display little interest in -PRON- talk and appear nervous and irritable 
once when -PRON- pass a seat group of man -PRON- hesitate and peer intently at one whose eye be hide behind a pair of large blacklense goggle 
there be a little flurry amongst the passenger on the port side and a group gather about one of the large observation window 
when -PRON- join this group -PRON- find -PRON- watch the maneuvering of a large cabin plane that circle and bank in close proximity to the albatross 
-PRON- be a speedy monoplane and the roar of -PRON- single radial motor drown completely the purr of -PRON- own engine 
again and again -PRON- circle banking steeply as -PRON- draw closer to the great liner 
then the pilot cut -PRON- gun and glide swiftly toward -PRON- 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- must crash into the very window through which -PRON- watch spellbound 
then -PRON- dive sharply and cut underneath out of sight 
but in the brief instant of pass the plane have approach so closely that -PRON- plainly see a figure in one of the window signal with a handkerchief 
roger turn quickly at the sudden grip of a strong hand on -PRON- arm 
-PRON- be the professor and -PRON- point with -PRON- free hand to a crouch figure at an adjacent window 
look -PRON- say hoarsely 
the crouch man spring from -PRON- position and run with catlike agility for the near companionway tuck a white handkerchief into -PRON- pocket as -PRON- turn 
roger do not get a good look at -PRON- feature but from the fleeting glimpse -PRON- do obtain -PRON- feel sure that the man countenance be of decide oriental cast 
-PRON- signal the plane breathe the professor in explanation 
what do -PRON- mean ask roger puzzle 
irene ingall stand by suddenly whiteface 
the passenger talk excitedly of the stunting -PRON- have just witness 
-PRON- mean say the professor solemnly the enemy be on -PRON- trail 
-PRON- must advise the captain at once 
and then -PRON- boy like to have that talk with -PRON- 
a capture listen gravely to the professor account of the happening of the afternoon 
funny professor -PRON- say think -PRON- be mighty secretive about this trip and mighty anxious to get away without be see 
but i have no idea -PRON- be try to avoid some danger 
be -PRON- a question of evade a gang of racketeer or commercial spy who be after this invention of yours 
bad than that 
captain 
a great government be after the secret a government that have be wait watch plan for year a government that would plunge the world into a war of far great magnitude than the war of a war that may well mean the end of civilization 
anderson sit aghast at the professor earnestness as do roger 
but irene seem not to be surprised -PRON- be evidently in -PRON- father confidence 
chink do -PRON- say -PRON- be ask the captain 
not exactly reply the professor though many of the enemy be of the yellow race 
the government i speak of be a secret religious government that plan dominance of the world and with -PRON- discovery in -PRON- hand with the discoverer remove this would prove a simple matter 
this be a religious organization that have spring up unsuspected during the past fifteen year 
religious ask roger blankly exactly 
i chance upon the headquarters of -PRON- organization more than five year ago when i make that trip into mongolia and -PRON- have follow -PRON- and spy on -PRON- ever since 
but object the captain these heathen couldnot hope to carry out such a plan 
-PRON- havenot the money the intelligence nor the man power power exclaim the professor 
why man alive donot -PRON- know that more than thirty per cent of the population of the world be of the yellow race -PRON- know but -PRON- sentence remain unfinished for captain anderson hurl -PRON- from -PRON- chair and spring past the professor so suddenly as to knock -PRON- breathless into -PRON- chair 
roger turn in alarm at sound of a heavy impact and a smothered shriek behind -PRON- 
anderson have plunge through the open door and now hold in -PRON- great hairy paw a struggle slanteye individual who snarl and fight like a wild cat 
the captain fling -PRON- captive to the floor and bolt the door behind -PRON- 
irene draw back in distaste 
get -PRON- grunt the captain delightedly 
an hour of vigorous questioning fail to elicit any information from the prisoner 
not even with third degree method of such severity as to bring forth the disapproval of roger and the professor be the captain able to learn anything regard the confederate nor the mission of the inscrutable yellow man 
finally -PRON- give up in disgust and order the defiant spy carry below in iron 
irene have long since leave the captain quarter and roger soon follow the professor to deck and down a corridor to -PRON- suite 
irene look up from a novel when -PRON- enter 
-PRON- smile a wt wanly roger think 
kd the captain learn anything -PRON- ask 
nothing say -PRON- father spread -PRON- hand in a gesture of futility 
-PRON- be always this way 
the authority seem unable to help -PRON- -PRON- be absolutely powerless against this organization 
when one member be apprehend another take -PRON- place 
-PRON- have follow -PRON- even here 
there be more of -PRON- on board the girl pale perceptibly 
undoubtedly 
and all of -PRON- paraphernalia -PRON- entire secret be right here 
-PRON- be prepare a desperate effort to obtain -PRON- all at one stroke 
-PRON- point at several large ironbound trunk that occupi a corner of the large sitting room of the suite 
then -PRON- turn to roger speak rapidly 
the secret that would give -PRON- control of the world nay of the universe be in those innocent appear case 
fool that i be to think that i could escape -PRON- fool not to have place -PRON- apparatus and -PRON- daughter under the protection of -PRON- government at home instead of start on this harebrained attempt to hide in europe but the secret 
professor 
roger ask fire by the man intense conviction do not understand 
excuse -PRON- -PRON- boy apologize the energetic little man mop -PRON- brow 
please have a seat and explain ft all to -PRON- right now 
here a cigar 
the secret hand a long black stogie to roger and sink into a chair opposite the one -PRON- have indicate to -PRON- guest 
perhaps -PRON- consider -PRON- a madman -PRON- begin 
in fact i be in doubt as to -PRON- own sanity when i first stumble on the discovery these fiend be after 
but -PRON- be all there in those case indisputable proof that i can duplicate at any time 
the secret of the universe be there all the dream of the ancient alchemist come true the transmutation of element the annihilation of energy all be now possible 
-PRON- mean -PRON- mean -PRON- have learn how to disintegrate the atom precisely 
listen the albatross carry twelve engine of two thousand horsepower capacity 
for all -PRON- high efficiency -PRON- consume fourtenth of a pound of lowgrade oil per hour for each horsepower -PRON- turn out 
nearly one hundred and seventyfive ton of fuel be thus need to complete the thirtysixhour journey from new york to paris 
the engihe -PRON- for all -PRON- superior design weigh considerably more than a pound per horsepower rating another fifteen ton 
think of the payload sacrifice with atomic motor of less than a tenth of the weight of -PRON- modify diesel and with no fuel weight whatsoever the journey could be make in less time and at a cost of not more than ten dollar an hour for power a total fuel cost less than that of a single firstclass passage 
by a simple adaptation of -PRON- process nitrogen extract from the atmosphere as -PRON- progress could be use as fuel in the atomic motor the destruction of -PRON- atom in especially construct chamber provide the nearly free energy 
roger stare agape 
but can this be definitely control -PRON- ask 
absolutely 
and the derivation of power be but one of the use to which -PRON- discovery can be put 
that be where the danger lie if -PRON- fall into unscrupulous hand 
thp energy can be control from a distance 
battleship airplane whole city could be wipe out of existence in the twinkling of an eye and at the simple pressure of a button cosmic ray be the basis of the secret 
cosmic ray 
yes 
that be the result be accomplish by select -PRON- and after sort and redirect -PRON- put -PRON- to work 
to fully understand -PRON- must fix firmly in -PRON- mind the postulate that nothing exist except energy 
there be no ultimate solidity or substance to anything 
the earth man light heat electricity be compose of the same thing 
the universe consist of emptiness charge with electrical energy 
and matter as -PRON- know -PRON- be forever change form forever shift -PRON- tiny charge of energy and evolve -PRON- into another form though the process be generally so slow as to be imperceptible 
out in the nearvacuum of interstellar space there be tremendous energy reaction that give birth to atom and thereby produce the cosmic ray which be the most penetrating and powerful know to science 
the ray be produce in several form in fact in as many as eighty form each dependent on the birth of a particular type of atom 
one be generate when atom of helium gas suddenly organize -PRON- out of the electrcms and proton that wander through space other accompany the birth of silicon hydrogen or caesium atom and so on 
each ray have an identity and a use of hs own when bring under control and of course i have so far only skim the surface there be but seven type i have identify and control 
-PRON- first inkling of the tremendous possibility in the way of utilize the ray come during that mongolian trip 
-PRON- party be in the khangai mountain and -PRON- have sink an electroscope to a level foot below the surface of a small lake know as zagan nor 
the ray risfere powerfully and come through in different spectroscopic band answer to the synthesis of certain of the element 
this set -PRON- think and i soon isolate the ray correspond to the element hydrogen whose atom be simple of all 
i endeavor to determine the reaction of the ray by place in -PRON- path a minute quantity of hydrogen seal in a small capsule 
nothing happen at first and i experiment with collect and redirect a great volume of these particular ray all of which concentrate on the tiny capsule of hydrogen 
i step from the field laboratory to call an assistant and thereby save -PRON- own life for i have no sooner close the door when there be a terrific explosion within and the shack be blast to smithereen with a roar that knock -PRON- flat and bruise -PRON- body severely 
that be the beginning 
-PRON- see for every action there be an equal and opposite reaction and i have obtain the reaction equal to the birth of a definite number of hydrogen atom far off in space 
energy -PRON- be everywhere 
and to -PRON- alone -PRON- owe -PRON- existence 
unfortunately the follow experiment be watch by a number of the native member of -PRON- party and of course -PRON- report to what i later learn be the headquarters of this secret religious council 
thank to -PRON- -PRON- existence be now threaten by the danger of -PRON- energycontrol discovery get into -PRON- hand 
roger gasp 
-PRON- seem impossible 
professor -PRON- say 
but i have not the slight doubt of -PRON- word 
and -PRON- say element have actually be transmute in this manner 
yes 
i have takea uranium the heavy element in the atomic scale and from -PRON- have produce successively lead by remove ten proton from -PRON- nucleus gold by remove thirteen and hydrogen by remove ninetyone 
all element can be transmute into other by a similar process 
then these mongolian would be able to provide -PRON- with anything -PRON- need to make war on the rest of the world 
easily but donot misunderstand -PRON- as to who these enemy be 
this be a yellow peril -PRON- be face because the central stronghold of the enemy be among the yellow race 
the war would probably represent a struggle with about sixty per cent of the yellow race align with forty per cent of the white race against the remain sixty per cent of the white race and forty of the yellow 
-PRON- be to be entirely a religious war 
-PRON- see the buddhist now include the confucianist the taoist and the shintoist 
-PRON- have a foothold in all country and among all race though most powerful in the orient 
-PRON- the professor stop short in -PRON- discourse for at that moment the light flicker then go out leave -PRON- in almost total darkness 
the door to the sleeping room be close and the sole illumination come from the narrow ray of light from the porthole that filter underneath 
irene stifle a scream 
then roger experience a tingling of the scalp 
-PRON- hair seem to be rise on end for on the opposite wall there appear as if by magic a squat potbellie smile buddha wreathe in eerie green luminescence 
a daring robbery the light reappear as suddenly as -PRON- have be cut off the three occupant of the room stare at one another in wonder 
what kind of tomfoolery be this exploded roger 
but the professor merely stare and stare at the corner of the room 
-PRON- eye seem to bulge from -PRON- socket 
the ironbound case contain -PRON- apparatus be go 
irene rub -PRON- eye in startled amazement 
why daddy -PRON- exclaim the trunk have disappear 
how do -PRON- suppose -PRON- do that 
-PRON- father eye dull hopelessly and -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder resignedly 
-PRON- be beyond -PRON- dear -PRON- reply but -PRON- be go and i guess that be the end of -PRON- 
but object roger nothing supernatural about this 
professor steal -PRON- by enter this room through a trapdoor or a sliding panel or something get the captain and investigate 
surely -PRON- personal property can be recover -PRON- be still on board this vessel 
-PRON- do not appreciate the cleverness of the enemy -PRON- boy 
but -PRON- suggestion be a good one 
i shall call the captain 
a thorough search direct by the captain and -PRON- first officer reveal no clue as to the mean use in remove the miss case from the room 
careful sounding of the wall floor and ceiling and examination of the joint of these partition show not the slight evidence of -PRON- have be disturb 
well say anderson finally give -PRON- up as a bad job -PRON- certainly seem that some mean other than physical be resort to in remove the precious trunk 
but have every cabin on board search this evening 
meanwhile -PRON- should be dress for dinner 
what exclaim roger not near dinner time 
surely say the captayii consult -PRON- watch -PRON- lack but fourteen minute of the hour 
but but the professor stammer that be impossible 
-PRON- spend not more than an hour on the promenade and can have be here no more than an hour since -PRON- leave -PRON- quarter 
captain 
-PRON- be fully three hour since -PRON- leave -PRON- cabin 
professor 
the captain frown in perplexity while roger and -PRON- new find friend stare at one another in wonder have -PRON- suddenly exclaim the professor 
that buddha -PRON- be a hypnotic trick 
i have hear of such thing in the orient 
that image be somehow project on -PRON- wall and in stare at -PRON- -PRON- be subject to a state of mechanically induced hypnosis which permit the enemy to work without -PRON- conscious knowledge 
-PRON- may well have be under the influence for two hour without know -PRON- and the trunk be carry through the door while -PRON- stare at the green buddha with fix and sightless eye 
right say the captain 
like some of the trick of the indian fakir 
and say an indian in the very next cabin a suppose nobleman who be book as sidi mahavira 
-PRON- rush to the corridor and soon open the door of the adjoin cabin with -PRON- master key 
the room be empty but a hasty search of the occupant baggage disclose a miniature stereopticon with a curl section of the film use in place of slide in these small projection lantern -PRON- buddha say anderson as -PRON- hold the strip of film to the light 
the case against sidi mahavira be complete 
further search reveal the tiny hole which have be drill in the partition to permit of project the image to the wall of the professor room 
this be plug by mean of a small cork color to match the enamel of the metal partition 
the first officer also discover a snap switch and temporary wiring that have be use to control the light in the adjacent cabin 
so gloat the captain another of -PRON- mr mahavira or whatever -PRON- name be 
and well have -PRON- in iron directly 
but the professor trunk be not in the room and -PRON- be decide to postpone the search for these until after dinner 
the war be on -PRON- evening meal be consume in unwonted silence at the captain table and many of the diner who have cross with -PRON- before whisper in astonishment at the preoccupation of -PRON- usually jovial host 
the professor be nervous and ill at ease and roger steal occasional anxious glance at the blanched feature of irene 
four hour later every stateroom and cabin of the albatross have be search 
the baggage hold be carefully examine and the crew be at work shift the cargo in the freight compartment 
but no trace of the miss trunk have be find 
sidi mahavira be strangely missing and the captain be completely mystify 
at the approach of midnight with the light of st johns in newfoundland just vanish astern roger and the captain be join by the professor and irene at a point just about amidship of a deck immediately below the trapdoor of one of the well that extend up to the top between the gas bag of the huge cigar above -PRON- 
may -PRON- have escape up through here ask roger point to the circular trapdoor possible concede the captain though not probable 
-PRON- be a long climb up the ladder through these well and the top be not the safe place to be when -PRON- be speed along at over a hundred mile an hour 
-PRON- would have have to haul the case up there with rope and -PRON- hardly seem this could have be do undetecte 
but object roger there be the forward well connect with the lookout platform on top 
that one be equip with a lift right roger 
but that one be guard 
true 
but suppose -PRON- take a look at -PRON- 
-PRON- proceed along the passage and turn into a niche just forward of the radio cabin 
the guard who should have be station at this point be miss this exclaimed anderson something have happen here at that -PRON- touch with -PRON- finger a spot on the immaculate enamel of the bulkhead and bring -PRON- away stain red 
blood -PRON- shout murder one of -PRON- man 
by god fix -PRON- 
-PRON- tear at thejatch of the trapdoor overhead and -PRON- quickly swing downward reveal the long black shaft above 
the cage of the lift be at the top -PRON- should have be below 
at -PRON- manipulation of a starting lever on the wall the pulley at the low end of the shaft start revolve and the watcher know that the have start -PRON- descent 
the captain draw -PRON- automatic and climb the short ladder into the compartment at the bottom of the well 
stay there folk -PRON- order until i make sure the coast be clear 
in silence -PRON- watch as the cage come to rest and the captain gently lift the body of a uniformed man into the compartment alongside 
calkin -PRON- say sadly shoot through the heart 
poor devil 
now -PRON- war be -PRON- war 
professor 
there be a sound in the passage behind -PRON- and roger wheel suddenly to find -PRON- look into the muzzle of a blue automatic 
hand up snap the voice of the darkskinne individual whose grinning face appear behind the gun 
the passage be fill with man there must have be ten of -PRON- and each carry a weapon ready for instant use 
then there come a roar from above and one of the yellowskinned gunman scream and pitch forward to the floor 
roger pull irene into -PRON- arm as the captain automatic speak rapidly 
the din in the narrow passage be terrific as the automatic of the attacker answer the lone one overhead 
then all be quiet and through the acrid blue smoke roger see that the captain be sprawl over the body of -PRON- erstwhile petty officer calkin 
the professor have back into the comer hand raise above -PRON- head 
well -PRON- snap why donot -PRON- shoot and get -PRON- over with 
oh no -PRON- dear professor sneer the leader of the gang be entirely too useful 
-PRON- life and those of -PRON- daughter and mr erskine be to be spare for a high purpose 
please be so good as to mount the ladder and enter the cage 
the professor storm and roger rage but to no avail 
-PRON- be with keen satisfaction that roger note that the captain have account for three of the enemy before -PRON- fall 
irene shudder and cower at -PRON- side but be considerably relieve at know that -PRON- father life be in no immediate danger 
come now again snap the leader prod -PRON- into action with the muzzle of -PRON- automatic into the cage go on top 
there be nothing to do but comply and -PRON- be soon cram into the small car with the seven oriental 
at the top -PRON- emerge on the lookout platform and there in the light of the leader flashlight -PRON- make out the case that contain the professor apparatus 
overhead there come the throb of motor that entirely drown out the musical purr of the engine of the albatross 
roger strain -PRON- eye as the sound draw near and quickly make out the flickering of landing light that seem to dart here and there above -PRON- with the uncertain wavering of firefly 
the leader grunt a command and the ship floodlight spring into dazzle brilliance illuminate the landing space atop the albatross to the brightness of day 
-PRON- suddently dawn on roger that the purr of the great dirigible engine have cease evidently the enemy have find mean of choke the fuel line 
and an airplane be about to land on the top of the great liner of the air the professor speak out the albatross swing about with the wind gradually -PRON- lose headway while the airplane above circle low and low 
in a surprisingly short time the landing be make the huge cabin plane suddenly swoop down out of the biasness into the brilliance of the runway atop the dirigible 
the roar of -PRON- three motor have cease abruptly and the plane drop to a perfect threepoint landing at the far end of the runway then come toward -PRON- and be bring to a sudden stop alongside the lookout platform brake scream in protest 
two door open and from the first tumble the pilot a white man and apparently an american 
from the rear door step two of the short oriental and at a command from the leader -PRON- quickly load the professor case into the rear compartment of the plane body 
all hatch atop the albatross have be fasten from the outside and there now come loud thumping and shout from beneath one of these 
inside order the leader prod roger with -PRON- gun 
-PRON- be no sooner inside the cabin than the wheel chock be remove and the plane be swing around by the man outside 
the leader thrust the three captive into a small compartment similar to that on a standard pullman car and slam and lock the metal door 
but there be a window and -PRON- watch as the plane taxi to the aft end of the runway and be then swing around once more to head into the light wind 
there be the throbbing roar of the motor the man outside clamber in and with a quick short run and a sharp rise -PRON- zoom over the lookout platform and be off 
well say irene look from -PRON- father draw -PRON- abore illustration be a reproduction of a draw wbich appear in the september issue of the electrical experimtnter 
-PRON- be interesting to note that mr gemsback predict this type of machine which the author of this story have also make use of 
moreover -PRON- understand that such a machine be about to be try out very soon 
the idea in a few word may be summarize as follow the zeppelin type of airship have now an exterior power plant which be underslung beneath the airship 
mr gemsback have create a huge wind tunnel and instal the engine at various point in the tunnel 
this arrangement create a terrific suction and the airship literally suck -PRON- through the atr 
the advantage claim by mr gemsback be that wind resistance from the power plant be do away with and accident like that which recently befall the graf zeppelin when several of the power plant go out of commission be not likely to happen in this arrangement 
-PRON- should be easy to navigate an airship of this kizia because the windthrust against the underhung propeller of the old type be wholly want 
furthermore the power plant eat protect from the element and repair can be make with comparative ease while the airship be in flight and pallid feature to the grimness of this be quite different from the trip -PRON- have plan 
i wonder what be to become of -PRON- 
the professor seem incapable of speech but expression change to one of worried abstraction and -PRON- appear to be speak -PRON- thought aloud as -PRON- reply 
-PRON- be a peculiar procedure -PRON- say can understand -PRON- reason for spare -PRON- father life quite likely -PRON- be not sure -PRON- can completely solve -PRON- secret without instruction from -PRON- 
but -PRON- i canot see why -PRON- want to bring -PRON- along 
nor -PRON- 
what good -PRON- can be to -PRON- be beyond -PRON- 
if -PRON- intend to kill -PRON- -PRON- may have do -PRON- more quickly and easily before -PRON- leave funny 
professor ingall eye recover -PRON- former luster and snap never tell -PRON- -PRON- aver 
without certain information i have keep securely lock in -PRON- own brain -PRON- be helpless 
the apparatus be there to be sure but without -PRON- aid -PRON- be useless to -PRON- 
i shall not permit -PRON- to plunge -PRON- world into the hell of a devastating war even though -PRON- own life be forfeit 
roger purse -PRON- lip 
-PRON- think -PRON- understand now why -PRON- have kidnap irene -PRON- would use threat against -PRON- to coerce the old man but -PRON- do not voice -PRON- fear 
-PRON- still be unable to account for -PRON- own presence aboard the swiftly fly plane 
the albatross be leave far behind and -PRON- light recede rapidly finally be lose to view as the great cabin plane of the enemy climb higher and speed continually in what roger take to be a northwesterly direction 
wonder where -PRON- will take ivs -PRON- venture 
not to china i hope say irene 
no say the professor do not believe -PRON- be go that far yet 
-PRON- have divisional headquarter throughout the world and will undoubtedly take -PRON- to the near 
this just go to show how inefficient and slowmove -PRON- government be 
more than four year ago i report -PRON- finding during the mongolian expedition and i have be hammer at -PRON- ever since 
of course i do not report the result of -PRON- experiment since -PRON- be still in an uncompleted state 
but i have repeatedly warn the authority and suggest an investigation of the activity of the enemy in -PRON- own country 
what have -PRON- do 
nothing 
either -PRON- think i imagine the whole thing or else -PRON- have just table -PRON- report and recommendation and forget -PRON- as the idle dream of a crazy old scientist 
now when -PRON- get the report from the albatross some action may be forthcoming perhaps 
-PRON- speak bitterly and a silence ensue 
the steady thrum of the motor be muffle by the soundproof wall and the double window so that conversation in an ordinary tone of voice be not difficult 
but the prisoner do not converse at any great length for the next hour 
each be occupy with -PRON- own thought and these be not particularly hopeful or pleasant 
irene worry about -PRON- father and -PRON- be in an agony of spirit as -PRON- come to the realization of what horror may befall -PRON- cherish daughter at the hand of the conscienceless barbarian who have capture -PRON- 
roger think mainly of the girl also a shiver of dread come over -PRON- at thought of -PRON- fragile beauty in the clutch of such creature as have murder the captain and calkin 
the possible catastrophe to the world give -PRON- scarcely a thought 
a threat here be the rattling of a key in the lock and the professor stiffen -PRON- to tense expectancy 
irene turn -PRON- head and profess to be extremely interested in the moonlit water beneath -PRON- plainly visible through the window at which -PRON- sit 
roger lean protectingly forward interpose as much of -PRON- body as be possible between the door and the girl 
but -PRON- be a white man who enter and -PRON- smile cheerily as -PRON- look directly at roger 
-PRON- close the door softly behind -PRON- and shoot the bolt 
hello erskine -PRON- say 
tom patton exclaim roger springing to -PRON- foot 
what on earth bring -PRON- among these cutthroat and kidnaper 
-PRON- visitor laugh 
irene survey -PRON- with interest 
-PRON- be a welldressed young man about age with a massive head set between the shoulder of a pugilist 
-PRON- broad feature hold much of attractiveness but there be a sinister gleam in -PRON- eye and a sarcastic twist to -PRON- smile that belie the friendliness of -PRON- geeting 
-PRON- insult -PRON- friend erskine -PRON- laugh 
-PRON- be not cutthroat nor be -PRON- as bad as -PRON- be imply 
true -PRON- three have be take from the albatross without -PRON- consent but there be many good reason for this procedure and in the end -PRON- will all thank -PRON- for -PRON- 
may as well be on the win side -PRON- know not surprised at -PRON- be identify with -PRON- coolly retort roger 
-PRON- always manage to get in with the bad element at college and since 
irene and the professor listen in astonishment 
the animosity display by roger give -PRON- little hope of receive help from this white man 
tom patton devour irene with -PRON- eye and a flush of shame embarrassment chase the pallor from -PRON- cheek 
-PRON- be unkind erskine -PRON- smirk and -PRON- should endeavor to conquer this feeling now of all time 
i have much power with the gautaman and can make thing much easy for -PRON- if i so desire 
the gautaman interrupt the professor 
yes 
after gautama buddha founder of the religion 
-PRON- a buddhist ask roger in mock solemnity 
then there come an astounding thing a wink intend as a sly grimace but actually contort the face of patton into a gruesome sembknce of that of the popular conception of -PRON- satanic majesty 
irene turn cold 
no not exactly erskine old top -PRON- drawl 
but ally mind -PRON- i say ally with the gautaman for -PRON- common good wager -PRON- a onesided arrangement grunt roger 
patton scowl 
snap out of -PRON- erskine -PRON- snarl 
-PRON- be in -PRON- power and there s be about enough of this 
and i warn -PRON- to be more civil and to submit gracefully or thing will go much harder with all of -PRON- 
roger observe -PRON- greedy glance in direction and perforce subside 
now continue -PRON- evilly grin captor know -PRON- be curious so i be go to advise -PRON- as to -PRON- fate 
-PRON- be now enter davi strait and by morning will be somewhere over grant land or sverdrup island 
by ten oclock -PRON- shall have reach -PRON- destination an uncharted island in the arctic ocean 
here be the north american headquarters of -PRON- organization and -PRON- be from this base -PRON- be to operate with -PRON- assistance 
with -PRON- assistance snap the professor 
yes 
with -PRON- assistance -PRON- and think -PRON- be unprepared to force this assistance 
-PRON- have many mean many very persuade and always successful mean 
-PRON- professor be to instruct -PRON- scientist in the use of -PRON- marvelous invention use the equipment now store in the tail of this ship 
-PRON- -PRON- dear old college chum be to assist in build up -PRON- air fleet which be to become the most dangerous in the world 
if -PRON- refuse say roger -PRON- eye flash fire not refuse smile patton confidently 
the professor start to expostulate but be quickly wave into silence 
patton approach irene and -PRON- look up at -PRON- fearfully 
and the beautiful young lady -PRON- continue with an ugly leer see well see 
with this cryptic and disquieting remark -PRON- turn on -PRON- heel and leave the room again lock the door from the outside 
-PRON- gaze helplessly at one another after -PRON- have leave 
take stock hey sleep fitfully during the night make -PRON- as comfortable as possible in the thinly upholstered seat 
-PRON- grow quite cold toward morning and roger tiptoe to the side of irene who partly recline on the single settee cover -PRON- thinly clothe body as best -PRON- could with -PRON- own coat 
the professor stir and open -PRON- eye 
what be the time -PRON- boy -PRON- ask 
the professor sigh and sit erect be sure -PRON- be much later -PRON- whisper rise and walk stiffkneed to the window 
-PRON- grimace at the pain in -PRON- joint 
not as young as i use to be -PRON- conclude gravely 
roger smile at the comical expression on -PRON- countenance 
there be a peremptory knock at the door and irene be startle into wakefulness 
damn ejaculate roger under -PRON- breath 
then -PRON- draw the bolt -PRON- have so uselessly shoot after leave 
one of the oriental enter with a tray 
breakfast -PRON- state laconically not go to starve -PRON- at any rate comment roger when the door close behind -PRON- early visitor 
may the food not be drug ask irene endeavor to rearrange -PRON- glossy hair think not dear respond -PRON- father 
-PRON- wish to keep -PRON- alive and well for a time at least 
and the coffee do smell invite 
irene flush slightly and whisper a thank -PRON- when -PRON- discover -PRON- have be cover by coat and hand the garment to -PRON- 
-PRON- be not long in consume the tasty and generous portion and with the coming of the warmth that follow the turning on of the electric heat from somewhere outside -PRON- small room -PRON- feel more comfortable 
-PRON- be not long before -PRON- be again visit by patton and this time -PRON- bring with -PRON- several magazine which -PRON- present to irene with a great show of solicitude 
roger could have punch -PRON- smirking face but -PRON- content -PRON- with thrust -PRON- hand in -PRON- pocket and gaze from the window at the unbroken ice field that now glisten far beneath -PRON- ahead of schedule volunteer patton pleasantly 
be there in two hour now 
good pilot -PRON- have harry borden 
by the way erskine -PRON- s a new york boy like -PRON- 
yes say roger not deign to turn around 
yes 
and -PRON- will all need warm clothing when -PRON- land see that -PRON- be outfit 
-PRON- retreat without further speech and this time -PRON- do not lock the door 
evidently -PRON- have no fear of any action the captive may take 
roger grit -PRON- tooth in helpless rage 
the professor try to estimate -PRON- position from what patton have tell -PRON- the precede evening 
let -PRON- see now -PRON- say sverdrup island which -PRON- mention lie in about ninety degree longitude west from greenwich 
-PRON- extend above eighty degree north latitude 
grant land which -PRON- also mention be farther east and extend to about eightythree degree north 
-PRON- have pass whichever -PRON- cross so -PRON- may assume that -PRON- be at about one hundred degree west and say eightyfive north 
why good lord three thousand mile from where -PRON- be pick up 
and in little more than eight hour -PRON- stare at roger openmouthe 
yes i know this be a very fast ship say roger 
there be a few of these big monoplane that can do five hundred mile an hour when above thirty thousand foot 
but the friction object the bewilder professor the loss of propel effect in the rarer atmosphere 
i must be sadly out of date since i have be stick so closely to the laboratory 
some very recent development be responsible 
professor smile roger 
new idea in streamline and in lubrication of the external surface have reduce friction enormously 
then besides on ship of this sort the propeller be supplement by the reactive effect of a multitude of rapid explosion in gunlike tube beside the tail 
sort of a rocket action -PRON- know have not hear that be be commercially use 
i surely be behind the time 
oh not so far 
professor 
to -PRON- knowledge there be no more than six of such ship in existence 
and what puzzle -PRON- now be how one of the few come into the possession of these gautaman or whatever -PRON- call -PRON- 
evidently -PRON- have make rapid stride since i first learn of -PRON- existence 
and -PRON- must have on -PRON- side some wealth and some scientist as well 
-PRON- seem that way 
and i be wonder whether such alliance be make by force as -PRON- propose to obtain -PRON- service 
not necessarily 
there be a whole lot of fool in this world roger 
also there be many conscienceless man of wealth and influence who will go into any kind of venture that give promise of increase -PRON- already swell hoard 
and somehow this idea of a religious war strike -PRON- as a bit of irony especially as direct against -PRON- own country 
-PRON- who have be at the mercy of the fanatic for so many year be now threaten by fanatic of a different kind whose prohibition and ritual while of a greatly different sort would prove equally irksome and quite probably as flagrantly ignore 
roger nde a thoughtful agreement 
the arrival hey be interrupt by the entrance of a slinking brownskinne hunchback who be load down with heavy clothing 
there be warm furline boot for all fur cap coat and mitten 
mr patton say the brown coat be for the lady say the deform one as -PRON- sidle from the door 
irene pick up the garment indicate and be astonish to find that -PRON- be fashion from the fine sable and be beautifully tailor and line 
-PRON- hold the handsome coat to -PRON- face and bury -PRON- cheek in -PRON- rich softness exclaim aloud delightedly 
roger successfully repress a snort 
these gautaman -PRON- remark to the professor to hide -PRON- rage at patton speak very good english whatever -PRON- color 
almost without accent too 
probably all educate in -PRON- own university be the response 
another bit of irony 
there be a change in the note of the motor and the staccato rattle of the reaction tube cease 
-PRON- be slow down and the angle of the floor tell -PRON- of the start of the glide to a low altitude 
-PRON- crowd to the single window 
far below spread the vast almost unbroken expanse of the ice field drearily monotonous 
for some considerable time -PRON- see nothing to break the monotony 
then when -PRON- have reach a point only a few thousand foot above the broken surface the plane be bank and start to circle 
a minute later -PRON- see -PRON- destination a rugged island a single mountain peak -PRON- seem that thrust -PRON- upward through the ice to a height of fully two thousand foot 
there be no sign of life on the steeply slope side but at the top there be a flat space on which there appear a modern landing field and a number of hangar 
-PRON- do not seem to fear discovery remark roger 
no agree professor ingall 
right out in the open 
but then -PRON- be a long way from civilization off the regular air lane so there be very little danger 
yes and there be disappear gun under that innocent appear surface come the voice of patton who have slip into the room unobserved 
roger bite -PRON- lip to hold back the retort that spring to -PRON- unbidden 
-PRON- be too early to start trouble 
swiftly -PRON- descend the circle become ever small as the pilot bring -PRON- ship to the level of the polar retreat 
-PRON- could plainly see the sock as -PRON- swell to the breeze indicate the direction of the wind at the surface 
a moment later -PRON- have touch with scarcely a jolt and roll across the field to a stop 
well get into those wrap advise patton not be in the air for long but -PRON- fortythree below out there so -PRON- will need the fur 
without protest -PRON- bundle -PRON- into the clothing -PRON- have provide and be soon at the door of the cabin 
the rest of the passenger and the crew have already quit the ship but patton hand -PRON- from the exit with mock courtesy 
-PRON- be especially considerate of irene 
welcome to new kurja -PRON- exclaim as -PRON- first breath on the strange soil draw in the sear frostiness of the unbelievable cold 
a group of heavily furred individual be gather about the entrance of the building toward which -PRON- be lead by patton and -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to run the gauntlet of the gape jabber crowd 
irene clung to the arm of -PRON- father on the one side and to roger on the other bury -PRON- face in the huge collar of -PRON- fur coat 
roger be conscious of a sea of staring face some white some brown some yellow 
then -PRON- be within the building and be hustle to a wait lift 
chandra dai hey descend rapidly for many hundred of foot and eventually step from the cage into a brightly light corridor 
patton lead -PRON- through this corridor to a small metal door which -PRON- open and pass through without ceremony 
instead of a templelike interior the shrine of the buddha which -PRON- have fully expect to enter -PRON- find -PRON- in a large room that may well have be the office of a great american business executive 
at a large desk that be place in the exact center of the heavy chinese rug which cover the middle of the floor there sit a man a man who but for the slightly dark complexion and the exceedingly glossy black hair and mustache may have be that very executive 
-PRON- look up inquiringly at the approach of patton 
-PRON- be here chandra dai state that worthy in a most surprisingly deferential tone 
-PRON- be well 
the sinister black eye survey -PRON- with cold calculation rest long on the figure of irene who have throw back -PRON- heavy coat iri the warmth of the underground quarter 
roger make as if to speak but be silence by a stern look and a warning motion of chandra hand 
that same hand with -PRON- longpointed finger stray to a roy of button on the desk top 
three of these -PRON- press in turn then -PRON- speak 
-PRON- will all three proceed to -PRON- quarter -PRON- say in a steely voice where -PRON- instrurtion will be give -PRON- in a short time 
do not attempt resistance for -PRON- be useless and will cause much unpleasantness to yourself 
-PRON- shall come to a complete understanding within the hour 
-PRON- smile meaningly as -PRON- conclude 
a giant negro unclad with the exception of trouser and shoe have enter the room 
chandra dai point to the professor as if designate an unimportant article of furniture 
ben sair -PRON- address the negro take -PRON- to and there await instruction 
the professor bow -PRON- head and hesitatingly follow the big black man 
irene cry out and make as if to follow 
fear not 
miss ingall come the voice of chandra dai with an almost feline purr no harm will come to -PRON- father nor to -PRON- 
-PRON- must only obey order 
irene toss -PRON- head but forebore reply 
a heavyfeature white woman who have enter unobserv step to -PRON- side 
-PRON- be a veritable amazon and irene recoil at the touch of -PRON- hand 
come young lady boom the voice be scare of molly cork take ye to -PRON- room 
irene follow as have -PRON- father throw a glance of encouragement to roger as -PRON- pass -PRON- 
another arrival appear in the form of the young chap who have leave the pilot seat of the raid plane when -PRON- land atop the albatross 
-PRON- be a smile faced chunky individual and roger take an immediate like to -PRON- 
borden come the voice of chandra dai -PRON- will escort mr erskine to and remain with -PRON- until further order reach yofu 
that be all 
-PRON- turn -PRON- attention to patton who have draw near and roger follow the quick rolling step of harry borden as -PRON- lead the way to a door at the far end of the room 
-PRON- pass through a long corridor enter a lift and be drop several hundred foot deep into the recess of the strange honeycombed mountain 
when at length -PRON- reach the quarter that be to be -PRON- express -PRON- amazement to -PRON- comically grin guide and guard 
these must be tremendous working -PRON- be in -PRON- exclaim canot conceive of this retreat be the work of human hand 
-PRON- donot know the half brother grin borden 
this be some joint -PRON- have come to about fifteen thousand people house here and this old hollowedout mountain -PRON- call new kurja be big than one of those new hundredstory skyscraper in new york factory too and arsenal and a church a temple i mean 
forceful persuasion oger gaze at -PRON- guide in amazement 
the room to which -PRON- have be assign would have do credit to the fine of firstclass hotel and everything have be provide for the comfort of the occupant 
but i donot get -PRON- borden -PRON- say 
do this place form a headquarters for these gautaman and be -PRON- one of -PRON- 
harry borden indulge in a broad grin and a significant wink 
sure -PRON- belong to -PRON- and one of -PRON- 
but say this buddhism business be the bunk 
this be an armed camp and be here for no other reason than to prepare for the big war 
the religious be just camouflage 
-PRON- mean the plan be not really for a religious war but for a plain war of conquest to satisfy somebodys lust for power and empire about the size of -PRON- 
but the buddhist idea be at the bottom of -PRON- all 
the way i get -PRON- -PRON- be something like the old crusade of medieval history 
the religion of buddha originate in india as a heresy quickly gain a strong foothold and spread throughout the orient finally -PRON- die out pretty much in india but become very strong in china and japan 
between the fifth and ninth century the buddhist undergo great persecution in china and in the ninth century -PRON- amalgamate in japan into the the dual shinto 
the ritual have alter greatly since that time but the faithful have constantly increase in number and have spread all over the world though this be hardly suspect in country 
buddhism never fully recover from the great persecution of the ninth century in china when temple and monastery of the religion be raze 
neither have -PRON- ever forget and for many year a revenge have be plan 
india be to be conquer and force to again enter the fold the east russia europe the america be to follow 
buddhism be to be establish as the world religion compulsory of course 
but the dream of the true believer have be commercialize by clever politician and shady financial interest of all land and -PRON- be to really work out as a huge world revolution that will take the power out of the hand of the in and put -PRON- in the hand of the out 
an absolute monarchy be to be set up and all the world be to become subservient to a supreme lama who will be none other than the name remain unspoken for there be an angry buzz from an instrument adjacent to the write desk and harry hasten to this apparatus 
-PRON- touch a lever and the voice of chandra dai speak sharply 
dial -PRON- command and show erskine the happening on the screen 
the voice cease and borden manipulate a dial like that of an automatic telephone 
a screen of about two foot in length and slightly less height illuminate brightly and show in clear relief the interior of a laboratory of considerable size where sit professor ingall before a long bench on which there be array a multitude of scientific instrument and much paraphernalia 
strew on the floor be the professor open case and a litter of excelsior and torn paper show the haste with which -PRON- have be unpacked 
over the professor stoop form lean the sinister figure of chandra dai 
will -PRON- agree 
professor -PRON- ask in silken tone 
never chandra dai speak sharply to ben sair whose great bulk stand prop against the near wall of the laboratory 
the slide beni -PRON- order 
then the huge negro draw back a panel of the wall and roger let forth a yell of fury that ring out simultaneously with the shriek that come from the professor throat 
the panel open into a brightly light room boudoir where the panic stricken girl retreat before the menacing figure of tom patton 
-PRON- draw -PRON- negligee about -PRON- slim body and scream again and again as the evil face of patton near -PRON- own 
-PRON- god groan roger as the professor slump weakly into -PRON- chair 
can nothing stop -PRON- agree reply borden soothingly 
watch the scene and the sound issue from the combined voicetelevision apparatus impress -PRON- indelibly in memory scream and the sheer terror in -PRON- face cause -PRON- to seethe with fury finger be now twist in the fold of -PRON- filmy garment -PRON- seem about to tear -PRON- in shred 
professor ingall shake as with the ague nod violently to indicate -PRON- consent 
-PRON- be too overcome to speak 
stop patton call chandra dai 
irene slump to the floor as -PRON- assailant turn on -PRON- heel and leave the boudoir 
ben sair close the panel slowly 
-PRON- win come the professor voice faintly start with the disintegration of hydrogen atom 
-PRON- reach for a stoppered test tube 
turn day pass and roger have not yet be approach with regard to -PRON- own expected espousal of the cause of the gautaman 
harry borden remain with -PRON- constantly and -PRON- liking for the cheerful pilot increase hourly 
but -PRON- find -PRON- difficult to obtain further information from -PRON- regard the activity of chandra dai and -PRON- follower 
-PRON- do learn that harry be a fugitive from justice have become embroil in certain smuggling and hijacking operation in the state 
but borden have evidently be warn against speak too freely regard the plan of the gautaman 
perhaps -PRON- be not as well inform -PRON- as may be 
only at meal time do -PRON- see the professor though -PRON- be permit to visit with irene more often 
the meal excellently prepare and serve be eat in a small dining room where chandra dai preside at table 
-PRON- seem bent on keep the three captive under -PRON- watchful eye and continue to dine with -PRON- in private 
-PRON- manner be those of the culture host rather than of the stem jailer and -PRON- steadfastly refuse to speak of -PRON- incarceration or of the reason for -PRON- 
to irene -PRON- be the personification of courtesy and gallantry -PRON- be a bit too attentive roger think 
the professor speak not at all of the experiment that be under way in the laboratory of new kurja 
-PRON- seem to shrivel and wilt beneath -PRON- eye when -PRON- address -PRON- 
-PRON- great spirit be break for the sake of safety -PRON- have sacrifice honor and prostitute -PRON- scientific knowledge to the greed of an infamous horde of criminal 
irene brood and fret over the all too apparent failure of -PRON- general health and vigor 
there come a day when chandra dai speak abruptly of -PRON- plan for roger 
erskine -PRON- say at the noonday meal -PRON- be to be a great honor 
-PRON- be to become commanderinchief of the air force of the gautaman under -PRON- able direction this air force be to grow from -PRON- present nucleus to the great and most destructive in the world 
if i refuse 
the master smile 
that -PRON- will not do -PRON- state confidently 
as -PRON- observe in the case of the professor -PRON- have mean of overcome the scruple of ordinary mortal 
no -PRON- will not refuse 
and -PRON- must not think that in -PRON- going to and fro in -PRON- aircraft -PRON- will be able to escape 
every craft -PRON- occupy will be constantly watch in -PRON- television screen and at the first evidence of treachery the gas tank will be fire by radio 
-PRON- be already fully equip to do these thing 
if i agree 
-PRON- will immediately set about inspect and test -PRON- present equipment and formulating plan for the altering of the present craft to incorporate the new disintegratingray apparatus -PRON- be develop with the professor assistance 
-PRON- will also supervise the design of new and speedy craft that will utilize the atomic motor likewise be develop with the professor kind assistance 
-PRON- experience have fit -PRON- for the further work of organize a number of factory throughout the world to produce in great quantity the new craft to be develop by -PRON- to supervise the training of instructor who will in turn make firstclass pilot of the require number of recruit 
then when the great day come yours will be the honor of direct the activity of the great fleet that be to bring destruction to the world from the air 
roger gasp 
-PRON- expect -PRON- to wage a war of destruction against -PRON- own people 
to assist the enemy whose cause i can not embrace in a ruthless campaign against those i love and honor 
there be no alternative save perhaps hari kari 
and -PRON- shall guard carefully against that possibility 
be -PRON- not better moreover to destroy than to be destroy a hot retort spring to tongue but the pro210 lessor not look np from -PRON- plate kick -PRON- ankle violently under the table 
-PRON- choke back the impulse and hastily swallow a portion of food to hide -PRON- rage 
the master watch -PRON- narrowly 
this afternoon -PRON- continue -PRON- will make a flight in one of -PRON- small pursuit plane pay particular attention to -PRON- fly quality and construction 
i shall expect a report of -PRON- finding and recommendation as to the change of design necessary to adapt these plane to the new motive power and armament 
borden will accompany -PRON- 
may i go alo ask irene 
chandra dai smile at -PRON- indulgently 
these pursuit plane be not large enough for three passenger -PRON- explain 
besides -PRON- have cqen cockpit and -PRON- would be very cold 
irene pout coaxingly 
but i would so enjoy the ride -PRON- beg 
the professor break into the conversation 
-PRON- would do -PRON- world of good chandra dai -PRON- say kick ankle once more to indicate -PRON- desire that -PRON- be permit to go 
the master hesitate 
irene smile archly 
very well -PRON- agree 
-PRON- shall use one of the fivepassenger cabin plane for the first flight and -PRON- may accompany erskine and borden 
irene thank -PRON- profusely and -PRON- beam -PRON- good nature 
but the steely crispness return to -PRON- voice when -PRON- again address roger 
-PRON- will prepare the same sort of report on the cabin plane erskine -PRON- order rise from the table 
roger bow in order to hide the scowl that wrinkle -PRON- forehead 
the professor act a hour later roger and borden ascended to the surface where -PRON- be meet by chandra dai who have accompany irene to the hangar 
a sleek singlemotore cabin plane of the type that have signal the albatross await -PRON- come 
and at the door stand tom patton smile satanically 
roger want more than ever to punch that evil face 
patton will accompany -PRON- state chandra dai shortly 
irene shrink from -PRON- as -PRON- enter the door of the cabin 
harry borden whisper encouragement in -PRON- ear worry about that baby -PRON- say can take care of -PRON- 
with borden in the pilot seat and roger at -PRON- side irene and patton occupy the passenger seat in the rear 
a gang of wait coolie trundle the ship from the hangar and head -PRON- into the wind 
great old crate these be say borden as -PRON- snap the starting switch that send the four hundred horsepower radial barking and sputtering 
-PRON- start hard in this cold though 
-PRON- be several minute before the engine have warm up enough to fire evenly and chandra sinister leer grace the window until borden wave -PRON- arm 
then -PRON- withdraw -PRON- face the chock be remove from under the wheel and with the roar of the gunned motor the plane slip rapidly along the smooth surface of the artificial field 
simultaneously -PRON- see two of the small pursuitjilane taxi over the field and these take to the air before the tail of -PRON- own ship be off be well chaperone erskine say patton spitefully as -PRON- ship swing out over the dreary ice pack 
the two small plane circle about and fall in behind the large ship to follow in triangular formation 
roger deign no reply but -PRON- ease -PRON- into such a position that -PRON- could watch patton from the comer of -PRON- eye 
borden head due south and begin a run fire of comment regard the good and bad point of the ship 
-PRON- handle nicely for such a heavy crate -PRON- say and -PRON- couldnot bust -PRON- up with a cyclone 
all steel -PRON- know with welded strut and reinforcement a gun back of patton there and here the trip of the two tunnel gun 
-PRON- point to the butt of the twin gun that project into the cabin underneath the instrument board 
web belt of shine ammunition be in place and roger shudder as -PRON- think of the stream of flame death that could spew from those weapon at a mere pressure of the trip 
-PRON- have never fire a machine gun but -PRON- fully understand -PRON- operation and capability 
how much fuel do -PRON- carry -PRON- ask 
enough for about five thousand mile come the reply and the tank be full now 
but -PRON- ainot go that far this time 
the irrepressible borden laugh 
but patton be intent on make the trip unpleasant 
look here erskine -PRON- interrupt the way -PRON- keep tab on -PRON- back in new kurja 
-PRON- point to a pair of metal discs set into the cabin ceiling 
each be of ten inch diameter and of dull gray color 
television transmitter and receiver discs -PRON- explain and continually in use at the other end 
watch 
-PRON- snap a small switch and one of the discs flash a view of the operating room at the base where a number of similar screen be closely watch by attendant 
-PRON- manipulate a dial and the scene change shift from room to room of the stronghold -PRON- have leave far behind 
-PRON- stop the action when a view of the laboratory be obtain 
irene gurgle delightedly as -PRON- see the figure of -PRON- father bend over a complicated mechanism with which -PRON- be work 
in the room there be ben sair and three other assistant and chandra dai -PRON- be watch the experiment 
a beam of crystalwhite light shoot from out the apparatus and impinge on a small test tube from which there come a wisp of smoke 
then as -PRON- watch interestedly a surprising thing happen 
the professor suddenly straighten up and the light beam shift quickly in the direction of chandra midsection 
there be another wisp of smoke and chandra dai vanish into thin air 
ben sair fall to -PRON- knee and -PRON- could see -PRON- black jaw chatter with fear 
god kill the master exclaim roger 
patton chortle as irene cover -PRON- eye with tremble hand 
now i be the master -PRON- shout 
warren ingall sacrifice ack in the laboratory of new kurja professor ingall spread terror among the remain occupant of the large room 
-PRON- swing on -PRON- heel as two of the laboratory assistant make a rush for -PRON- 
-PRON- swing the devastating beam of mysterious limpid light and the headlong dash of the two aggressor end abruptly with the complete disintegration of -PRON- body 
flicker pinpoint of shortlive brilliance be all that mark the instantaneous transition from palpitate live organism to nothingness 
ben sair cower against the wall shiver with superstitious dread to -PRON- this glitteringeye white man be a reincarnation of some longforgotten voodoo 
but the other assistant a lithe burman have slip behind a large cabinet and -PRON- start blaze away with an automatic 
fortunately for the professor -PRON- aim be none too good for the setting of the deathray be such that the metal cabinet form an insulator 
in the short interval in which the professor make rapid adjustment to -PRON- apparatus the burman empty the magazine of -PRON- weapon without cause other damage than the shattering of much glassware and the demolishing of a wallmounte television screen 
ben sair be speechless and helpless with fright and -PRON- eye roll until only the white be visible 
then the burman slip a fresh clip of cartridge into -PRON- gun and take more careful aim at the professor just as the crystal ray change color and become a vicious carmine 
simultaneously with the shot that strike the professor in the left shoulder the metal of the cabinet spurt a shower of spark with a hiss and a rumble that shake the floor 
the burman vanish as have the first three 
the big negro recover some of -PRON- courage as -PRON- see that the professor have slip to the floor and be weakly attempt to stanch the flow of blood from -PRON- shatter shoulder 
mister professor -PRON- say in quaver voice let -PRON- help -PRON- 
just donot turn the lightning machine on ben sair and hell stick to -PRON- 
all right ben sair 
come here and bind this up 
-PRON- have tear a strip of linen from -PRON- shirt and the negro bandage the lacerated shoulder as best -PRON- could with palsied finger 
now help -PRON- with this other machine say the professor as -PRON- struggle to -PRON- foot and drag -PRON- weary body to another and still untried mechanism that have just be complete under -PRON- instruction 
this incorporate the usual impinge disc and conical collector of the cosmic ray but there be no less than twentyfive prism and reflector to segregate separate element from the conglomerate assemblage bring in from the depth of space 
a series of filter and intensifier direct the separate component onto a platform whereon there repose a lump of antimony no large than a walnut 
the two movable pole of a huge electromagnet be bring into close proximity to the lump of antimony as the professor manipulate a handwheel at either side of the platform 
when all adjustment have be complete to -PRON- satisfaction -PRON- pull the lever of a start box and there be the smooth whir of a motor from somewhere within the mechanism 
in a hollow shiny sphere beneath the platform there rise the hum of a thousand bumblebee and scintillate light play over the reflector and prism 
the small lump of antimony glow with an unearthly light and -PRON- seem to quiver and pulsate like a live thing 
ben sair watch with increase concern 
ben sair mumble the professor who be rapidly weaken -PRON- be go to save the world -PRON- and -PRON- be go to save roger erskine and -PRON- daughter out there in that airplane 
when new kurja be go roger will find mean of overcome the vicious tom patton and of save irene 
something tell -PRON- that all will be well with -PRON- 
at any rate -PRON- be -PRON- only chance 
the negro do not understand 
-PRON- know only that the weird flame nugget on the platform of this crazy white man machine be dance and whirl like a dervish afire 
as -PRON- watch -PRON- with bulge eye -PRON- grow large and large until -PRON- be as big as a baseball 
faster and faster as the pole automatically move apart the lump spin take on mass from the acquisition of electron from the disintegrated component of the surround atmosphere 
-PRON- expand until -PRON- seem to be touch the pole piece between which -PRON- rotate so speedily 
the pole could move no further apart 
the professor look on with glaze eye 
-PRON- cling to the work bench for support 
there be a smile of triumph on -PRON- face 
success 
success -PRON- exclaim 
suddenly ben sair be overcome with nauseate fright 
-PRON- tooth chatter anew and with an abrupt maniacal impulse -PRON- spring for the professor throat 
-PRON- be a short struggle for the professor vitality be ebb fast and those great black paw have the strength of relentless savagery 
but professor ingall go to -PRON- reward with peace and joy in -PRON- heart 
-PRON- last conscious thought be the unquestionable certitude of safely that come to -PRON- somehow from the great beyond into which -PRON- soul be pass 
ben sair rise to -PRON- foot and -PRON- savage intellect grow foggy when -PRON- see that the platform and the electromagnet have vanish along with most of the remainder of the strange machine and that the whirl sphere be now the size of a cocoanut and spin unsupported in the jposition in which -PRON- have repose 
in an accession of uncouth fury -PRON- pick up an iron bar from a nearby tool rack and strike violently with -PRON- at the spin ball of fire 
at contact of the cold metal there be a blind flash and the bar be tom violently from -PRON- hand merge into and become a part of the strange orb which be now deflect from -PRON- position and swing away from the remain of the machine in a reel zigzag path 
-PRON- hand be sear bare of flesh and -PRON- scream with pain 
the nebulous mass gather speed in -PRON- movement and knock about the laboratory with rapid acceleration annihilate and take into -PRON- every object with which -PRON- contact 
the very air of the room grow rare as -PRON- contribute to the everincrease mass of the uncanny thing the professor have create 
the end of new kurja -PRON- laboratory become a veritable gehenna 
the metal wall vibrate to the unearthly influence from within the whirl dart globe 
ben sair screech when -PRON- look at the bare flesh of -PRON- chest and see that -PRON- glow and twitch with the movement of rivulet of purple flame that crawl rapidly over the skin in a swiftly spread network 
-PRON- arm lose -PRON- tremendous muscular power and -PRON- grow as weak as a child 
-PRON- leg fail to support the black bulk of -PRON- body and -PRON- fall to -PRON- knee and crawl painfully toward the door 
the floor react to -PRON- touch with a stinging vibration that further numb -PRON- muscle and paralyze -PRON- joint 
-PRON- be barely able to reach the door and draw the bolt and when -PRON- have accomplish this -PRON- lie in an immobile heap across the sill 
there be shouting and rapid footstep in the corridor but -PRON- come faintly to ben consciousness through the everrising roar of the commotion within the laboratory 
new kurja be shake to -PRON- foundation and the inhabitant be rush blindly from passage to passage seek the cause of the disturbance 
there be outcry and argument 
a voice call loudly for chandra dai and ben sair try to reply 
but -PRON- voice refuse to answer to -PRON- will 
the mammoth fiery ball be upon -PRON- and with a final hcless struggle -PRON- be take painlessly into -PRON- rapacious roaring interior 
the ceiling collapse with a twang like a snap violin string of brobdingnagian proportion 
with -PRON- there come the heavy furniture from the floor above all go to swell the now bloated monster of destruction 
over the din there come the shriek of the gautaman who scramble for the lift in futile attempt to escape 
on the uppermost surface mechanician be frantically struggle with the motor of all available plane 
none of -PRON- would start for the ignition system be paralyze by the emanation of that inexplicable fury that be plough -PRON- alldevoure way through the low level gain in bulk and destructive power as -PRON- progress 
then with a groan and a shudder the mountain that be new kurja dissolve like melting paraffin and sink with a convulsive protest into the polar sea 
the massed ice shrivel and draw away as if in alarm and an immense seething steam cauldron mark the spot 
then with a final turbulent uproar a geyser shoot skyward redlit and aweinspiring 
when this subside all be still and nothing remain save a halfmile circle of open ter that quickly glaze over with newlyforme ice 
the struggle in the plane -PRON- four occupant of the cabin plane which have leave the base so short a time before watch the destruction of new kurja in the television screen 
irene sob out -PRON- grief at the passing of -PRON- father know full well that -PRON- sacrifice be make in a desperate hope of save -PRON- and with the very definite intent of upset the plan of chandra dai and -PRON- ilk 
tom patton become a rave maniac as -PRON- hope of personal glory and power totter and fall 
harry borden keep the ship to -PRON- original course and watch the pictured holocaust with considerable of awe but with little apparent regret 
roger be dumfounde at the development and do -PRON- ineffectual best to comfort the unexpectedly orphan girl 
-PRON- sob continue unabated as -PRON- turn from the screen before the final curtain be ring on the tragedy 
then when the last vestige of new kurja have disappear from -PRON- view tom patton grasp irene by the wrist and menace roger with -PRON- automatic 
-PRON- snarl out a savage oath as -PRON- draw the resist girl to the seat -PRON- have previously occupy keep roger cover throughout the maneuver 
borden -PRON- order new go and so be chandra dai 
but the cause live on and i intend to obtain control of the other base near point barrow head there at once and there become master 
this dizzy blonde will be mistress 
at the insult roger duck quickly and throw -PRON- full weight into a lunge that carry -PRON- into a desperate grapple with the infuriated patton 
-PRON- grasp the wrist of the astonished outlaw in time to spoil -PRON- aim and the bullet intend for heart speed harmlessly through the roof of the cabin 
but patton wrench -PRON- free loose -PRON- hold on irene as -PRON- do so 
-PRON- back from furious rush and again raise -PRON- pistol 
borden have rise from -PRON- seat a scowl of rage on -PRON- rotund countenance 
cut -PRON- patton -PRON- snap get -PRON- all kill 
patton laugh and swing -PRON- weapon in the pilot direction fire rapidly 
roger swing out with -PRON- right and catch the madman full on the jaw with a terrific punch but too late to save poor borden first shot have strike the jovial pilot in the forehead and -PRON- fall lifeless over the back of -PRON- seat -PRON- head drill through 
patton go down under blow but -PRON- quickly scramble to a sit position and fire once more 
roger open -PRON- mouth in surprise and clamp -PRON- hand to -PRON- right thigh where the metalcased bullet have strike 
meanwhile without a pilot the plane have go into a spin and the three live occupant be tumble in a heap on the floor of the cabin 
roger obtain a firm grip on the muzzle of the automatic and slowly but surely twist -PRON- from grip 
then from an almost prone position -PRON- strike out wildly with the weapon again and again 
a mist have gather before -PRON- eye but -PRON- feel the contact of the pistol butt as -PRON- crash into skull 
the mist clear and -PRON- see that irene have faint and be wedge between -PRON- seat and the wall of the cabin face have disappear in a bloody smear and -PRON- lie quite still where -PRON- have roll 
dazedly roger crawl along the wall to the pilot seat and grasp the stick hazily -PRON- fuss with the control try to remember how to pull out of the spin 
the gray expanse of ice below come rush upward whirl dizzily as -PRON- loom closer and close 
then the mist clear once more and -PRON- remember 
the nose of the ship come up and -PRON- be safe but not a hundred foot above the menacing ice pack 
the motor be still pound steadily under full gun and -PRON- gain altitude rapidly 
roger have entirely forget the two pursuit plane that have follow from new kurja 
with the ship level off at a safe altitude -PRON- turn to see whether irene be regain consciousness 
-PRON- smile wanly but encouragingly from -PRON- seat which -PRON- have regain unassisted 
all right dear -PRON- ask all right be the brave reply 
be -PRON- 
right leg completely numb -PRON- say 
but i can get along 
be patton dead 
quite say irene with a shudder 
the body of harry borden have roll aside and wedge under the seat alongside -PRON- own and roger regard -PRON- with something of real sorrow in -PRON- heart 
-PRON- would have to dump the two body overboard but -PRON- would wait until feeling return to that numb right leg 
then a surprising thing occur 
the ship seem to shudder from the impact of bullet that suddenly rake the cabin from stem to stern 
one of the pursuit plane have turn -PRON- gun loose on -PRON- 
roger have never be in an air fight but -PRON- be an experienced flyer and have a good idea of how -PRON- should be do 
stunt be not easy with the heavy cabin plane but -PRON- zoom up and roll over bring the nose of the ship around 
-PRON- see the nose of one of the pursuit plane head directly for -PRON- and -PRON- duck instinctively shout to irene to do likewise 
glass from the front window spintere and fly past as a burst from the small plane sputter through 
-PRON- bring the nose of the ship all the way over and find the other pursuit plane dead on the sight of -PRON- own gun 
hardly realize what -PRON- be do nor why -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- reach out and press the trip 
-PRON- watch the burst as -PRON- stipple a pattern across the windshield of the small plane see the pilot fle -PRON- arm outward and slump against the forward crash pad 
-PRON- have make a killing at -PRON- first try irene save -PRON- lack smoke come from under the motor housing of the pursuit plane and -PRON- slip into the spin that would carry -PRON- to the ice far below 
forget the other ship forget everything save that -PRON- have shoot down a fighting plane in actual combat -PRON- follow in a dive until -PRON- see -PRON- crash and burst into flame 
then -PRON- zoom up once more and as -PRON- do so the cabin be again rake by the search bullet from the enemy gun 
-PRON- come on over in a loop and manage to get the small plane in -PRON- sight while -PRON- be on -PRON- back 
once more -PRON- press the trip without apparent result 
irene clung gamely to -PRON- seat though -PRON- have be considerably batter about by the quick lunge of the ship 
-PRON- come on over and level off but the second plane be not in sight -PRON- be underneath and rise to the attack unseen 
the cabin be again rake by a burst from the gun of the enemy 
the little plane be very fast and handle so easily that roger have little hope of shake the fellow off -PRON- tail 
-PRON- bank and roll to no avail 
-PRON- put the nose down once more and then come back on the stick to start a loop warning irene to hold fast 
still -PRON- could not shake off that persistent little ship 
-PRON- reach the top of the loop then half roll out bank around and find that -PRON- pursuer be still close on -PRON- tail 
when -PRON- level off -PRON- see that irene be crawl to the rear of the cabin 
keep down -PRON- shout 
but -PRON- pay no attention and quickly reach the rear gun though a stream of lead be rip through the cabin shatter the window and perforate the steel wall in search pattern 
the brave girl swing the gun around and find the trip 
-PRON- aim be wild at first but -PRON- sway the muzzle back and forth up and down until the tracer show that -PRON- have find -PRON- mark 
the ammunition belt be nearly empty and the barrel smoke hot 
but a burst of flame come from the pursue plane and the pilot rise in -PRON- seat terrorstricken at the unexpected result of the girl desperate endeavor 
in a moment -PRON- be the center of a flame hurricane and the plane slip rapidly downward carry -PRON- to the most terrible of death 
irene cover -PRON- eye as -PRON- crawl from the cockpit and jump prefer the quick way to be roast alive 
good girl shout roger gleefully 
a few minute later roger negotiate a skillful lar ding on a smooth area -PRON- have locate in the ice field 
-PRON- remove the two body from the bulletriddled plane and roger extract a packet of paper from coat that later prove of tremendous value 
-PRON- determine -PRON- position by use of the sextant which -PRON- have find in the ship equipment 
from the chart -PRON- discover that -PRON- be about five hundred mile due north of etah and -PRON- decide to proceed there for medical attention and provision 
the wound in -PRON- thigh be not serious the metalcased bullet from automatic have drill the fleshy portion cleanly through apparently miss the bone entirely 
with help -PRON- bind -PRON- as well as possible and though -PRON- could scarcely bear -PRON- weight on the injure limb be not seriously inconvenience 
when -PRON- take off irene snuggle into the seat at -PRON- side with a sigh of relief 
-PRON- have be very cold outside and the cabin be comparatively warm though the wind whistle through a hundred bullet hole in window and wall 
poor father -PRON- groan as roger head the ship toward the south and climb rapidly 
if -PRON- could only have -PRON- with -PRON- 
i shall miss wm terribly -PRON- have be constant companion since mother pass away 
now i i be alone 
-PRON- stare dryeye into the heavens suffer mutely as roger rack -PRON- brain for a suitable reply 
no dear -PRON- finally venture not alone 
if -PRON- will let -PRON- i shall always be at -PRON- side 
i i love -PRON- irene and want -PRON- for -PRON- wife 
then come the tear -PRON- have repress and somehow -PRON- find -PRON- very easy and very pleasant to move into the protect embrace of encircle right arm as -PRON- fly the ship lefthande 
-PRON- cry out -PRON- mingled grief and happiness in the hollow of -PRON- shoulder as the plane roar swiftly in the direction of civilization and future happiness 
the previous monotony of existence be never to return and out there over the chill polar floe -PRON- visione happily the contentment and joy that be to be -PRON- lot with irene as -PRON- companion 
but little do either of -PRON- realize that -PRON- be to receive the plaudit and gratitude of the world a worldj that be to awake to the knowledge of the catastrophe that threaten and that be to find mean of stamp out the terrible menace of the gautaman 
for the paper roger have take from patton reveal the whole plot the identity of the leader the location of the many basis arsenal everything 
and with this information in the hand of a newlyformed international police -PRON- be not difficult to make a clean sweep of the menacious conspirator 
the name of warren ingall live on enshrine in the memory of the masse 
-PRON- sacrifice have not be in vain 
the end 
the noise increase like the booming of a thousand gns 
the fissure be open wide the planet be separate 
i have wedge -PRON- between two boulder to keep from leave the ground mechanic give one last twist to the propeller 
a sharp staccato crackling bit the air as the engine of the giant plane bark out -PRON- challenge to the element roar still louder and with a whine that break into an increase crescendo settle down to -PRON- stride a deepthroate purr that ebbed and flow from the heart of the engine 
the last adjustment have be make and everything be in readiness on the machine that be to carry lieutenant richard merrill one of the first american aviator to pilot a french plane into a country far beyond the border of france on one of the most dangerous mission -PRON- have ever attempt 
with a smile and a careless wave of -PRON- hand at the other member of -PRON- squadron -PRON- climb into the cockpit and adjust -PRON- helmet 
for half a second -PRON- fumble with the strap then reach for the stick 
the note of the engine deepen 
a tempest of air sweep backwards and the last restraining block be kick from beneath the wheel 
the plane roll forward gathering momentum at every yard 
an oncoming wind bear down upon -PRON- as though to beat -PRON- back 
the engine throb answer the singing noise through the fuselage 
the wing dip backward into the tooth of the gale breast -PRON- and with a graceful spiral climb swiftly into the upper strata 
high and higher -PRON- soar in everwidene circle until -PRON- become but a speck in the clear sky then -PRON- be go 
that be the last that be ever see of lieutenant richard merrill 
the official record now on file in washingfton show that -PRON- leave the french aerial base at mollincourte on october under order to make certain observation 
for this work -PRON- carry a long range telescopic camera chart of specific area to be cover and a supply of oil and petrol sufficient for twentyfour hour of sustained flight 
at the time merrill leave i have be employ on the paris staff of the new york herald and -PRON- have be warm friend 
merrill be one of those man who seem to spring from nowhere possess few friend and no relative 
-PRON- be and be now list as miss 
nothing be ever find of the plane in which -PRON- take off on that thirteenth day of october 
for several year follow -PRON- disappearance the know one argue that the machine have go far from be concede by science that the atmosphere of the earth extend only about mile and even from the level on upwards the atmosphere become so tenuous that -PRON- would be impossible to sustain human life even for an instant 
as be wellknown the aviator can no longer breathe comfortably even at such a comparatively low and dense level as seven mile above the surface of the earth 
without oxygen therefore -PRON- would be impossible to go high than seven or eight mile 
if on the other hand some extremely large or extremely dense celestial body with an atmosphere of -PRON- own should come near to the earth -PRON- would not be impossible to have the two atmosphere mingle 
then indeed -PRON- would become possible for an aviator to fly from -PRON- world to the other one 
a body make of neutronium for example which weigh pound per cubic inch nee not be very large to have a weight sufficient to attract an object in the earth atmosphere -PRON- chedifle course and have drop into the sea 
other have point out the possibility of -PRON- and fall to the earth in flame thereby make identification impossible 
prisoner have long since be exchange bring back many that be long think dead 
lieutenant merrill however be not among -PRON- nor be there any record to show that -PRON- ever have be a prisoner 
obviously then if the know one be right 
lieutenant merrill have merely meet death in a manner unknown 
this may have end the matter have not something entirely unforeseen develop in the fall of which enshroud -PRON- disappearance with a cloud of doubt and give rise to a series of perplex question to which i be unable to find sane and reasonable answer 
lieutenant disappearance form a chapter of unknown and unpublished experience in the history of aviation 
-PRON- be a mystery with an explanation but barely plausible even among present day scientist 
-PRON- fail to conform with the law of -PRON- universe and thus -PRON- raise more doubt and more question 
briefly two year after takeoff from the airdrome in france a diary write by no other than the miss man be pick up by a farmer in western iowa 
while the write word of the airman give a partial explanation of -PRON- predicament -PRON- also give rise to a series of perplex question 
how the book could have reach the earth again while man and machine remain beyond the pull of gravity be a thing that cloud the mystery rather than clear -PRON- 
the diary be wrap in leather evidently cut from the coat and weight to a stone 
i say stone for the lack of a well word to properly define the nature of this peculiar substance 
-PRON- be in size only a pebble but -PRON- weigh over two hundred pound 
a chemical analysis of a small part of -PRON- disclose helium uranium and small quantity of radium 
other metal of unfamiliar origin form the bulk of the mass 
the possession of this curious stone be the only tangible evidence aside from the diary that can be offer as proof of the strange adventure of lieutenant merrill 
through the of the local authority the book be forward to -PRON- at the press headquarters at new york city -PRON- name have be find on the wrapping 
i be not an astronomer and -PRON- knowledge of -PRON- solar system be limit 
i do not attempt to explain the entry make by this airman in the daily 
record of -PRON- terrible experience 
by all mean i be not a spiritualist and i do not believe in receive message from the dead 
the actual account as write come from a courageous man who hold on when all hope have be abandon 
if -PRON- be now dead science have lose the key to one of the dark secret of the universe 
the content of -PRON- diary therefore i be present in -PRON- original form without comment 
diary ctober -PRON- be some hour after leave the ground with the wind swinge past -PRON- in mournful cadence that the first premonition of come disaster come over -PRON- 
i struggle to fight -PRON- off know that -PRON- would get -PRON- in the end if i didnot conquer -PRON- while in the air 
to help overcome this fear i fasten -PRON- diary near -PRON- to record impression 
for a long time -PRON- fear be groundless until in the far off haze of distance a tiny speck dot the thin air 
-PRON- come nearer and nearer and i recognize the outline of an enemy plane 
the minute pass quickly 
soon -PRON- be above -PRON- far up 
the marking of the black cross be now plainly visible 
i recognize -PRON- as a german fokker and -PRON- be maneuver around to get on -PRON- tail 
i have set -PRON- course on a sharp angle to avoid -PRON- and get above -PRON- 
the pilot of the other machine have start to give chase 
well let -PRON- 
i can easily avoid -PRON- if i have plenty of room 
the throttle be now way down and -PRON- be no longer gain on -PRON- 
there be a cloud bank ahead which i be head for 
once there i be safe 
the air be grow cold with each pass minute 
a far off crackle sound be bear to -PRON- ear 
tracer bullet burn the air behind -PRON- 
i laugh lightly and bank sharply to the left 
in an instant i realize -PRON- mistake 
-PRON- have bring -PRON- closer to the other plane 
the whine of steeljacketed bullet through the fuselage cause -PRON- to bank almost vertically to the right 
another fusillade follow 
the machine be now climb like a rocket climb faster and steep than -PRON- have ever go before 
a heavy bank of cloud envelop -PRON- and i breathe a sigh of relief 
the anxious moment drag 
will the other flyer come through after -PRON- 
above the cloud at last 
the fokker be no longer in sight 
i start to push the stick forward and find -PRON- immovable 
i jerk -PRON- with all -PRON- strength but the plane refuse to return to a lateral line of travel forward 
this be annoying but i manage to keep -PRON- head 
since the plane be head upward nothing can happen so long as the engine revolve 
in the meantime i crawl back to see the extent of the damage 
-PRON- heart pound sickeningly 
the lever be hopelessly jammed and impossible to get at 
one of the control rod be break 
again and again i tug at the stubborn lever feverishly now for i realize that if i be go to reach the ground alive i must have some kind of control of the machine 
but all -PRON- attemp to straighten the machine be futile 
-PRON- be climb steadily upward 
anxiously i recall past experience for some way out of -PRON- dilemma 
nothing suggest -PRON- 
i be imprison in a hurtling machine which no longer can be control 
the thought be horrify 
be -PRON- not for this diary i think i should go insane 
i have no chute with -PRON- and even if i do have i would probably land on the wrong side of the line and remain a prisoner for the rest of the war 
vision of past experience flit before -PRON- in kaleidoscopic array 
i find -PRON- shiver 
the involuntary act bring -PRON- back to -PRON- sense 
-PRON- be grow bitter cold 
the air be change and become with each minute more rare and -PRON- be difficult to breathe 
the heavily encase fly suit be keep -PRON- body warm but -PRON- hand and face be blue from the cold 
i look anxiously at the altimeter 
a white frost have form on the glass panel make reading of -PRON- an impossibility 
unable to stand the cold any longer i cut down on the gas 
in half a second the plane have start in a tail spin 
the swiftness of the descent almost take -PRON- breath away 
this will never do 
-PRON- be death to keep on upward and equally dangerous to fall back to the earth 
between the two i have a choice and take -PRON- 
i pull the throttle clear down and keep -PRON- there 
the plane come out of the spin and once more mount steadily into the upper void 
writing have become a dreary task 
blood be pound in -PRON- head and pour from -PRON- nose 
i be begin to feel nauseated and sick 
-PRON- eye be heavy as if i hadnot sleep for week 
i want to close -PRON- and drift off into a peaceful rest that will at least remove the terror of the unknown into which i be head 
the earth be now bury with cloud and vapor 
i have completely lose -PRON- bearing 
still the plane be hurl -PRON- upwards 
for the past two hour i have write nothing 
with considerable difficulty i have pull the oxygen mask over -PRON- head and attach -PRON- to the coupling on the tank 
but the pressure be get low every minute 
the tank hadnot be full to start with carelessness 
no matter 
-PRON- wonot make much difference in a little while 
slowly a heavy drowsiness overpower -PRON- 
-PRON- will to keep awake be weaken 
no longer do i feel the pain in -PRON- frostbitten hand and face 
a delightful warmth steal over -PRON- 
this be the beginning of the end pleasant anyway not suffer 
no longer can i shake off the feeling sinking go down into oblivion farther and farther into eternity i be lose october i come to -PRON- sense with the sun shine full on -PRON- face and burn into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- whole body ache from the cramp quarter into which i be strap 
a peculiar humming noise fill the air a weird pulsing throb that seem to soothe -PRON- sluggish mind 
the meaning of -PRON- do not come to -PRON- for some time 
then to -PRON- amazement i find -PRON- be the sound of the motor which be still turn over 
strange how curious everything seem 
look around and over the edge of -PRON- seat i gaze into emptiness 
simply that 
as far as -PRON- eye can see nothing but cloud and the sun 
suddenly the cloud open up below -PRON- and the earth be once more visible but oh how far away 
i be travel into the sheer void of sky and heaven 
lean towards the altimeter which the warm sun have again render visible by melt the frost i find the needle stationary at the high reading on the instrument 
mechanically i note the speed of the plane travel 
during the night -PRON- must have pick up considerable for -PRON- be now go close to five hundred mile an hour with no additional effort or strain of power 
the wind be singe through the fuselage like the drone of a thousand bee 
faster and faster skim the plane 
the air resistance must be practically nil or else the machine be be carry onwards by some invisible trade wind 
i look again at the instrument board 
the instrument be all out of kilter the needle vary from minute to minute 
the pointer on the fuel tank show that i must have be unconscious for many hour 
i have no desire for food although i be supply with a considerable amount of hard tack and several can of beef 
be this strange buoyancy upset -PRON- desire for food or be -PRON- the result of nerve 
i be inclined to favor the latter for -PRON- mind seem strangely alert 
impression be clear and distinct 
yet a kind of a new sense seem to be make -PRON- feel indistinct and ethereal 
be i destine by an unkind fate to remain always away from the earth like a separate solar body 
the thought make -PRON- laugh aloud 
this be folly i think 
i be dream all this 
a nightmare pure and simple 
yet if -PRON- be a bad dream there seem no way of arouse -PRON- 
-PRON- eye be open and i can see 
cloud be far below -PRON- 
i can see the blaze orb of the sun and feel -PRON- heat 
one by one i examine the dial on the instrument board 
i feel of -PRON- hand -PRON- face and -PRON- heavily clothe body 
i hear the exhaust of the motor and the whirl of the propeller 
no i be not dream 
-PRON- sense be never more acute beyond the earth a will thought of fear have leave -PRON- 
by now i must be near the last barrier that surround the earth the edge of the envelope of atmosphere that cover and in a measure protect -PRON- planet 
at the present rate of gas consumption -PRON- flight will last but a short time for the gas be low 
after that -PRON- will be useless to hope for anything to happen 
i try shut down on the throttle and to -PRON- astonishment the present speed continue 
by some strange phenomenon the plane seem to move along at the same speed regardless of how much gas i give the motor 
here be a point worth consider 
be i get beyond the pull of gravity 
no -PRON- canot be yet the evidence be clear 
this last thought be too much 
-PRON- frighten -PRON- and -PRON- hand tremble so that i can no longer write 
-PRON- be now evening or so -PRON- would seem accord to -PRON- watch which by good fortune i have keep go 
but there be no darkness a strange paradox of nature 
i mention this to bring out a striking departure from one of -PRON- most natural law that bring darkness and daylight to the earth every twenty four hour with a regularity that have never be break 
but no the mistake be mine 
-PRON- be get dark but -PRON- be hour later than on earth 
yes -PRON- be get dark by the minute 
with the passing of time the air resistance decrease 
in fact there seem to be none at all now 
the motor be act queerly 
evidently the gas be about go 
i donot know what will happen if -PRON- stop 
probably nothing at all 
in all probability the powerful air current that be carry -PRON- along will continue indefinitely 
in spite of the terrific speed of the machine i suffer no ill effect and breathe quite normally 
-PRON- body be cramp from be strap in one position for so long a time and i hesitate to try move about 
slowly the hour drag along 
i have switch on the light over the instrument board in order to see 
after a time i begin to grow sleepy again 
the air be slightly cool 
all around -PRON- be the star and to the left hang a ragged moon 
october i be not sure about -PRON- date for during that awful period that i lose consciousness everything be a blank but i be try to keep -PRON- approximately straight 
morning have come again the second morning in the ill fated plane 
hunger return and i eat sparingly of -PRON- ration and wash -PRON- down with water from -PRON- canteen 
long and anxiously have i turn -PRON- binocular all about -PRON- in search of something to break the terrible monotony of space 
after what appear an eternity i have make out a dark spot that show directly in the path in which the machine be move 
and so i sit and wait for i know not what 
gradually with the passing of weary hour the spot begin to grow large 
the earth be still below -PRON- yet hardly visible through the haze 
i gaze again at the rapidly approach dark spot 
what can -PRON- be 
be -PRON- possible that -PRON- be some form of the sun asteroid or be -PRON- a wander comet 
once again the premonition of the unreal come over -PRON- 
what would happen if i collide with -PRON- 
i have hear that these strange sky visitor travel at a tremendous velocity through space in -PRON- journey around the earth 
but -PRON- canot be 
comet and other wanderer of the air be hundred of thousand of mile from the earth 
perhaps -PRON- be but a figment of -PRON- imagination put -PRON- from -PRON- mind and not think about -PRON- 
alas the sight of that dark speck attract -PRON- eye like a magnet 
i can not see or think of anything else 
i be fully prepared to wait and see 
the afternoon be nearly go accord to -PRON- watch 
if -PRON- present speed continue i should be very near -PRON- sometime tomorrow 
ahead of -PRON- and a little to the right the great orb of the sun show 
and to the left of -PRON- float the dark body which may or may not mean the end 
if i hit -PRON- the machine and i will be smash to tiny bit 
if i miss -PRON- the chance be that continue to travel endlessly into space 
four hour have pass and i have become exceedingly tired 
the speck in the far distance have steadily grow large and large 
-PRON- loom before the path of the hurtle machine like an opening cut through the sky lead out of -PRON- solar system toward the sun and planet of other world 
be i on the verge of a wonderful discovery or be i see a reflect image from a world beyond -PRON- sight 
why i should continue to write in this diary i can not tell 
somehow i feel that -PRON- act as a barrier between -PRON- and the great unknown into which i be plunge 
-PRON- seem to be the one thing that link -PRON- to the world i be lose from i must have drop to sleep 
a curious rocking motion bring -PRON- upright to a startling discovery 
during the intervene hour and -PRON- must have be many for -PRON- watch have stop the machine have speed straight towards the wanderer of the sky and even now hover over the dark mass 
anxiously i peer over the edge of the cockpit and seem to make out hill and valley with dark splotch that look like some form of vegetation 
a new land -PRON- onrushe air no longer sing past -PRON- 
i seem to have strike a pocket where force seem of no avail where all thing die through loss of motion where the law -PRON- call nature fail to hold up 
i have pass beyond the borderland of the earth and into the fastness of another world 
for a moment -PRON- heart well up within -PRON- at the mystery of the force about -PRON- 
below -PRON- stretch a new land wait to take -PRON- in and give -PRON- rest but never to give -PRON- up 
oh i realize during these moment as the machine drop lower and low that i can never leave this fragment of a lose world into which i be slowly descend 
i feel that i have pass the power station of the earth and reach by a long long flight the one place where ship do not pass where man never come out and beyond the invisible line that mark the last world outpost into interplanetary space where new world begin where gravity end 
october not know how long i last sleep i have lose track of the exact date 
i think -PRON- must be the 17th but i be not sure 
-PRON- be hard to describe in a clear and understandable manner -PRON- odd experience during the past few hour 
in fact -PRON- seem quite useless now that i be totally and forever lose from -PRON- fellow man 
word fail to express the terrible loneliness that grip -PRON- heart 
i feel like an alien soul toss about in a strange land 
and that be precisely what i be 
the plane lie on -PRON- side in a small ravine twisted and break 
miraculously i escape unhurt from the fall which by the way be not as bad as i have anticipate owe to the small force of gravity this small world have upon the fall plane 
i have wonder why the force of gravity do not smash -PRON- and -PRON- plane to bit 
the only conclusion i can reach be that for the great part of -PRON- travel the gravitational force of this little world be almost balance by that of the earth 
i have eat and quench -PRON- thirst and stretch -PRON- cramped muscle 
and now with the diary still before -PRON- i will try to record as accurately as possible the strange thing that exist on this faraway plce -PRON- first experience be in jump from the edge of the cockpit to the ground 
if -PRON- have ever see a motion picture take with an ultrarapid lens so that when show on the screen at normal speed the moving object leap and fall in a slow and lazy manner -PRON- will understand exactly how i reach the ground 
the jump be effortless 
-PRON- be as though i drift downward 
i start to walk around the plane and find -PRON- continually on the tip of -PRON- toe as though i be tread on air 
-PRON- have become necessary for -PRON- to take long stride when i walk jump lightly as i do 
the feeling be of course exhilarate 
i soon find i could cover an immense amount of ground and still scarcely exert -PRON- 
what i take for vegetation prove nothing more than highly color rock that upon examination appear to be semiprecious stone 
i have however find a few flower unlike anything i have ever see in -PRON- life 
-PRON- be of a strange iridescent hue with transparent leave and stalk 
there may be vegetation here but i havenot explore much 
the land -PRON- be nearly level with slight undulation that can scarcely be call hill 
i have find a spring of clear water and that be all 
upon look over bit of earth and rock i find new substance 
the stone be remarkable for -PRON- luminous quality and quite heavy 
i do find one that look like a sapphire but unlike the usual stone be extremely light 
upon toss -PRON- away i experience anew the low pull of gravity 
i have throw -PRON- lightly and to -PRON- amazement -PRON- have travel a hundred yard 
i try the experiment again with another stone of similar weight 
this one i throw with some force 
that be the last i ever see of -PRON- 
-PRON- simply float away in the distance 
even as i write this i can scarce credit -PRON- sense with a world so small that -PRON- seem more artificial than real 
-PRON- make -PRON- feel that the whole experience be a gigfantic hoax and that i shall presently awaken and find -PRON- the victim of a wild nightmare 
however strange as -PRON- may seem -PRON- be all too real 
on the top of the high point i have make a temporary shelter of the rock which prove quite simple consider how easy -PRON- be to lift huge boulder and lie -PRON- wherever i want -PRON- without any trouble 
nature be again at work 
-PRON- be fast grow dark bring immense relief to -PRON- tired eye 
one by one the light of the star shine through the dim vault from above 
-PRON- seem very near and friendly tonight bring -PRON- some measure of contentment 
as i stand here in the midst of immensity look out into infinite space the vision appal -PRON- 
across the clear terrestrial sky be multitude of glitter light faint and effervescent the twilight of other world 
these then must always be -PRON- companion -PRON- one solace on this faroff fragment of a broken world 
near the end day have come 
i have put off the del press thought of last night and begin a systematic survey of -PRON- new home 
if i be to remain here i must be prepare for a long stay 
from what observation i have make and -PRON- poor knowledge of mathematic i should judge -PRON- little planet be but a few hundred mile in diameter 
from what i can conclude from -PRON- knowledge i believe life be possible as long as the planet remain in -PRON- present orbit 
until early evening i ponder -PRON- chance for continue existence in this remote place since -PRON- be clearly impossible for -PRON- to return to the world of war and man 
war 
i have forget -PRON- 
how far away -PRON- seem now 
-PRON- uniform the silver bar on -PRON- shoulder -PRON- commission as a lieutenant in the aviation trade -PRON- all for a good cup of coffee 
i have just finish the last entry in the diary when a sudden shuddering jar as of a headon collision shake the planet 
-PRON- be hour afterward now as i write 
how many i can not guess lend subterranean action be fast shake -PRON- stronghold to piece the ground be open up in black twisting seam from which a choke gaseous vapor be come out in strangle cloud a flash of violethue fire follow closely by a thunderous rumbling roar cause the tiny planet to lurch violently on -PRON- axis 
the ground be heave and tremble from some inward strain 
a blind glare of vivid light follow by a crunching as of earth and rock be slowly pulverize from the powerful force beneath mark the beginning of the end 
i can feel -PRON- in every fibre of -PRON- body 
how i can remain in one position and write i do not know 
run away will do no good 
all i can hope for be to keep -PRON- head and observe something that no mortal have ever before see 
the noise increase with each pass minute 
-PRON- be like the sullen booming of a thousand gun 
the fissure be open wide 
the planet seem to be separate 
each pass moment find the air more oppressive 
cloud of vapor hover close to the ground 
all the light form of mineral be fast be precipitate off and outward from the whirl tumbling mass into space 
i have wedge -PRON- between two enormous boulder to keep -PRON- from leave the ground 
the rumble deep and thunderous be shake -PRON- so that i can hardly write 
overhead the air be fill with fly missile be throw into space 
complete and instant destruction be not far off 
flash of scarlet and green be break with the violet 
cough and strangle from the poison air i be begin to grow weak 
i be write -PRON- last few word for the outside world in hope that -PRON- will fall into the hand of someone who the ground be disintegrate beneath -PRON- -PRON- be melt scorch blast of flame be shoot skyward 
no longer can i god help -PRON- the rock be run like molten wax -PRON- be burn -PRON- alive merciful god so end the diary of lieutenant richard merrill a strange and unbelievable document of human experience 
from the paris morning journal 
le matin i have cut out a clipping that appear on the morning follow the fifth day of -PRON- disappearance 
on october 12th a new and unknown sky wanderer be observe low on the northwestern horizon 
-PRON- approach to the earth be so close as to seem almost a part of -PRON- 
the comet or asteroid be visible but a short timie on two evening 
that -PRON- escape general notice be due to heavy cloud that hang in the sky about -PRON- 
sometime later a process of disintegration be plainly observe in the early evening 
when next look for no trace of -PRON- could be find 
this item of news have no particular significance at the time to anyone 
-PRON- receive merely a pass notice in a few paper 
the appearance of the visitor and disappearance may be but a coincidence 
but if this astronomer report be true the coincidence be startling and lend a certain actual proof to the strange scrawled word in the unfortunate man diary 
the end 
i -PRON- like this magazine -PRON- must be interested in sciencefiction 
this be the case be sure to get the september issue of the sister magazine of air wonder story 
science wonder story be the great sciencefiction magazine in print nothing can compare with -PRON- 
nearly all of the author who contribute to air wonder story also contribute to wonder story 
science wonder story be dramatizedmechanic 
just as air wonder story mirror the future of aviation so wonder story mirror the future of the whole of civilization and express the trend of the world scientific progress 
if -PRON- be interested in aeronautic do not fail to read by captain hermann noordung berlin a series of article be now run in relate to space flying 
space fly no longer be merely fiction 
in europe particularly in germany serious effort be now be make by lead german engineer to make space fly outside of the earth a possibility 
captain noordung one of the foremost german engineer have invent some remarkable new instrumentality to make space fly possible 
be sure to read these wonderfully illuminate and prophetic article fail to read the announcement on page of this issue 
-PRON- lay over wall street and the gondola be lower telephone communication give -PRON- direction 
-PRON- have strew bomb all about the district so that gas cloud wreathe in the street 
what have go before a series of daring robbery have siartlea america three wall street hank haty be rob of million in gold by a mysterious raider and the financial district put to sleep 
an ocean liner be also rob of gold and later a bank in louisville ky 
jame boon an inventor of a new airplane and son of one of the new york become interested in the mystery and interest -PRON- friend dan lamont a scientist 
-PRON- conclude that the raider operate from a great speedy airship 
boon have make the acquaintance of almeric pluscarden deputy gov ernor of the bank of england and -PRON- pretty niece kirsteen torrance 
at the request of -PRON- father -PRON- fly pluscarden back to england in -PRON- speedy airplane the the bank of england be rob by the vandal million in gold steal and the ledger destroy by acid 
then come news of the invasion of the reichsbank in berlin where security and ledger be destroy and a few hour later the bank of france be enter and million in gold be leave there as well as a supply of radium 
as always the district surround the robbery be till with a gas that put people to sleep and have the ability to tarnish gold 
-PRON- also have the quality of stop the action of gasoline engine 
in ti pari invasion the first sight of the robber ship be have a gigantic airship which accord to calculation must have an amasing speed 
believe that the world be face with a reign of terror from the robber or robber 
boon return to america to arouse -PRON- country to fight -PRON- 
-PRON- see the president who be kirsteen uncle and with dan lamont be commission in the secret to hunt the robber 
hearing of robbery off the coast of africa -PRON- start out with a plane to fight the raider and after much searching meet -PRON- 
but -PRON- bullet do little harm to the airship wih be surround py a hose and the plane motor go dead 
the airship which call -PRON- ark of the covenant escape 
-PRON- believe that -PRON- have -PRON- base in morocco and call upon the nation to concentrate -PRON- airfleet there 
continue futile search i answer to the radio -PRON- send from mogador the international scout come flock to the african coast 
indeed -PRON- be no sooner at the place than the forerunner of the crowd come after -PRON- bring along by the news of -PRON- fight 
-PRON- come in a big fanshape move that in -PRON- opinion must inevitably have catch the airship have -PRON- double back across the atlantic 
there be little doubt in -PRON- mind after size the thing up with milliken that -PRON- and i have do some damage to the airship with -PRON- shellfire 
-PRON- have put in enough stuff to have fire -PRON- if hydrogen have be use in -PRON- ballonet so -PRON- be pretty clear that -PRON- lift be get from helium 
in the face of the amazingly quick getaway the raider have make after the engagement this be puzzle 
from -PRON- length which milliken and i agree be about two hundred metre and from -PRON- other measurement the total fix weight of the ship be somewhere round thirtyfour thousand kilo 
use helium -PRON- could not have a disposal lift of much more than perhaps fifteen thousand 
when the weight of -PRON- crew fuel and armament be take into account not much margin be leave for carry extra gas in liquid form 
so -PRON- reckon that -PRON- puncturing of -PRON- must have cause a lot of leakage and that -PRON- spectacular ascent must have exhaust a good portion of -PRON- reserve gas 
-PRON- conclude from this that -PRON- could not have have far to go to -PRON- base and that -PRON- would have to travel ultimately at a low altitude which make -PRON- unlikely that the patrol make for the african coast would have miss sight of -PRON- have -PRON- be make across the atlantic 
altogether the three of -PRON- work -PRON- out that -PRON- be justify in believe the airship to be conceal somewhere in the hinterland of the barbary coast and that -PRON- would venture out again when the damage -PRON- have do to -PRON- be make good 
-PRON- in the merlin with number of the international scout work on this notion and venture far into the desert but without find any reward for -PRON- searching 
a cordon of scout be fling round the coast from the canary right into the mediterranean 
on the wednesday follow -PRON- fight with the airship radio message be pick up that tell of raid on shipping to the north of the bahama 
the temptation then be to go chase off in that direction but -PRON- hold back pin -PRON- belief to the idea that -PRON- particular airship be berth somewhere in africa and that -PRON- be only a matter of patience before one or other of the plane round the coast come upon -PRON- 
personally the news of the raid in the western atlantic only confirm -PRON- belief that the organization be big enough to have basis on both side of the hemisphere 
-PRON- lay on and off the coast of africa for ten day without any luck and for several reason i make up -PRON- mind to make for home via london 
first i want to see sir thomas basildon with whom -PRON- liad be in constant communication since leave washington 
dan have send -PRON- a long report embody -PRON- idea of the mean use by the raider for upset the engine of attack plane and outline a possible way of circumvent the strange weapon 
already assistant in new york have drawing of a protective arrangement design for the merlin and i be anxious to give the thing a trial and to have -PRON- try out on other machine 
-PRON- be an elaborate cage arrangement of metallic conductor lead to a series of condenser and -PRON- be mean to collect the suppose electric ray before -PRON- reach the engine and to disperse -PRON- harmlessly 
in the matter -PRON- come toward the final chapter of this great air story in -PRON- belief that have be print so far -PRON- be approach the good part of the story 
-PRON- be quite certain that the denouement be quite different from what -PRON- expect 
and when -PRON- learn the amazing secret that lie behind the mysterious ark of the covenant -PRON- believe -PRON- will applaud the author for the wonderful idea -PRON- be base on make the world a well place to live in 
and let no one think that the scientific instrument which the author use be either improbable or impossible 
sooner or later -PRON- will have the weapon so finely conceive by -PRON- and -PRON- do hope when -PRON- have -PRON- that the inventor or inventor who bring -PRON- into the world will take as lofty attitude as the chief of the gas however by some unfortunate mischance in landing whether by a wave or otherwise bottle apparatus for sample the anaesthetic have be smash on the day of -PRON- fight and -PRON- be without a sample for analysis much to -PRON- and -PRON- chagrin 
secondly as a reason for go home via london i have hear that lord almeric be intend another visit to america and i think if -PRON- could make -PRON- arrangement suit -PRON- would be a good notion to take -PRON- over on the merlin 
i radio to sir thomas tell -PRON- to expect -PRON- and on the thursday evening dan and i be closet with -PRON- and lord almeric in the room at scotland yard 
the chief of the british have not waste any time -PRON- find 
-PRON- have badger the authority into fit up -PRON- plane with airtight body and supply -PRON- with oxygen and -PRON- have have instrumentmaker set to the task of turn out protective apparatus 
-PRON- discussion with -PRON- and -PRON- description of the fight help to clear up some point that have be puzzle -PRON- 
-PRON- come away from scotland yard in the knowledge that -PRON- visit there have not be a waste of time 
from lord almeric -PRON- hear that business in britain be at a standstill and that factory and commercial house be close down all over the country 
price in the stock market be low than -PRON- have ever be good industrial security which have be regard as next to giltedge be sell at price that make -PRON- look like wildcat oil stock 
the damage to the country in lose trade represent million 
lord almeric declare and the setback would be feel long after the raider be scotch 
the state of affair be out of all proportion to the damage do actually in the raid and could only be attribute to a kind of panic 
as a result of the london raid and of the affair in the house of common the government have fall 
-PRON- have be laugh out of office though ostensibly -PRON- fall be due to a defeat on some quite unimportant measure 
the press devote column to the raid now and print the opinion of wise man foolish man wellknown man obscure man of how the outrage be carry out and how -PRON- could be stop with fantastic theory on both side 
-PRON- be even suggest that the raider have come from mar 
the change of tone from the time of the new york raid be to say the least of -PRON- remarkable 
unobtrusively as -PRON- have make -PRON- entry into london neither dan nor i nor milliken escape the attention of the newspaper man 
-PRON- hang round -PRON- like fly infest -PRON- vicinity at meal time see -PRON- to bed and greet -PRON- on -PRON- awaking 
-PRON- be glad when at last on the saturday morning -PRON- could get lord almeric aboard and be off across the atlantic 
-PRON- make straight for washington where -PRON- passenger be to meet -PRON- father and several other banker 
-PRON- voyage be quite uneventful and placid and -PRON- arrive on the potomac basin just before seven on the saturday evening american time 
a rival i be good to get back to washington and find no only -PRON- father but kirsteen torrance wait for -PRON- on the landingstage 
four week all but a day have elapse since -PRON- set out on -PRON- venture and to -PRON- at least a shadow of failure lie on -PRON- return 
at any rate i be a little shy of meet miss level glance 
there be that in -PRON- welcome of -PRON- however after -PRON- have greet lord almeric with affection which quickly sweep away all sense of have fail 
to milliken always -PRON- favorite -PRON- have so much to say that -PRON- be at -PRON- black of countenance with embarrassed delight 
i think -PRON- would burst something 
the old man too seem to think -PRON- have not do badly 
in the casual heartiness of -PRON- greeting i think i could discern something of satisfaction of pride even at -PRON- exploit 
dinner that evening at the white house be a sort of reunion 
the president kirsteen lord almeric -PRON- father danny and -PRON- all somehow link up with the task in hand compose the party and one stranger 
this be an englishman a big fellow name seton 
now in the four week -PRON- have be away from washington i have think a good deal about kirsteen torrance and i may admit here and now that i have come back to -PRON- with an absolute certainty that life without -PRON- would for -PRON- be incomplete 
when the merlin be streak down on the airship that sunday morning -PRON- have come to -PRON- very clearly just what kirsteen stand for and that be pretty nigh everything 
i wonot elaborate on the theme leave -PRON- just so 
-PRON- be with a pang of dismay therefore that i hear commander seton introduce as an old friend of both kirsteen and lord almeric and see the satisfaction the big englishman and -PRON- have in each other company 
when a fellow find a girl interesting there s nothing can make -PRON- feel so hopeless about -PRON- chance with -PRON- as to hear -PRON- talk with another man do -PRON- remember bulk largely in the conversation 
seton and kirsteen be old enough friend for that 
-PRON- would have be a mean thing to get up any dislike of commander seton 
as -PRON- listen to the story that dan and i have to tell -PRON- become very evident that the stranger be no layman in the matter of aeronautics 
-PRON- comment be practical to a degree and -PRON- question shrewdly knowledgeable 
not only that but under the lethargy which sometimes be to be see in big man of -PRON- sort there lie a mental alertness that promise -PRON- could move -PRON- big frame with lightning quickness in an emergency 
-PRON- give an impression of be very much a man 
the only point that dan and i hold back from the general company be regard -PRON- idea for get round the electric ray of the raider 
i canot say what -PRON- be that move -PRON- to this piece of reticence unless -PRON- be just the presence of seton 
but this be the very point that the big englishman bring up later in conversation with -PRON- when kirsteen have bring -PRON- together say that -PRON- should find much in common 
that be a curious fact about all four machine be send down with engine trouble mr boon say seton yit seem indeed to point to some weapon of the kind imagine by -PRON- friend lamont 
yes say the raider -PRON- know -PRON- engine would be all right afterwards 
make -PRON- conclusive 
yes i say shortly 
be -PRON- remain long in washington commander seton 
-PRON- depend very much on circumstance -PRON- reple 
if the raider have such a ray -PRON- make -PRON- practically immune from airplane attack 
practically i agree 
i want to leave the subject 
except of course from a surprise attack on a vulnerable point from a height 
oh yes say always that 
-PRON- must be obvious to -PRON- as an airman ah say seton -PRON- know that about -PRON- do -PRON- guess -PRON- 
ordinary people do not talk of torque as -PRON- do 
come come 
a common engineering term like that -PRON- then 
-PRON- dear man i have never conceal -PRON- 
if i do there would always be who and the british navy list to give -PRON- away 
fly much these day little but i still retain an interest in the game seton say be very interested for example in this new machine of yours 
from all account -PRON- must be a wonder pretty good admit say come and see -PRON- some day should like to very much 
what day would suit if -PRON- like 
-PRON- go to -PRON- place on long island for a refit but -PRON- could see -PRON- before -PRON- start 
where be -PRON- stay 
hotel maryland like -PRON- 
then -PRON- could come down with -PRON- tomorrow 
splendid say -PRON- want to see -PRON- especially as -PRON- may be the last of the airplane 
i look at -PRON- with some amazement 
how do -PRON- get there i ask mean the last of the fighting airplane -PRON- explain 
if these raider johnny have the ray -PRON- imagine and unless some mean of protection against -PRON- can be devise the aeroplane will be of no use 
think of dirigible attack a town with bomb and crash all machine send up against -PRON- 
-PRON- power would be unlimited 
but perhaps -PRON- and lamont have devise some mean that may make the ray ineffective i look -PRON- straight in the eye and lie no i say and turn to find the president come over to -PRON- minute jimmy say the president if commander seton will excuse -PRON- 
i have be talk with dan lamont about that protective cage idea for these ray i get up with a look at the big englishman 
-PRON- be smile blandly and -PRON- shake -PRON- head at -PRON- in a way that make -PRON- feel very small for i do not know why i have fence with -PRON- all along to lie to -PRON- at the finish 
i see little of kirsteen that evening 
people drift in later and between these -PRON- uncle lord almeric seton -PRON- father and danny -PRON- be keep too busy to spare more than a brief moment or two with -PRON- 
-PRON- be from lord almeric that i hear history 
ready for action have do well for -PRON- country in the war of and have come out of the struggle with a string of initial after -PRON- name represent the high honor the ally and britain -PRON- could give -PRON- 
-PRON- fight as a sailor and as a fly man and in the latter branch have handle both aeroplane and dirigible 
towards the end of the war -PRON- have go back to sailore and have finally retire with the rank of commander 
-PRON- then take up business in london city and in the year have amass -PRON- be say a fortune of half a million british pound sterling 
with this behind -PRON- -PRON- desert the city and begin to indulge a passion for exploration often be absent from england for month on end 
-PRON- be now back 
lord almeric think after over a year absence 
seton come to see -PRON- off to gardiner bay on sunday afternoon and -PRON- have great praise for the merlin 
-PRON- be the only airman who ever inspect the machine who grasp the principle of the hover arrangement straight off 
there be something about the big fellow that move -PRON- to a sincere admiration of -PRON- but i do hate to see -PRON- stand with kirsteen as -PRON- fly off 
i know -PRON- would be day before i could get back to washington and i be leave -PRON- a clear field with the girl 
still i have -PRON- job to do and in the face of that personal matter have to stand aside 
-PRON- have to fit the merlin up with apparatus and go over every screw and pin of -PRON- 
-PRON- have be fly for over a month with no more overhauling than milliken and -PRON- could give -PRON- with the help of chance mechanic 
-PRON- be due to be take down and set up again by man who understand -PRON- if -PRON- high efficiency be to be maintain 
-PRON- put dan ashore at the battery landingstage on the sunday evening so that -PRON- could go straight to -PRON- laboratory then -PRON- go on to gardiner bay where -PRON- find every man jack of the workshop hand wait to see -PRON- arrive 
-PRON- be -PRON- day of rest and since -PRON- departure -PRON- have be work at top speed on the making of machine from the merlin design but the boy have always be keen 
-PRON- be more than just pay hand 
anyhow the cheer that go up when the old merlin come to rest by the jetty may have be hear in new york 
nothing would suit -PRON- but that i should tell the whole bunch of -PRON- collect in the erection shed the full story of -PRON- tossup with the airship 
on the monday dan lamont turn up with two intenselooke assistant and a carload of material 
-PRON- hand over to the three of -PRON- a small draftingoffice where -PRON- immediately become happy in an outrageous tangle of wire and blue print 
i tell dan i think -PRON- be a messy gang but by the time -PRON- have the merlin overhaul and wait to be put togrther again -PRON- and the solemn pair be on the mat with a neat cage affair and a string of black box all ready for fit inside the engine cover 
by thursday evening -PRON- be prepare for -PRON- second sally against the enemy and i have great hope that fixment would give -PRON- a well fighting chance 
-PRON- arrive in washington early on the friday forenoon and almost the first person dan and i meet there be commander seton 
-PRON- run into -PRON- in the foyer of the hotel 
hullo boon 
hullo lamont say -PRON- just the very man i be hope to see off for the south at three oclock and i want -PRON- to lunch witlr -PRON- 
miss torrance be come and lord almeric if -PRON- can get away 
why sure say dan right off 
very glad to delighted i say 
where and when

i only mean i have a hunch well meet in the most unlikely place sometime 
that evening a message in the name of the president of the united state be broadcast on the wave length use by the mysterious airship to the airship ark of the covenant with what object be these raid make on humanity 
whitcomb president of the united state of america 
station all round the atlantic shore on -PRON- side and in europe take up the message and repeat -PRON- 
every three hour the message go out 
saturday come and pass 
sunday pass 
and still the message be repeat 
news of the message germinate from a chance remark at a luncheon party get into the newspaper 
-PRON- be feature with stare headline and the people wait in breathless expectancy for the reply for most of the journal promise a special edition immediately the news come through 
danny and i wait that sunday night in the white house while milliken stand by with the merlin 
midnight come and the president still stubbornly believe that the message would come 
i think of go down to the basin and turn in on -PRON- boat ready to take the air as soon as the word come through the aerodrome radio 
but mr whitcomb would not hear of -PRON- 
there would be no delay -PRON- promise -PRON- and if -PRON- care to sleep -PRON- would have the servant make -PRON- up a shakedown apiece 
but i be not think of sleep for -PRON- 
i be think of sleep for the president and for a kirsteen who share -PRON- vigil 
now i would have the situation realize to the full 
every radio station on the shore of the atlantic wait for the message that may come from the raider and every one would take -PRON- with the directional detector open 
-PRON- be a trap of sort 
some hundred of station would pick up the message and behind these station plane lie ready to take the air to the place whence the message emanate 
-PRON- be too much to hope that the raider would reply from a base 
none would know well than -PRON- the danger that lie in do so 
but -PRON- be hope that -PRON- know daring would tempt -PRON- to reply from the airship not realize perhaps the extent of the secret preparation that have be make for -PRON- next appearance 
-PRON- may chance that -PRON- would reply from the middle of an encircling ring which would at once close down on -PRON- 
one oclock on monday morning and still -PRON- wait 
the hand of the clock slowly creep round to the halfhour and the chime bell out half an old lutheran hymn tune 
the vibration of the last unsatisfying note still hang in the air when a knock come to the door 
-PRON- be a messenger with a radio flimsy in -PRON- hand read -PRON- aloud say the president 
god bless -PRON- and give -PRON- mercy listen relay from the pershe message begin regret to report total company of the ship render unconscious between the hour simday monday 
follow message find in radio cabin address to president whitcomb quote message begin to the president of the united state of america from the airship ark of the covenant to stop war 
quote message end position relay message end 
a gasp go up from -PRON- little company 
then silence 
to stop war the president repeat at last worthy object indeed piracy robbery the world commerce and trade bring to chaos to stop war 
what visionarie what madman be these 
shrewd madman 
i exclaim 
by this time -PRON- be six hundred kilometre from the position of the pershing 
-PRON- may have know 
not peace but a sword breathe mr whitcomb 
peace by terror panic in the night 
i dart for a chart that lie on a table near by degree north degree west i cry near home if -PRON- like 
three hundred and fifty kilometre due east of this city up after -PRON- jimmy cry the president 
beat the sky for -PRON- bring -PRON- down i put -PRON- hand on -PRON- flyingcoat which lie on a couch handy and kirsteen run to help -PRON- 
just then through the open window there come a wild shrilling of whistle from the street of the city a hubbub and shouting 
transfix i stand with an arm in one sleeve of -PRON- coat the body of -PRON- hang loose in hand and -PRON- by -PRON- side staring at the window with the rest of -PRON- 
a faint explosion come from the ground outside like the bursting of an electric bulb 
quick 
i shout 
the window danny 
shut -PRON- quick 
kirsteen mr whitcomb upstairs as fast as -PRON- can to the roof but even as i spring for the door of the room i see first danny succumb to the gas then the president 
i be just in time to catch kirsteen sway as -PRON- fall 
by dint of hold -PRON- breath i manag to lower -PRON- gently on the couch then -PRON- overwrought lung give way 
i spring from tall cliff into a balanced dive down dowd into depth that be dense indigo 
the raider answer rom gross darkness i swam upwards with a sense of wellbee 
into a cavern of deep blue through cerulean and emerald into pearly grey and primrose i sweep upwards to wake with a strange exhilaration in a blaze of light 
somewhere near -PRON- clock chime bell out half an old lutheran hymn tune 
i find -PRON- huddle at foot as -PRON- lie inert on the couch in the sittingroom 
some one have throw -PRON- flyingcoat over -PRON- 
by the window now closed lie dan lamont and nearer the middle of the room with -PRON- head comfortably dispose on a pillow and with a rug throw over -PRON- the president repose 
remember i get unsteadily to -PRON- foot and as i look at the clock and see that -PRON- mark halfpast three -PRON- first thought be for kirsteen 
i take -PRON- hand and pat -PRON- gently 
-PRON- do not stir and i half strangle with a fear that -PRON- be dead 
but -PRON- be breathe softly and i leave -PRON- to cross to the president 
-PRON- awake at -PRON- touch 
what what -PRON- mutter 
what be that noise in the garden jimmy i help -PRON- to -PRON- foot remember now 
the raider 
yes sir i tell -PRON- 
-PRON- all have be asleep for two hour 
-PRON- go over to kirsteen in a dazed way while i cross to dan lamont 
the president shake the girl softly by the shoulder and as i knelt by danny i see -PRON- wake with a smile 
i shake danny wasnot smart enough jimmy -PRON- mutter too quick that dope doesnot give -PRON- a chance 
i help -PRON- to -PRON- foot 
gee jimmy -PRON- say with a faint grin be raid look like -PRON- 
i turn to the president and kirsteen and find -PRON- stand by the table in the centre of the room 
on the table lie a paper 
boy come here the president say and all four of -PRON- stand by -PRON- to read the message that lie before -PRON- 
benjamin whitcomb -PRON- run 
-PRON- ask -PRON- what object -PRON- have in make these raid on humanity 
here be -PRON- answer once more -PRON- make these raid on humanity for humanitys sake 
-PRON- object be to put an end to war on humanity 
if -PRON- as fte honest man -PRON- be know to be have a real love for humanity -PRON- will use -PRON- power and influence to further that object by whatever mean -PRON- think fit 
none know better than -PRON- know how near the nation stand to the brink of war 
until -PRON- resolve to step aside from the path that lead -PRON- to destruction -PRON- power will be use against -PRON- on land and sea 
if -PRON- have eye to see -PRON- will see 
if -PRON- have a tongue wherewith to speak -PRON- will bear witness to the nation 
that be -PRON- answer benjamin whitcomb 
look to -PRON- that -PRON- answer as straightly 
the league of the covenant 
the madness of -PRON- mutter the president 
do -PRON- think that nation can be reform by the turn of a hand and yet the bigness of -PRON- man man if i be only foreman to god almighty -PRON- break off and pace up and down the room 
-PRON- be a great object if sincere -PRON- say as if -PRON- have not be there but these be not the mean to accomplish -PRON- 
will earthly fear drive out that sin which not the fear of god can subdue 
no no 
no wrong can right another 
-PRON- be a menace a menace 
-PRON- have bring the people nearer to war than further from -PRON- 
-PRON- be a menace 
-PRON- turn to danny and -PRON- but though -PRON- look at -PRON- with blaze eye -PRON- seem to see beyond -PRON- will not turn back -PRON- say thickly 
-PRON- task remain jame boon 
find -PRON- the nest of these visionary pirate and let -PRON- test -PRON- boast power these evangelist who do not scorn to fill -PRON- pocket as -PRON- preach 
roust -PRON- -PRON- out jame boon 
-PRON- have behind -PRON- the whole of the united state 
to -PRON- -PRON- son 
yes sir i say quietly for i see with surprise that -PRON- be not -PRON- sir jimmy 
dan 
-PRON- turn to finger the paper that still lie on the table while kirsteen come with -PRON- to the door leave -PRON- uncle kirsteen i whisper 
-PRON- be not -PRON- -PRON- be better alone -PRON- reply 
-PRON- be so terribly selfwille that -PRON- hate be dictate to and -PRON- be mad with anger at the indignity of have be send to sleep 
but -PRON- s right 
the raider must be catch and punish 
dan 
good luck 
-PRON- hold out -PRON- hand to dan who grasp -PRON- for a moment then run down the step 
jimmy 
god speed -PRON- 
i retain -PRON- hand for a moment 
kirsteen 
i blurt catch -PRON- as -PRON- fall 
i know i canot do without -PRON- 
be there any chance for -PRON- 
jimmy jimmy -PRON- say gently 
-PRON- have a man task before -PRON- yet but there be that in -PRON- voice make -PRON- heart leap 
i laugh and stop to kiss -PRON- hand 
well i say a man task to tell a girl -PRON- love -PRON- 
i run down the step after dan 
theory a -PRON- make -PRON- way down to the basin on the potomac dan lamont and i come on a num -PRON- of people still lie unconscious from the gas 
-PRON- be at about the end of -PRON- sleep and the night be warm and mild so -PRON- could not come to much harm 
-PRON- do not stop therefore to attempt to bring the sleeper round 
at the landingstage everything be placid and quiet 
the arc be burn brightly and by -PRON- light -PRON- could see mechanic walk about or work here and there 
milliken be fast asleep in the cabin and when -PRON- wake -PRON- -PRON- find that no news of the raid have yet reach the aerodrome 
the message to the president have be pick up by the radio and on receipt of -PRON- several pilot have go up to make for the position give by the pershing think -PRON- be a bit like shut the stable door -PRON- say milliken see that the radio arrive over two hour after the doping of the battleship 
when -PRON- didnot turn up i think to -PRON- that the plan have be change and that -PRON- be after some other game 
so i just turn in and have a sleep 
while -PRON- be sleep milliken say washington be be raid 
-PRON- sit up at that 
jink -PRON- exclaim 
there wasnot a whisper of -PRON- round the aerodrome 
i turn to dan 
look as if the folk that make the hubbub and blew whistle just before the gas catch -PRON- must have be dope too i say 
look like -PRON- danny reply a clean getaway milliken stare 
what 
be -PRON- dope then -PRON- ask 
yes 
the attack be on the white house 
the president and miss torrance be put to sleep 
for the first time in -PRON- experience of -PRON- i see milliken grow really angry 
the blood rush to -PRON- face until -PRON- be black to the merlin but still fair enough for an airship 
look at this morning 
six hundred kilometre in two hour leg for an airship milliken insist 
here mr boon and -PRON- mr lamont just have a look at this 
this map 
i figure -PRON- like this -PRON- have dive into -PRON- locker and bring out a small scale map of the western hemisphere 
on this -PRON- have draw a complicated series of line carefully tag the longitude and latitude of each know raid 
-PRON- be an interesting piece of work and -PRON- show that old milliken be silent to some purpose if -PRON- think the more 
what do -PRON- think of -PRON- 
i ask dan 
christopher say -PRON- think get a i i i miss torrance -PRON- choke 
here after -PRON- easy milliken i check -PRON- gently 
-PRON- donot know yet which way the raider have go 
i have hope that the aerodrome know of the attack and have some idea of the direction -PRON- take 
not a scout go up sir on account of the raid -PRON- say thickly 
if only know have give -PRON- something the swine 
dope a girl like miss torrance would -PRON- 
look here mr boon mr lamont -PRON- go on presently in -PRON- normal voice be think this thing out in -PRON- own way be study the map a bit and calculate distance and that work out time too 
from what i see of the airship that day bet -PRON- have a fair pair of leg not up hot idea 
good for -PRON- milliken 
-PRON- go over the theory carefully once more checking figure 
the idea be more than feasible betting then milliken that the base be somewhere on the spanish main i say to -PRON- 
the spanish main -PRON- cry 
why so -PRON- be 
i never think of -PRON- so but so -PRON- be 
now wouldnot that be just the place for the dern pirate -PRON- be obvious that the romantic association of the old name have fire the imagination of milliken but that do not affect the attractiveness of -PRON- notion 
a feature of -PRON- be that -PRON- have work the whole thing out on the basis of one airship 
i think this point a trifle stretch -PRON- 
-PRON- be give the airship of the raider a power that be simply miraculous but even work out on the basis i hold to that the raider have station on either side of the atlantic there be a good deal in the idea 
i slap -PRON- mechanic on the back anyhow enough milliken i say head south for a start when -PRON- fling open the gate of the boatshed and float the merlin out into the basin -PRON- find that the news of the raid have get down to the airstation 
-PRON- be now a scene of wild activity 
from all direction come the hum of engine and mechanic be run about on all the platform 
when the merlin appear in the open -PRON- be immediately surround by pilot and squadron commander ask for the late news 
-PRON- news be more than -PRON- and -PRON- do not waste time in tell -PRON- how -PRON- -PRON- have be dope 
nor be -PRON- necessary to inform -PRON- of idea 
-PRON- be all under the central command and the information would only have make -PRON- restless 
-PRON- leave -PRON- alone and get ready to take off 
where be -PRON- head anyway some one shout as -PRON- swing into the beam of light which give -PRON- -PRON- path into the wind 
-PRON- i yell in reply with a strange feeling of exhilaration 
why be head south 
contact milliken off to the spanish main the hum of the engine the merlin throb and as -PRON- mechanic climb up through the hatch -PRON- lift from the surface of the water and climb swinge south for the old spanish mainland 
-PRON- be after four in the morning when -PRON- take off from the basin and day be break as -PRON- reach fly height 
less than an hour flight leave cape lookout behind -PRON- and shortly after seven -PRON- be over the bahama 
the mass of cuba loom up on a clear horizon sometime past eight and by ten oclock dan and i be breakfast in one of the good hotel in kingston jamaica 
so -PRON- may be guess in what trim the merlin be that morning 
milliken have relapse back into -PRON- usual taciturn self and would not be persuade to join -PRON- at the hotel 
-PRON- prefer to remain behind with the merlin and cook -PRON- own breakfast on the gasoline stove 
i fancy -PRON- be a little astonished at -PRON- own eloquence in the early morning for -PRON- be certainly pile up a new record for silence 
-PRON- wake up enough however when -PRON- rejoin the merlin to plead that -PRON- rnake straight for maracaybo so redolent of association with the buccaneer 
i have have another notion than to risk the probable discomfort of the venezuelan town but i decide that maracaybo would do for a start especially as -PRON- satisfy some hide vein of romance in -PRON- robust artificer 
let the reader examine map of the north atlantic at this point and learn what a curious fellow -PRON- mechanic be 
maracaybo be -PRON- 
i say to -PRON- 
and let hope -PRON- hunch lead to another slap at this modern morgan 
-PRON- cross the caribbean without mishap in good fly weather and make maracaybo an hour after noon 
the town have a good harbor part of the landlocked lake of maracaybo excellent as a shelter for seaplane but for reason which have much to do with a personal bias to that virtue near godliness -PRON- decide to sleep on the merlin 
-PRON- have fill up with gasoline at kingston and have sufficient aboard for a fairly long flight but -PRON- be always a wise plan to keep full tank if good stuff be to be have 
here -PRON- find some difficulty 
the stuff the dago be willing enough to supply would have be too much for the digestion even of a truck 
i be for let the thing slide until -PRON- make another port but danny come out with a suggestion the matter with try old aunt mandy again -PRON- ask an idea say try -PRON- 
-PRON- hunt round until -PRON- find a general store and here sure enough -PRON- be able to buy a packet 
on the packet the name of the local agent be give and an address so -PRON- look the fellow up 
senor fernando lopez be a stout and very tired spaniard -PRON- seem at first sight a typical dago who have difficulty with english 
-PRON- be too polite to yawn in -PRON- face but -PRON- look as if -PRON- would have like to 
and -PRON- do not change a hair when i casually flash the star that be pin to the inside of -PRON- coat 
all -PRON- do be to waddle over to a door and push -PRON- open with a lazy wave of -PRON- yellow hand bid -PRON- step inside 
but once the door be close on the three of -PRON- in that inner room senor fernando lopez speak idiomatic american 
say boy -PRON- say with a quick smile mighty glad to see -PRON- the trouble 
i explain who -PRON- be and -PRON- present need 
aviation spirit say senor fernando 
sure 
so -PRON- be mr boon and mr lamont be hear about -PRON- 
glad to see -PRON- boy glad to see -PRON- 
i have be want to see -PRON- for a week or two past 
i be hope -PRON- would drop in here one day funny to hear mr lopez i say in some surprise the mere chance that bring -PRON- to maracaybo 
what make -PRON- think -PRON- may turn up sit down boy and tell -PRON- say -PRON- 
no stop a bit better be comfortable -PRON- open another door 
this lead into a courtyard a widish space with palm and flower and surround by a sort of cloister of old arch 
-PRON- be clean and sweet and cool and a surprising thing to come on after the hot and dusty narrow street from which one enter the building 
-PRON- find comfortable american recline chair in the shade and when -PRON- be pug down senor fernando clap -PRON- hand spanish fashion 
a softfooted yellow servant appear and -PRON- new friend jabber an order at -PRON- 
next moment the servant be back with a tray of glass a bottle or two and a bowl of ice wonot ask -PRON- what -PRON- will drink say fernando because i know what s best in maracaybo 
i prescribe 
-PRON- manipulate the bottle and whisk in the ice 
the result be a beautifully colored bubbling drink in each of three long glass 
bury -PRON- nose in that say senor fernando 
say boy mighty glad to see -PRON- -PRON- nod and take a long pull at -PRON- glass an example that dan and i be apt enough to follow 
i will say that senor fernando lopez could mix a drink 
and now boy tell -PRON- one of the reason why so mighty glad to see -PRON- -PRON- say apart from the fun of see -PRON- american face 
-PRON- lean forward in this chair think -PRON- be on a hot scent down here 
danny and -PRON- may be sure prick up -PRON- ear 
-PRON- mean the raider 
i ask 
-PRON- nod mysteriously 
-PRON- have a funny little trick of a backward nod that seem to call -PRON- close 
listen 
there be rumor along this coast from here right along to port of spain aye and further of an airship cross the coastline 
at first when the news come out about these raid i think -PRON- be only nigg and dago talk 
but the thing have persist be to the trouble of have the thing the rumor follow up and begin to think there s something in -PRON- 
so far only report -PRON- to headquarters as perhaps dago and nigger fiction but now well i think -PRON- would pay -PRON- to haunt this coast for a spell 
do -PRON- get -PRON- boy i have nothing definite to give -PRON- except -PRON- own opinion and that be there be something in -PRON- 
-PRON- catch fire danny and a sudden appearance dine and sleep in the house of senor fernando that night and from somewhere -PRON- host procure a supply of firstclass aviation spirit 
-PRON- own man take -PRON- down to the seaplane and milliken look after the replenishing of the tank 
in the morning with a cordial invitation to make the house of -PRON- useful friend -PRON- own whenever -PRON- be in maracaybo -PRON- set off down the coast 
for a week -PRON- haunt the sealine back and forward from maracaybo to cayenne without get wind of -PRON- quarry 
this bring -PRON- to the middle monday in june when for another week -PRON- be stormbound in maracaybo 
the hospitality of senor fernando be limitless but -PRON- enforced inactivity be very galling 
-PRON- only consolation be that if -PRON- could not take the air neither could the raider 
but by the saturday of the third week in june the tropical storm be over and again -PRON- set off down the coast of the main 
-PRON- trail along the leeward and on the sunday morning early get out from port of spain to search the less antille for -PRON- be still keen on idea 
then at eleven oclock that sunday -PRON- pick up a radio telling of an airship raid on shipping on the other side of panama 
-PRON- make right back to maracaybo where -PRON- find senor fernando to whom -PRON- have radio wait for -PRON- in the harbor with a full supply of gasoline 
-PRON- fill up and be off again come down at panama to seek information and -PRON- be tell that the raid have take place on the new zealand route off the galapagos 
these island be -PRON- next objective and -PRON- make -PRON- just on nightfall 
-PRON- be mighty tired though by this time dan be up to handle the machine and have be spell milliken and -PRON- but as -PRON- could find no safe mooring -PRON- take off again and reach guayaquil in the dark 
here -PRON- find a mooring in the roadway of the bay and -PRON- hitch to -PRON- without ask permission 
-PRON- set no watch but lie down to sleep determined to be stir with the first streak of daylight 
but when daylight come -PRON- land on a piece of bad luck 
-PRON- be just after four in the morning and milliken and i be go over the engine 
a sudden imprecation from -PRON- mechanic make -PRON- go over to the side -PRON- be examine and i see -PRON- gaze with a rueful face at the gasoline supply pipe to one of the starboard carburetor 
-PRON- be snap clean through close to the carburetor 
well i say no use make a postmortem on the thing milliken better straighten one of the coil a bit and braze a new junction 
right sir say milliken jind go to -PRON- locker for the necessary tool 
although -PRON- have fly from maracaybo to panama and from there to galapagos thence to guayaquil i be not prepared to see the gasoline gauge so low 
i conclude that there must have be a good deal of leakage from the fracture before -PRON- absolutely part and i take one of the dago boatman that be now round the plane and go ashore for a supply of the juice 
-PRON- boatman be a travel man and a linguist and i be able to make -PRON- understand what i want 
-PRON- conduct -PRON- up the quay and lead the way to a gasoline store sure enough but -PRON- be somewhere round halfpast four in the morning and there be nobody about 
the place be shut 
i be stand grumble at the luck when suddenly -PRON- dago let out a yell and begin point right above -PRON- into the sky 
see senor -PRON- cry 
look look 
the airsheep a thrill run up -PRON- spine for there high above the town like a tiny spear blade of silver in the grow light of the morning float the ark of the covenant 
i be sure of -PRON- 
there be no two ship of the same design in the world unless -PRON- belong to the raider 
-PRON- be gall i need hardly say 
there lie the merlin in the roadway with a part gasoline pipe cripple to a certain extent and with -PRON- tank more than half empty and high above -PRON- the quarry speed serene and beautiful heading straight across the ande mad as i be i have the sense to take an accurate bearing of the airship course then i fling -PRON- into a useless activity 
i yell at -PRON- dago and at the other who be gather round 
i throw money at -PRON- and make -PRON- hustle to find the man who run the gasoline station 
as good luck would have -PRON- -PRON- turn out to be a scotsman but -PRON- be fortyfive minute before -PRON- make -PRON- appearance for -PRON- live outside the town 
when -PRON- do come -PRON- come run and -PRON- be still put on -PRON- clothe as -PRON- come 
in as few word as possible i explain the situation to -PRON- 
bide a wee -PRON- say unflustered think 
i could give ye petrol frae tin in the store but yd have to manhandle -PRON- to -PRON- plane and that d take time 
no by jingo 
i have a tanker lie at the quayside bung fu o the juice 
could ye manoeuvre -PRON- boatie alongside soon have -PRON- tank u if ye can 
in pursuit -PRON- have -PRON- a scotchman any day for sense i hustle into the boat and -PRON- pull out to the merlin 
milliken have the breakage fix and -PRON- taxi the bus alongside the tanker 
in no time have a pipe and a pump fix between the tanker and the plane and in a little the tank be brim 
how much be that mr i ask 
damn if i know i didna measure -PRON- reply bother wit 
off -PRON- go man send ye a bill but -PRON- donot know anything about -PRON- i trust -PRON- for that 
off wi ye so -PRON- yell at -PRON- from the side of -PRON- tanker dance with excitement the while 
-PRON- sheer off while -PRON- wave at -PRON- and -PRON- taxi down the roadway preparatory to take off for -PRON- climb over the town 
milliken and dan have both see the airship and -PRON- confirm -PRON- idea of -PRON- direction 
soon -PRON- have leave guayaquil behind and be climb climb for -PRON- flight over the andes 
the verdure of the coastal strip pass beneath -PRON- and -PRON- rise over a still and rugge barrenness 
up up -PRON- fly nor do -PRON- flatten to level flight until over eight thousand metre be show 
bank of cloud lie far below -PRON- 
to either side and in front of -PRON- stretch the mountain -PRON- peak glow jewellike in the sun crimson saffron gold -PRON- hollow and deep canon cobalt purple indigo 
range on range -PRON- stretch scaur and hump and tooth cleft and riven moulded and hewn 
and everywhere an awful stillness a stillness that make the steady song of the seaplane seem sacrilege 
below -PRON- no bird float about -PRON- no wind stir except for the wind of -PRON- own speed through the bitter air 
all aperture of the cabin be close -PRON- have the heater on and -PRON- be breathe oxygen while compress air be be feed to the induction of the cylinder 
the speed dial stand at well over the five hundred kilometre mark and though -PRON- quarry be over an hour ahead of -PRON- -PRON- have great hope of overtake -PRON- 
time pass 
danny share the lookout with -PRON- while milliken rustle a meal to break -PRON- fast 
when -PRON- be ready -PRON- take -PRON- share before relieve dan and when dan have eat i give the control to milliken and eat last of all 
i want two pair of eye for the lookout all the time 
yet for all -PRON- vigil -PRON- come upon no sight of the airship 
-PRON- reckon -PRON- speed at twothird of -PRON- own so that if -PRON- be in -PRON- course -PRON- should have sight -PRON- in about two hour fly 
two hour pass and -PRON- seem that -PRON- have escape -PRON- 
-PRON- keep head in the same direction for about another halfhour then -PRON- consult what to do 
-PRON- be decide that -PRON- cast a wide circle to the north keep high so i swing the merlin in a wide loop up into what must have be the southern border of venezuela 
i reckon to describe a circle five hundred kilometre in circumference which at the height -PRON- be fly would give -PRON- a vast area for scrutiny 
-PRON- be now over the upper reach of the northern confluent of the amazon and beneath -PRON- roll endless mile of dark greengrey foliage 
-PRON- see here and there the silver gleam of water wide river that thin be lose in the foliage and appear again 
but everywhere the dominant note be that hardly break hue of dark greygreen 
if the airship have be anywhere below -PRON- -PRON- would have be distinct against that sombre background 
but time and again the distant gleam of water would deceive -PRON- would send -PRON- chase at full speed and -PRON- circle grow very ragged of outline 
the strain of fly at that height and speed be begin to tell on -PRON- and -PRON- constant watch have weary -PRON- eye in spite of that uncanny alertness of perception which quick flight induce so at halfpast ten when -PRON- have cast two wide circle -PRON- vote a spell of rest and i search about for big enough water in which to come down 
-PRON- seem to have miss -PRON- quarry entirely 
then in the midst of that drab green monotony below -PRON- with -PRON- endless hummock of undulate tree top there come a break 
from what appear to be an area of marshland for -PRON- be speckle with water there rise a short incline of bush this be succeed by a spear of plateau rise on tawny bluff of rock 
mighty interesting -PRON- find this plateau for from a point north of -PRON- centre line in a widen scar there stretch to one side of -PRON- a sudden patch of blood red 
by chance i have hit on the right word to explain this red streak 
-PRON- be more like a raw scar on the face of the world than anything else 
from -PRON- starting point -PRON- widen as -PRON- run transversely over the green tableland then begin to narrow as -PRON- drop over the bluff on the south side until -PRON- be lose in the green of the low level 
seem to be some curious outcrop say dan -PRON- look sinister and cruel somehow hit -PRON- danny i agree just what -PRON- do look 
near this red streak but separate from -PRON- by a thickening band of green the plateau take another sudden rise in bushhung rocky bluff and on this second step as -PRON- be there lie a wide expanse of water under the spur of what from the map i judge be the foothill of the parima mountain land on the lake there say danny and maybe -PRON- can get down to look at that outcrop like to see that 
the water seem fair for landing and what be more important for take off again so i let the merlin hover down gently to the face of the lake 
i taxi a little on touch then switch off and let the way on the plane carry -PRON- until -PRON- be nose into the tree and bush that fringe the still water 
the plateau of the red scar here be something uncanny about that lake though -PRON- be wonderfully beautiful 
the tree round -PRON- be not extremely tall but -PRON- be straight and smooth of trunk fheir branch begin to shoot out only at a good height 
these lock with the branch of the other around until the foliage above be a thick canopy unpierced by the ray of the sun 
the undergrowth be thick and luxuriant but not nearly so high as i have think -PRON- would be 
the prevail color be a dusty green unbroken unrelieved except for the browner grey of the treetrunk or when some big butterfly gaudily paint and amazingly wide of wingspread would flutter swiftly by 
now and then there would come the shriek of a bird shatter the stillness and intensify -PRON- 
i have say stillness but -PRON- be not so much that 
a weird hush murmur clung to the place the hum of insect the sound of a myriad life and under -PRON- all a mysterious deep chatter and whisper whisper and chatter so dead in tone as to be almost undefinable as sound 
the place grip 
-PRON- almost sicken one with -PRON- intensity 
and one could not tell what -PRON- be that grip what bring the sicken intensity 
here man be terribly puny in the face of immutable nature and -PRON- lovely merlin in -PRON- modernity be an offence 
i think -PRON- companion feel much as i do but -PRON- wasnot a thing to talk about 
-PRON- look at each other with a sickly kind of gaiety like a lot of boy steal into a cathedral in prohibit hour 
milliken the practical make the first attempt to break the spell 
-PRON- light the stove and bring out the fryingpan 
-PRON- have a sort of second breakfast ard then dan and i clamber ashore leave milliken who would not be persuade to leave the merlin to keep watch and ward 
for -PRON- adventure danny and i take with -PRON- an automatic apiece and a pocket compass 
both of -PRON- have flyingboot on so -PRON- feel safe enough about snake which be all -PRON- think -PRON- have to dread 
-PRON- seem impossible that there could be any human being in that wilderness 
-PRON- push -PRON- way westward through the undergrowth make for the bluff that overhung the plateau of the red scar and although the going be heavy -PRON- be not superlatively difficult 
with half an hour of scramble -PRON- be on the bluff and the oppression of the dark forest leave -PRON- as -PRON- breathe the sweet air of -PRON- edge 
down below -PRON- lie the tableland perhaps forty metre beneath and -PRON- could see the red outcrop plainly 
water lie on either side of the plateau to the south a winding river with a creek run up to the cliff of the highland and to the north a small lake -PRON- have barely notice in -PRON- approach by the air from the south 
this lake be drain -PRON- seem by another winding river that run through a little gorge into the marshland surround the toe of the plateau 
-PRON- find a place where the limestone be not so sheer and a way down that promise a fairly easy return 
tree hug the base of the bluff but -PRON- soon be quit of -PRON- as -PRON- work towards the red scar for -PRON- thin out until -PRON- be among bush of the nature of myrtle 
as -PRON- get near the outcrop even these myrtle thin until -PRON- be far apart and strangely stunt in growth 
then -PRON- foot crunch on the red earth 
to -PRON- that earth seem to be live 
i feel the hair prickle on -PRON- scalp and i have a foolish impulse to jump back to the blacker and somehow clean soil 
nothing grow on this red stuff whisper dan 
see jimmy there s not a plant or a blade of grass on -PRON- and look how these myrtle be thin and stunt until -PRON- be away back from -PRON- get off -PRON- danny i say donot like -PRON- 
-PRON- feel that too -PRON- mutter suppose -PRON- the desolation of -PRON- but i have just the same feeling work round -PRON- then i say 
danny do not seem to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- be frown at the earth and scrabble amongst -PRON- speculatively with the toe of -PRON- boot 
-PRON- turn over a piece of rock and stoop to pick -PRON- up 
when -PRON- straighten -PRON- -PRON- face be red but the color come from some suppress excitement 
look at this jimmy -PRON- say hold out the rock 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- be 
-PRON- be a cindery kind of rock blueblack in color with facet that shine faintly and a dusty layer saffron to deep rise in tint clung to a side of -PRON- 
i have never see rock like -PRON- before 
no i say eat -PRON- hat if this the red stuff isnot rhodolite say dan -PRON- eye dance 
well i say pettishly for i want to be off that red muck 
rhodolite jimmy dan say solemnly and there wasnot so much of the boy about -PRON- now 
rhodolite be one of the most highly radioactive ore that have be discover 
small quantity of -PRON- have be find in africa and i believe in peru 
i have have piece of -PRON- in -PRON- lab 
but nothing nearly so good as this -PRON- crouch down now let the red stuff dribble through -PRON- finger have a hunch -PRON- say that all this scar be highly radioactive 
that explain why nothing grow on -PRON- 
see how the tree avoid -PRON- how the bush close to -PRON- be poor and almost wither 
yes get off -PRON- jimmy 
the thing alive 
-PRON- meet again make -PRON- way back to the decent earth and work northward round the end of the red scar 
-PRON- be a strangely silent couple then 
dan have lose -PRON- boyishness and -PRON- face have a queer expression of power 
i be get a flash of the daniel lamont who could add so many letter to -PRON- name the daniel lamont whose word go with the lead scientist of the day 
-PRON- trudge through the undergrowth in a norwesterly direction make for the edge of the plateau that overhung the little lake -PRON- have see from the bluff above 
with -PRON- heavy bulk i break the trail -PRON- friend come after -PRON- 
i donot suppose -PRON- have be labor twenty minute before -PRON- be on the edge of the plateau 
below -PRON- lie the little basin from which run the winding stream but because of the configuration of the cliff and -PRON- overhang -PRON- view be not very good 
half the basin be cut off from sight by a ridge that run out from the side of the plateau a mighty funny air about that place down there danny whisper when -PRON- have look in silence for a minute or two 
what be -PRON- jimmy donot know dan unless -PRON- be that -PRON- a little too trim for -PRON- surrounding think -PRON- have say -PRON- jimmy -PRON- say that the neck of the basin have be widen 
or else why be the river bank there so sheer when at other place -PRON- be undercut or fall in 
spade 
i whisper say so 
nigger 
not the kind of thing nigger would do 
-PRON- discover a grow suspicion in each other eye 
what do -PRON- say to cross the plateau to the other side i ask softly and see what s there 
do -PRON- strike -PRON- danny that the little lake below must be fill from somewhere or else how do -PRON- explain the steady current into the river 
that strip -PRON- take to be a creek on the other side maybe -PRON- flow under the plateau say danny investigate anyhow 
-PRON- turn south and begin to work down the west side of the scar 
for a space the going be heavy but after a little the undergrowth begin to thin out 
the plateau seem to be atout a kilometre wide perhaps more so with the heavy go at the start of -PRON- cross the journey look like take -PRON- about half an hour 
i want to clear the thing up get back to the merlin and be in maracaybo by nightfall 
-PRON- be now long past noon somewhere about halfpast one and the heat be oppressive 
-PRON- have to make -PRON- way back over the red outcrop climb the bluff and find -PRON- trail through the forest to the lake above and the erlin 
-PRON- suspicion have die down 
the whole place be so desolate and lonely so silent that to think -PRON- be somewhere in the neighborhood of the raider lair seem too farfetched 
i be anxious to be on the chase again 
danny however have some idea in -PRON- head 
-PRON- be plug along by -PRON- side with an alertness and keenness that i be at a loss to account for so after a long spell of silence -PRON- curiosity get the well of -PRON- 
i turn to -PRON- friend and stop -PRON- 
come old man i say 
out with -PRON- in -PRON- mind 
honest jimmy -PRON- say donot know just a lump of suspicion that rhodolite -PRON- see get -PRON- sort of mix up with radium -PRON- mean yes 
confound -PRON- jimmy get to account for all that radium somehow i gaze at -PRON- for a second or two 
all right dan i say go on but if there s anything in -PRON- be too far away from the merlin to be comfortable 
-PRON- go on 
i now catch more than a touch of excitement and alertness 
-PRON- be press south a little westward when suddenly -PRON- catch a gleam of something high and white among the greygreen of the foliage and towards this gleam -PRON- cautiously thread -PRON- way 
presently -PRON- be near enough to see that the whitish gleam come from a number of conical stone spike stand high among the bush 
sinter cone whisper dan like those of hammam meskoutine in tunis hot spring yes 
a gradual crystalline precipitation building up into a hollow cone 
mighty queer plateau dan -PRON- be a mighty queer plateau jimmy -PRON- interrupt 
just take a look at the peak of that middle cone 
what would -PRON- say that shimmering haze be heat by hookey a kind of chimney 
gimme a leg up jimmy whisper dan 
and let see what kind of heat -PRON- trample through the undergrowth to the side of the middle cone and then i help dan to climb up to the top 
-PRON- put -PRON- head close to the mouth and sniff cautiously 
then -PRON- turn round and down to -PRON- with a face livid with excitement 
jimmy i let -PRON- slide to the ground -PRON- see what -PRON- mean jimmy -PRON- cry something do underground the smell of petroleum by christopher jimmy i believe -PRON- have track -PRON- exactly say a familiar voice behind -PRON- 
put up -PRON- hand messrs 
jame boon and company 
-PRON- rather expect -PRON- would be drop in one day 
-PRON- turn in a hurry to find -PRON- look down the muzzle of three rifle project from the bush 
then behind a pistol in front of -PRON- the bush part 
a big man rise up to -PRON- full height still cover -PRON- 
-PRON- be commander seton 
book two the personal narrative of sholto seton etc commander i the litter in the clearing i patience and determination have bring reader thus far in a particularly haphazard and illknit story apology from -PRON- for take -PRON- back three year will be superfluous 
pertinacity so singular though -PRON- be grow but from an irritated desire to finish a penance will find nothing daunt in even so drastic a backward leap 
yet by way of apology for the retracing i be fain to say this much 
if i be to achieve reasonable accuracy in -PRON- share of the history and if i be to make -PRON- properly understand by the patient reader i can do no other 
in the matter of introduce -PRON- the flattering analysis of -PRON- character and the slight sketch of -PRON- history give by major boon in -PRON- narrative like the wound of klercutio though -PRON- be neither as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door -PRON- will serve 
indeed -PRON- must serve faute de mieux since i have waste much breath and time in urge boon to alter -PRON- or delete -PRON- altogether and i can not begin to give -PRON- own version 
in justice to -PRON- and -PRON- i be compel to say further that the pen be a most unfamiliar implement to -PRON- -PRON- wildest hope be that i may spin a plain yam 
true i have gain a measure of courage for -PRON- task through watch the airy insouciance with which boon have be pound out chapter on -PRON- typewrite machine and i tell -PRON- that if -PRON- can be without bowel of compassion for -PRON- reader so surely can as i go along i shall try to vamp something of a technique from -PRON- and from other great writer and so win through with what credit i may three year then before that morning in march when the ark of the covenant drop silently from the sky upon the financial center of new york i be with two expetty officer of -PRON- royal navy and a handful of indian bearer among the upper reach of the rio negro that northern tributary of the amazon 
of the reason and the urge which take -PRON- into such an isolated and labyrinthine tract of wilderness i shall say little 
-PRON- be personal and may easily be tedious 
i be seek what i may find in unexplored country 
higgin grumstock and -PRON- come upon many thing of a strange nature in that wilderness but by far the strange thing that happen to -PRON- be the finding of -PRON- whom -PRON- afterwards be to know as the master 
-PRON- be towards nightfall of a teeminghot day 
-PRON- be about to make camp by the side of an unnamed river tributary to the negro and be look for some place suitable when suddenly -PRON- break into a small clearing in which be the remain of a recent camp 
so recent indeed be these remain that there where a night growth will obliterate anything but the deep of man handprint the undergrowth be still trampled and awry 
about the clearing empty box with smash lid be scatter and these bring to the scene such evidence of haste and confusion that interest be at once deeply stir 
i know of no party ahead of -PRON- own nor be there wind of any come down from the border of venezuela or colombia 
-PRON- be unlikely in the latter case that the explorer have pass -PRON- since -PRON- be impossible that -PRON- have cross unnecessarily to the other side of the river or have stray far from -PRON- bank 
from the indication around -PRON- be force to the sinister conclusion that the former occupant of the clearing have be attack by indian 
no sane explorer would have indulge in the frenzy of breakage or the partition of store which be show 
i resolve therefore with the help of -PRON- two man to arrive at what solution i could of the mystery 
as a preliminary to the search -PRON- make camp then and there 
the bearer be order to unload and pile store 
higgin and grumstock avid for anything which promise a break in the monotony of week of toilsome journeying quickly have the tent erect and with that unfailing lingua franca by which the british seaman make -PRON- everywhere understand badger and cajole the indian into unheardof activity 
-PRON- search be not of long duration 
a sudden shout take -PRON- hurry back from the side on which i have start investigation to the other and here a little way deep in the forest i find -PRON- two man in awed contemplation of a roughlymade litter which be sling at a fair height between two tree 
in this litter a white man lie to all appearance dead 
-PRON- be a small man and -PRON- two helper have no difficulty in unhitch the litter from the tree or in convey -PRON- to the near tent -PRON- own as -PRON- happen 
under the powerful light of a petrol lamp i make examination of the stranger and i find -PRON- heart though scarcely discernible be still beat 
even with that medical knowledge which i have -PRON- be plainly manifest to -PRON- that collapse have follow fever and partial starvation and i begin to administer gentle stimulant and easy nutritive 
-PRON- labor be reward by a slight strengthening of the heartbeat but there be no sign of return consciousness 
i strip the man to put -PRON- into clean linen and i be horrify to find that -PRON- body be terribly burn 
a great patch on the left side be deeply raw and inflame and most nauseating feature of all the left hand seem to have be burn off from above the wrist 
-PRON- be a marvel that the man remain alive 
these be injury which i despair of treat adequately from -PRON- little medicine chest and i should have be completely at a loss what to do have the stranger not have the mean of treatment with -PRON- 
in the litter whereon -PRON- have be lie -PRON- find beside a washleath bag apparently contain geological specimen a large pot of reddish ointment clean and fresh 
i could find faint trace of this ointment on the fair skin round the burn and i think the wise thing in the circumstance be to continue the use of -PRON- 
i take clean strip of medicate linen and with loose bandage of these i apply the ointment to the dreadful wound 
-PRON- be two day before the man open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- have not attempt to break camp and -PRON- stay in the clearing have be without event 
the return to consciousness be abrupt 
i go into the tent to see how the patient be progress and find -PRON- gaze into the mild pair of blue eye i have ever see 
mild though -PRON- be yet something lie in -PRON- depth that one meet with a shock almost physical 
what be -PRON- name the stranger ask levelly 
sholto seton i reply 
an explorer 
in an amateur way yes 
how long ago be -PRON- since -PRON- find -PRON- -PRON- demand 
-PRON- will be fortyeight hour ago at seven this evening 
-PRON- be in a litter slung between two tree 
yes 
i make -PRON- bearer put -PRON- there 
what day of the week be that monday 
monday i say 
yes 
this be the third day of the sun since i become unconscious 
-PRON- be on monday that -PRON- bearer desert -PRON- 
-PRON- be in the nick of time mr seton be i right in the form of address 
-PRON- have the look of authority that come from command be by courtesy commander seton lately of the british navy i reply 
but do -PRON- think -PRON- should talk sir shall finish in a moment say this strangely selfcontaine patient 
with what have -PRON- be treat -PRON- i explain what i have do 
excellent 
now commander seton i be afraid i must draw on -PRON- patience and good nature to the extent of relapse into unconsciousness for another day 
continue the treatment especially the ointment which -PRON- must not attempt to vary in any way 
-PRON- be adequate in -PRON- 
thank -PRON- 
and until this time tomorrow when i shall waken in complete command of -PRON- goodday 
-PRON- close those remarkable eye of -PRON- and be asleep 
i be leave with the impression despite -PRON- utmost frailty of physique of a personality nigh ruthless in dominate willpower a personality which grip with hoop of steel and of a courage in the face of what must have be agonize pain which nearly appal 
for the space of ten minute i think i stand where i be 
then i tiptoe over to look down at -PRON- 
-PRON- have not fall asleep 
-PRON- have relapse back into a state of deep unconsciousness 
i mark the broad brow and deep head of the thinker the exquisite placing of shapely ear the fine setting of the eye the clean chiselling of the nose 
through a thin brown beard and moustache could be see a mouth in shape at once firm and mobile 
-PRON- be a head in a million satisfying one sense with both beauty and power 
in spite of the luxuriance of -PRON- fine brown hair i judge -PRON- to be from fifty to sixty year of age 
i steal from the tent 
seton enlist recover as i have see a boxer recover between round deliberately 
-PRON- rest deliberately relax until -PRON- be ready to stir and -PRON- be a fortnight before -PRON- move from the tent 
i have not ask -PRON- name nor do i ever ask -PRON- name 
from the first i call -PRON- sir until -PRON- come to the time when i openly call -PRON- master 
strange though -PRON- may seem from the first i know that -PRON- have but to lift a finger and i would obey -PRON- behest 
nor do i think i ever depart from -PRON- manhood right in give -PRON- such service 
-PRON- be a fortnight before -PRON- begin to speak at any length and in this silence -PRON- seem that -PRON- rest -PRON- brain as deliberately as -PRON- do -PRON- tortured body 
-PRON- two seamen higgin and grumstock accept -PRON- as i do and -PRON- almost fall over each other or even out with each other in -PRON- desire to do -PRON- service 
i shall not readily forget -PRON- first long talk deep in the heart of the murmuring forest 
-PRON- be night and -PRON- be in the tent together for -PRON- share -PRON- now -PRON- be fit to walk abroad 
i be put some note together of -PRON- observation in explore when suddenly -PRON- speak 
seton -PRON- say be ready to talk if -PRON- be 
yes sir i say as readily as though a talk have be prearrange be ready 
-PRON- be a matter of turn -PRON- campchair to face -PRON- and then -PRON- bid -PRON- tell -PRON- of -PRON- experience in the war of i have none of the hesitation i should normally have feel at obey such a request 
i tell -PRON- all i have do from start to finish 
would -PRON- have -PRON- happen again -PRON- ask when i have finish 
noy sir i say truthfully hope -PRON- have see the last of war forever vain hope -PRON- good seton -PRON- say quietly 
the nation of the earth have forget 
-PRON- have forget the bloodshed and ruin of those terrible year the martyrdom of woman the sacrifice of man 
too quickly have -PRON- forget 
lust and anger sway -PRON- and the greed of gain jealousy of -PRON- neighbor 
in -PRON- blindness -PRON- would repeat those awful year know i say 
-PRON- be fool 
i give -PRON- another three year and some of -PRON- will be at -PRON- again 
-PRON- will be big than ever 
i know -PRON- hope be vain when i express -PRON- sir 
three year -PRON- say half to -PRON- 
-PRON- could be accomplish in three year 
then aloud be -PRON- a rich man seton have rather more than half a million english pound 
how much of that fortune would -PRON- give -PRON- ask if -PRON- be guarantee to -PRON- beyond any possible doubt that war could be stop forever on this earth every penny of -PRON- sir i say 
and if seton if i offer -PRON- that guarantee 
why sir listen to -PRON- help -PRON- look at -PRON- in silence for a minute 
from far away in the forest around -PRON- there come a deep boom as of a great bell suddenly smitten 
what -PRON- be i can not pretend to say but the forest be like that 
a great noise quite inexplicable then the silence once more save for the neverceasing whisper that hardly break the uncanny stillness 
seton say the man earnestly want -PRON- word that if -PRON- can not believe what i shall tell -PRON- if -PRON- can not see -PRON- way clear to stand by -PRON- side i want -PRON- word that -PRON- will never repeat a syllable of -PRON- to ear other than mine that -PRON- will lock -PRON- up in -PRON- heart forever give -PRON- -PRON- word sir 
then the master lay bare -PRON- plan to stop war 
even now with the year behind -PRON- when i work by -PRON- side -PRON- brain reel as i remember that night 
far into the night the master talk patiently explain to -PRON- lay understanding secret that have revolutionize science 
-PRON- tell of the mighty power which have come into -PRON- hand after year of endless labor of pick up discard thread at first think useless of follow up path of promise which end in disappointment and in the end of the discovery of a further path which even -PRON- with all -PRON- magnificent intellect dare not pursue to -PRON- end 
-PRON- be unbelievable yet i believe 
in the hollow of that frail hand -PRON- fellow lose in indescribable suffering and torture in the search for that terrible secret there lie the power to free mankind or to destroy to lay waste the whole earth aye and world beyond 
i believe but belief be agony 
hour after hour -PRON- talk in that tireless untiresome level voice of -PRON- 
a litte man frail suffer the torture of the damn from great crack sore yet placid mild gentle with never a wince never a smile even to mock -PRON- anguish 
year of calvary lie behind -PRON- and a quarter of a century of ceaseless toil 
i say no live man could endure as the master endure 
as -PRON- speak to -PRON- in the forest that night i begin to think that everything but the will be go body soul everything which go to make up the move whimper purposeless thing -PRON- call man everything but the will 
the will and the vision 
yet as i look back on the year that begin that night remember the love i bear -PRON- and the tender win ungrudge patient something that emanate from -PRON- to wrap -PRON- to -PRON- i hope and pray that more than the will be leave 
and so -PRON- finish and so -PRON- dear seton that afternoon when i open -PRON- eye and see -PRON- i believe that at last i have find -PRON- lieutenant 
i believe that at last the path towards realize -PRON- dream be open for -PRON- 
be -PRON- the man sholto seton 
think well for here be the least i will take from -PRON- the most i will offer -PRON- 
three year of belief of unswerving devotion to -PRON- cause 
three year of unremitting toil without reward except that which will come from the cause -PRON- 
i offer -PRON- no more 
i will take no less 
as i rise from -PRON- chair -PRON- whole body be quiver and i be soak in perspiration 
i could not answer -PRON- 
i reel to the tent door and out into the open then stumble across the clearing to the riverside 
i put -PRON- head on two hand cross against a big tree and do what i may i could not hold -PRON- from a terrible dry sobbing 
when i lift -PRON- head a faint light be begin to steal through the leave overhead and bird be begin to chatter 
i walk back to the tent 
-PRON- be still in -PRON- chair as though -PRON- have not move 
well seton 
yes sir i say if -PRON- will have -PRON- 
that be well -PRON- say 
and now -PRON- dear fellow find what remnant of sleep -PRON- can 
-PRON- must begin at once and i have much to tell -PRON- yet 
off to the plateau i the cool of the following morning -PRON- break camp and set off on the long trek back to manaos 
of the journey there be little of moment to tell 
i have make -PRON- own arrangement for retire from the wilderness and -PRON- be fresher for be use a little earlier than i have anticipate 
i have a bungalow outside the town of manaos and there i take the master and -PRON- two man 
i have pay off the bearer a good deal higher up the river and -PRON- finish -PRON- journey on a powerboat of mine 
the washleath bag which i have think contain geological specimen prove to have in -PRON- a collection of the fine rough brazilian diamond -PRON- have ever be -PRON- fortune to see 
the master in the characteristically sparing way -PRON- have simply state that -PRON- have discover a pipe of -PRON- in the high reach of the negro and -PRON- idea be that fund for begin -PRON- work should come from the sale of these uncut gem 
i have to go to amsterdam to dispose of -PRON- and -PRON- be also agree that i should begin to liquidate -PRON- property by degree so that no suspicion would be arouse 
i leave grumstock with the master at manaos and take higgin with -PRON- to europe where from a list provide -PRON- i begin to buy chemical and physical plant for the work the master have to do 
i have in fact to bring together all the instrument necessary for a small laboratory 
-PRON- be ten week before the liner drop -PRON- and -PRON- store at manaos 
i find the master greatly recover and grumstock very much instal as -PRON- bodyservant cook and housekeeper 
grumstock inform -PRON- quite gratuitously that -PRON- be ready to follow the owner as -PRON- call -PRON- leader anywhere 
on this hint i find -PRON- expedient to outline the plan to -PRON- two old petty officer and i be gratify to find -PRON- willing and eager to come into the scheme 
thus -PRON- have two good man try man honest and handy as a nucleus for -PRON- crew 
a few day after -PRON- reburn to manaos -PRON- begin -PRON- voyage up the river 
at a former base where i be friendly with a local headman i be fortunate enough to secure a fine lot of bearer 
among the store -PRON- carry be the section of a goodsized canoe 
grumstock be an efficient carpenter and the plan be to finish -PRON- journey by water after -PRON- have put -PRON- little craft together 
this plan the master assure -PRON- be possible 
-PRON- be perhaps as well that the plan include the i take this report to -PRON- leader 
yes yes seton -PRON- reply 
-PRON- be a point in -PRON- favor 
the scar be there on the plateau a red outcrop of radioactive mineral which i hope to be able to use to some purpose 
nothing will grow on the outcrop and at certain time of the year water or wind through some underground passage of the plateau give out a terrible howling 
hence the fear of the native 
but as i say a point in -PRON- favor since -PRON- may work unmolested 
when -PRON- reach the water the relief of the bearer at be dismiss be evident 
-PRON- have no sooner free -PRON- than -PRON- troop off back the way -PRON- have come and -PRON- be i think not a little scared for -PRON- 
the work of put together -PRON- canoe occupy the oifthc hsin of the stein dismissal of -PRON- bearer when -PRON- take to the water for as -PRON- approach the end of -PRON- portage -PRON- become manifest that the indian be grow restless and uneasy 
i be afraid that -PRON- be about to desert -PRON- and i search for the reason of -PRON- unrest but find the more intelligent of the bearer unwilling to talk 
-PRON- be higgin who bring -PRON- the clue 
as far as i can make out sir -PRON- explain headin due and proper for a place -PRON- call the hill of spook 
another name -PRON- give -PRON- be the wound in the world 
accordin to -PRON- nigger there s a great big bloody scar in the body of the earth somewhere near ere and every now and then -PRON- can hear the earth howlin and groanin wi the pain from -PRON- 
-PRON- be old that tell -PRON- about -PRON- and a scared nigger -PRON- be too when -PRON- say -PRON- 
i get -PRON- from -PRON- by degree like 
grumstock and higgin and -PRON- less than a day and when -PRON- have -PRON- in the water -PRON- find -PRON- admirably suit for -PRON- purpose 
-PRON- hold -PRON- store easily and there be sufficient room leave to afford -PRON- leader -PRON- ease or as much ease as -PRON- poor body would allow -PRON- together with space for the adequate handling of -PRON- 
into the cavern i the early morning -PRON- set out for the mysterious plateau 
i shall say nothing of the journey except that -PRON- be arduous 
major boon have give a fairly accurate description of the lay of the land about the plateau 
-PRON- main axis run from east to west and the toe lie among marshy ground thickly grow with bladed plant and the myrtle and veronica type of shrub common in the district 
on the north a little basin lie under the plateau cliff and -PRON- approach be by a river which flow from this basin through a gorge quite navigable and bear in a westerly curve from a cup of land of which the plateau be the southern border 
on the south side of the plateau another river lie or rather a backwater of that river which i shall call the rio innominata 
-PRON- do not realize at -PRON- first approach of the plateau that -PRON- would have be possible to cut off several league of travel by make a portage to that backwater of which both entrance be cut off from the main stream by a mass of fall timber very much overgrown 
-PRON- take instead the long way 
out of the rio innominata at a good number of kilometre downstream from the backwater -PRON- turn into the basin river and describe a wide loop to the north of the plateau 
from the map -PRON- will be see that both the innominata and the stream from the basin in the northward cup flow west for the great part of -PRON- course and that the former turn south at last to curve into an easterlyrunne tributary of the negro in subsequent vo5rage the long route i have indicate be always follow and as a precaution against be detect -PRON- leave the overgrown entrance to the backwater undisturbed 
the basin to the north of the plateau be overhang by great limestone bluff which from the top must have hide half the basin area and this impend wall of rock be pierce by a great arch that lead to a cave under the plateau cave and basin be join by water 
-PRON- be with a sense of awe have light the acetylene searchlight in the bow that -PRON- begin to paddle into the cave 
the light but faintly illumine the vastness of the underground cathedral in which -PRON- now find -PRON- 
the ceiling be roughly arch and in -PRON- shadowed height one imagine that a fantastic pattern of vaulting could be trace 
here and there stalactitic pillar of great girth give color to the gothic effect 
-PRON- become conscious of the roar and plash of fall water then deep in the heart of the cavern -PRON- come on a waterfall in which from a height of about forty metre a swift stream tumble in great volume 
by jove sir i whisper to -PRON- leader what a chance there for power 
yes -PRON- reply 
but -PRON- will find the fall the least of the wonder i have to show -PRON- 
bear over to the right higgin please 
i now see that from the main cavern other cave run out on either side several of -PRON- with floor slope clear of the water line 
two of these in particular on the west with a common mouth to the main cavern be ideal for dock and build the airship which be part of -PRON- scheme 
with -PRON- leader i go ashore to examine these two cave and -PRON- lead the way into an inner cave rather small than the other pair 
here seton -PRON- say -PRON- be stand i be certain on the down slope of an anticlinal fold 
see how -PRON- run down under the basin of the main cavern 
at the toe of the plateau which i take to be the further slope of the saddle i find among the marsh certain indication of the presence of petroleum that greenish scum which i dare say -PRON- know i nod 
very well then 
if -PRON- can be avoid -PRON- do not wish to drill for -PRON- oil in the open but i think if -PRON- drill here -PRON- may do so with a reasonable hope of strike 
-PRON- pass round a wall of rock into another inner cave 
if -PRON- block up this cave have first make certain that there be no other outlet say the master -PRON- think -PRON- good seton -PRON- shall have an adequate reservoir for -PRON- crude oil why yes sir i reply in bewilderment at the completeness of the thing few bag of cement would put -PRON- right 
exactly 
now on the other side of the main cavern there be other cave i should like -PRON- to see 
i be inclined to think that -PRON- shall have -PRON- refinery and machine shop over there 
and i believe -PRON- shall find ample ventilation 
from the main mouth of the cave a ledge run on the east side to widen out into a spacious floor on the left of the big central cave 
this be so wide and deep that -PRON- be easy to picture an extensive machine shop there with plenty of room leave for the oil refinery 
-PRON- power be handy to -PRON- for the waterfall be only a few pace round the corner of rock 
-PRON- paddle deeper into the cavern and find that -PRON- extend the whole width of the plateau in a winding course of waterway 
at the other side the south egress be give by an opening with little headroom to a small creek join the backwater of the rio innominata 
there be some flow of water from the fall to this outlet but the main run be to the northern opening 
the land about the plateau be very flat 
-PRON- return and -PRON- leader show the way into a cave near the main entrance on the west side 
-PRON- have to climb into this cave which be so close to the plateau side that light percolate through from the open by several crack 
the cave be one of a series on the same level high and dry and apparently well ventilate 
these -PRON- be easy to decide would be the live quarter of the crew when -PRON- be form 
while higgin and grumstock bring out store into the live cave by mean of a hastily rig block and tackle i find a pickaxe and begin to widen one of the crevice to the open air 
-PRON- be easy labor for the rock here be pliable and i soon have hew a biggish window permit a view of the cuplike hollow to the north of the plateau 
the store be bring up 
grumstock and higgin fall to set out shipshape sleep quarter and presently to cook a meal 
-PRON- pass the night in well condition than either the master or -PRON- have ever experience among the upper water of the amazon 
-PRON- be thousand of mile from the near civilization right in the heart of virgin forest and as cut off from the knowledge of man as if -PRON- have be in another world 
the gas find i the morning after an invigorating plunge and swim in the clear cool water of the cave -PRON- set about form a laboratory for -PRON- chief 
-PRON- have no wood with which to set up bench so -PRON- cut a deep ledge into one of the wall of the cave and shovel the debris out of the window opening 
when -PRON- have make a good enough ledge to set out all the instrument and the plant -PRON- leader require and have undercut -PRON- so that -PRON- could have comfort in stand close -PRON- level the floor 
meantime the chief have be explore alone 
grumstock with -PRON- ready wit have fix thole pin in the after part of the canoe thwart and have provide a long paddleoar so that the master could maneuver the little craft with -PRON- single hand 
-PRON- have be away several hour and i be begin to think -PRON- time i go in search of -PRON- when -PRON- return 
could -PRON- spare half an hour from -PRON- labor seton to come with -PRON- -PRON- ask 
certainly sir shall require a widenecke bottle 
could -PRON- find -PRON- such a thing grumstock dunno about a bottle sir the seaman say doubtfully 
what about a picklejar sir 
excellent if -PRON- have a stopper 
stopper sir yes sir get one of -PRON- that work with a lever expand thing sir say grumstock with an air of be meticulously accurate to the man of science 
the seaman wash the jar carefully and with this and a bundle of candle -PRON- set out have find a light gas seton the master explain in one of the high cave beyond the fall 
i be climb up into -PRON- with the naked light of a candle when suddenly i find difficulty in breathing and the candle go out 
i quickly retreat and now -PRON- be about to take a sample 
i need -PRON- two hand and strong lung 
-PRON- be paddle across the main cavern and -PRON- stoop over the side to the water and fill the jar which -PRON- carefully stopper 
-PRON- land on the eastern side and begin to climb into a sort of tunnel -PRON- lead 
-PRON- have mount some distance when suddenly -PRON- candle go out and -PRON- come back hurriedly 
-PRON- now be outside a smallish cave above the level so i imagine of the main cavern roof 
now seton the chief say this be what i want -PRON- to do 
take the picklejar 
how long could -PRON- hold -PRON- breath 
about half a minute probably more 
that will do 
i want -PRON- to run up into the gas hold -PRON- breath 
raise the jar above -PRON- head and let the water pour out 
keep the jar mouth down and as soon as -PRON- be empty of water stopper -PRON- 
then come back as quickly as possible understand sir 
the idea be to get as far into the gas as be safe 
two step high when -PRON- candle go out will do 
just see how long -PRON- can do without a breath 
i test -PRON- with the stophand of -PRON- watch and find i could do fortyfive second easily 
excellent 
now donot run any risk not powerful enough to drag -PRON- out -PRON- understand 
right sir take care 
i take the candle and the jar and begin to climb hold the light over -PRON- head 
as soon as the light go out i drop the candle and take a breath easily then run up about four pace 
i let the water out of the jar as i hold -PRON- up and quickly replace the stopper 
i retreat with some wind to spare 
well do seton cry the master 
and now to see the nature of the gas 
-PRON- be light and i should say inert 
-PRON- return to the cave in the cliff and spend the rest of the day in arrange the scientific instrument help -PRON- chief to prepare for -PRON- first test of the gas 
-PRON- explain that -PRON- could not be a thorough test but that -PRON- may be able to determine the nature of the stuff 
that night i retire to the cavern where the two seaman sleep and turn in alongside -PRON- leave -PRON- leader work by lamplight 
in the early morning i waken to find -PRON- stand by -PRON- bedside 
seton -PRON- say believe -PRON- have discover a new light uninflammable gas and i think -PRON- may have enough to lift -PRON- airship 
-PRON- have save month of labor by the find 
-PRON- must set out for europe again as soon as possible 
form a crew iggin come with -PRON- in the canoe for the first stage of -PRON- journey to europe and when -PRON- have put -PRON- on land for -PRON- solitary trek down the negro -PRON- leave -PRON- to return to the plateau 
i have little difficulty if -PRON- take -PRON- some time in reach manaos where i find a passage to new orlean 
-PRON- purpose in make for this american port be simple for there i have a friend on whose discretion and help i could implicitly rely 
this be a southerner an american gentleman of the fine type and one of those who in the early part of the european war have find a way into the british fly service 
-PRON- have work together in the service and i know -PRON- man for a closemouthe shrewd and capable fellow who none the less permit deep languor and slow drawling speech to belie a mind well above the average for alertness and keen business instinct 
lippencott for that be -PRON- name be a trader in new orlean and i have decide on -PRON- subject to -PRON- consent as the most important link -PRON- should have with the outside world 
i go straight to -PRON- and explain the scheme without reserve 
-PRON- agree to help 
i place a large sum of money to -PRON- credit and give -PRON- list of the plant and store -PRON- be to purchase for -PRON- list which the chief and -PRON- have go over thoroughly until -PRON- know -PRON- have miss nothing 
lippencott anticipate no difficulty in meet -PRON- requirement and agree to scatter the order so that any trace would be difficult to find in the future 
at the plateau -PRON- have for example to drill for oil which entail the purchase of drill and case with the necessary power and a small refining plant 
then -PRON- have the gas to tap the chief have become certain that a seal reservoir lie behind the wall of the cave in which -PRON- have take the sample and this mean the buying of rock drill and pipe 
for utilize the water of the fall -PRON- need hydraulic main turbine and dynamo 
plant for the machineshop be the next consideration with small motor for the lathe and so forth 
-PRON- have to have cement for bedding down the engine 
and finally -PRON- need agricultural implement seed potato so that -PRON- could cultivate enough land to supply vegetable for the crew of the airship when -PRON- should arrive at the plateau 
to the task of collect all this mass of material lippencott apply -PRON- with a devotion and energy which even -PRON- lackadaisical demeanor could not disguise and -PRON- be the mean of put two of -PRON- good officer in -PRON- way 
setori -PRON- drawl at -PRON- have a young brother who could do with have the edge of a pretty large deviltry rub off 
could -PRON- find a place for -PRON- in -PRON- crew let -PRON- have a look at -PRON- lippencott i reply 
-PRON- can understand that i must make no mistake in -PRON- man 
sure say lippencott and stretch a lazy hand for the telephone 
dave -PRON- say when -PRON- have the connection just look in here for a moment 
i want -PRON- to meet commander seton 
contrive not to be arrest for speed on -PRON- way here 
speed fiend be -PRON- 
and then some say lippencott 
but no hog a wizard at the wheel and so far hasnot kill even a chicken 
drive a french ambulance because -PRON- be too young for the army 
david lippencott be a slim dark young fellow with deepset eye perhaps a little too close together for frankness but -PRON- mouth be large and goodnatured 
-PRON- have the same appearance of languor as -PRON- brother but a glance be sufficient to show that -PRON- quality of muscle be of the stringy untiring kind 
i like -PRON- at first sight 
yes commander seton -PRON- say when after an hour or two of -PRON- company i put the thing to -PRON- like to join -PRON- 
but like -PRON- to give a friend of mine steve curtis a chance of join too 
good man be -PRON- 
-PRON- bet and can keep -PRON- mouth shut too like steve -PRON- brother affirm 
thus before i have be in new orlean two day i have enlist the service of three good man include traver lippencott -PRON- master of supply 
steven curtis be a fairhaire sturdy young american short and wide shoulder with a voice i discover that may have charm the heart out of a brass buddha 
-PRON- write -PRON- own verse and compose -PRON- own tune and sing -PRON- to an accompaniment on the guitar 
-PRON- also could whistle as i have never hear man whistle in -PRON- life 
these gift -PRON- will be understand be valuable asset where -PRON- be contemplate to keep man away from civilization for some year 
in addition steve be like young lippencott give over heart and soul to internalcombustion engine 
-PRON- visit to new orlean save -PRON- much time for there through lippencott i hear of a small river vessel be offer for sale 
-PRON- be old but in good condition a motorship with twin engine of the diesel type 
-PRON- have start life as a steamer on the waterway on whose bank -PRON- be build the clyde and have afterwards be convert to internalcombustion engine 
under thirty metre in length not too broad of beam and draw slightly over two metre load -PRON- be just the kind of vessel that i have hope to purchase in britain and bring over the atlantic on a false bottom 
i buy -PRON- through -PRON- master of supply and give order to have -PRON- alter for carry cargo 
as lippencott and i turn ashore from -PRON- inspection of the little vessel and pause by the gangway in talk a strange figure seat on a bollard close by come gradually into -PRON- consciousness 
the figure be strange because -PRON- be foreign to the atmosphere of the place 
a very stout man -PRON- be who regardless of the heat of the day wear a thick blue pilot jacket 
-PRON- be smoke a rakish and slim clay pipe beautifully color and with a rugged thick hand on either knee -PRON- be gaze at the ship and -PRON- with an air of placid contentment 
now and again by a slow movement the pipe would be remove to permit of expectoration over the quayside the hand would return to the knee and the bovine gaze would come back to the little steamer and to -PRON- 
there be something so familiar about the placid stolidity of the mountainous figure and the contrast fragility of the slend clay pipe that for a moment i think i be dream 
i cross over to the bollard and stand in front of the man 
then with the same placidity the amazing unprehensile clump of finger of one hand be stretch out to com slowly to the peak of the cap and the huge figure slowly rise 
a deep husky voice rumble up from vast depth 
commander seton sir -PRON- roll ye a good day sir 
bless -PRON- heart and soul 
i exclaim 
smither aye aye sir i smither -PRON- be sir as wu with -PRON- sir on the cruiser dorset 
happy to see ye so earty sir pretty bobbish -PRON- i should think 
aye sir bobbish thankee kindly sir 
and what be -PRON- do in new orlean smither -PRON- hoist back -PRON- big shoulder and bring -PRON- oxlike eye into a fix stare at -PRON- 
like this sir -PRON- rumble be secondclass warrant shipwright on the orlean arter the waw 
i jine er sir arter -PRON- get to flyin like 
an wen -PRON- retire -PRON- as in the course o natur -PRON- be bounter do not avin any womenkind like an thinkin wi -PRON- weight as settlin down would make -PRON- eavi i make up -PRON- mind jest for something ter do like ter go round an visit all the place as the ship i be on wus name from 
-PRON- pause for a breath and to take another hitch as -PRON- be on -PRON- walleye gaze 
the george -PRON- explain wus easy a little pub down barkin way o the name 
i ad a bit o trouble ter find the minotaur but i come on another pub o that name outside davenport 
i find arethusa good ope the lion intrepid marlborough wi difficulty more or less but i find -PRON- pub mostly fact in natur sir as so many of be ship should be call artet pub ainot -PRON- sir 
extraordinary 
i agree for i want to hear the end of this peculiar odyssey 
dorset wus easy 
i just go down ter weymouth an as a quart at the anchor for the sake o old time so to speak 
the temeraire wus bothersome but i get down ter demerarar as bein as near as i could find 
orlean bring -PRON- ere though i do the french one too to make sure but -PRON- be a new ship an go ter do the amazon sir n then be finish 
and what then i ask 
then sir -PRON- say impressively then go ter find a quiet retired spot be i can just sit an think or mebbe not think at all if i like 
would -PRON- take a job that would give -PRON- a chance to sit and think from -PRON- 
ah take any job from yoii sir 
very pointedly 
right 
if -PRON- will look after this steamer for -PRON- until i get back from england take -PRON- to the amazon and find a quiet spot for -PRON- there 
so i secure sleepy sam smither a very important cog in the mechanism for a time as -PRON- shall learn and i picture with some amusement the delight of higgin and grumstock when -PRON- find -PRON- old shipmate join -PRON- 
i now leave the work in new orlean in the hand of lippencott with -PRON- brother steve curtis and smither to help -PRON- and set out for england where i hope to recruit another halfdozen man from among try comrade 
back to the plateau a lmost the first person of -PRON- acquaintance whom i encounter in england be the young marquis of devonridge 
-PRON- be come down the step of the wanderer club as i ascend -PRON- 
hello jumbo -PRON- exclaim use the nickname -PRON- bulk have give -PRON- 
get back from bugstalke in the wild and woolly have -PRON- 
get a good show of head 
fairish i say 
do anjdhe particular for the next three or four year pip suppose the next three or four year will find -PRON- dodge the taxgatherer as usual 
why 
think of take pity on a poor landowner have think of -PRON- pip 
but i understand that -PRON- have sell all the devonridge property 
-PRON- understand -PRON- dear jumbo -PRON- reply have lose nothing of -PRON- limpid clarity 
except for a cottage or two give over to old servant devonridge be a barren title these day 
if -PRON- be really game to take -PRON- out of this demagogueridden country -PRON- may enlist -PRON- service for the next four year at the remarkable stipend of say ten shilling a week 
that be to say to wit and videlicet for five florin per week -PRON- may acquire a cooksecretarychauffeurgunbearer warrant free from vice clean about the house faithful willing sober industrious surprisingly honest and guarantee to eat out of the hand 
do -PRON- go -PRON- jumbo go -PRON- pip 
come and have lunch 
very good sir 
and -PRON- lordship touch -PRON- hat obsequiously 
-PRON- have not much opportunity for talk during lunch 
the wanderer be usually crowd but after -PRON- have feed devonridge and i stroll down to -PRON- room at the foot of st street and there i outline the scheme to -PRON- 
-PRON- dear jumbo devonridge say when i have finish on 
qa va san dire as the french always say in novel writ at toot 
but i donot want -PRON- to take -PRON- on false pretence 
the idea of stop war convey absolutely nothing to -PRON- young mind except regret if the scheme win out that -PRON- shall put a lot of honest lad belong to -PRON- own class and a jew or so out of a job 
natheless do -PRON- mark the word jumbo natheless i be with -PRON- not out of any highfalutin notion but for the lark 
there wonot be much lark about -PRON- pip 
trust -PRON- to get some fun -PRON- smile 
but hang on till -PRON- release -PRON- and do -PRON- good for -PRON- mob -PRON- may be sure take -PRON- on those term pip 
righto 
and now i suppose -PRON- want more man 
-PRON- object in england can help -PRON- there say devonridge know all the good man in london and all the rotter too 
philip bentinckscrope marqui of devonridge in england and baron craigfeanteoch in scotland thus become -PRON- lieutenant while i remain in britain 
-PRON- be invaluable for -PRON- enlist the service of three young man of good family whom i know by repute 
-PRON- all have honorable record of service in the european war two serve at sea and the other with the ar force and all of -PRON- have be wound 
the last statement bring up an odd fact i be begin to note 
with the exception of the master the whole of the crew up to date have suffer from wound take on active service and when i bring in three other man two mechanic and an instrumentmaker who have serve on airship with -PRON- the tally be not break 
i nee not enlarge on the character of these man three be of the gay and welldresse rather slangy type -PRON- represent if i except one a quite big young man name billy hayne who have sleepy sam oxlike stare and no great gift of speech 
-PRON- two mechanic i know to be capable and trustworthy man quite ready to be plucky if occasion demand -PRON- but with the fine mechanic logical habit of reason speech and movement 
-PRON- third the instrumentmaker be a little slight man name thetford a perfect genius in the matter of the fine adjustment require by -PRON- trade 
i know -PRON- to be a man absorb in -PRON- work and a tireless worker 
in select these man particular care have to be take that -PRON- be without connection who would worry about -PRON- absence 
with the exception of thetford who have a sister none of the six could think of any relative or friend who would be likely to get up a hue and cry for -PRON- if a reasonable yarn of exploration be spin 
i arrange that money should be send at regular interval from new orlean to sister and that -PRON- should write to -PRON- as if occupy in that city 
within a fortnight of -PRON- arrival in england i be on -PRON- way back to america with seven man 
lippencott have waste no time 
the clutha be ready for sea and a good part of -PRON- cargo have be stow 
-PRON- have find paper to account for -PRON- voyage and have create the amazona exploration company to account for -PRON- store 
-PRON- embark young lippencott steve curtis and sam smither together with the english member of -PRON- crew and under -PRON- command the good ship clutha set out in fair weather for the brazil 
through the jungle make manaos without trouble for apart from thetford all -PRON- man be more than amateur sailor and engineer 
i do some business at manaos connect with the buying out of a moribund trading company and -PRON- proceed on -PRON- voyage upstream 
by this business -PRON- make a good acquisition 
at a place high up the negro where -PRON- be join by the water of another river there stand an ancient wooden bungalow with storehouse attach which have belong to the moribund company 
some distance above the compound the placid flow of the negro be break by rapid impassable for any craft whatever and below the compound some kilometre downstream the tributary tumble into the negro over shallow rapid that seem to put any navigation of -PRON- also out of the question 
but to a point not very far distant from the back of the storehouse a creek run up from the second river 
-PRON- be only a question of a short portage therefore to get good into flatbottome craft for navigate the tributary and -PRON- be plain sailing or as near plain sailing as be possible in such country to tug barge right up via the rio innominata to the plateau of the scar 
there be place -PRON- be true where -PRON- would have to get to work with spade and mattock to clear -PRON- passage but on this point there be nothing that could not ultimately be overcome by willing hand 
the tree line the bank of the tributary and of the innominata mostly branch over -PRON- water an arch of dense foliage which make the voyage one of halflight through the great part of -PRON- length 
-PRON- berth the clutha by the bungalow and store and with the aid of -PRON- new derrick begin to unload the store 
in this work philip marqui of devonridge sweat like any laborer of blo untinge by blue and the three other man about town messrs 
hayne fitzalan and greyson as also the two american boy lippencott and curtis take -PRON- coat off and work with equal zest 
-PRON- be willing and handy beyond -PRON- dear hope 
brook and dane the two mechanic throw -PRON- into the work with the cool precision of man accustom to handle machinery all -PRON- life and -PRON- eye gleam over the fine piece of plant -PRON- see among the cargo 
little thetford instal -PRON- as tallyman and check the invoice while sam smither take -PRON- great bulk to wherever -PRON- be handy and i imagine begin to have hope of decrease -PRON- weight by the violence of -PRON- exercise 
smither chief job after the unloading of the clutha be the put together of two flatbottomed barge for as indicate earlier sam have be a shipwright in -PRON- day 
until that task be accomplish sam be in charge of operation and -PRON- work be excellent 
-PRON- have bring two small powerboat on the deck of the clutha and these be transport to the creek behind the storehouse 
-PRON- be a matter of week before -PRON- have the barge on the backwater and -PRON- store or part of -PRON- load into -PRON- 
-PRON- would have to make at least two journey before the whole of the cargo could be get up to the cave 
sam smither be leave behind in charge of the storehouse and the moor clutha and at last have acquire the job where -PRON- could just sit and think 
the prospect of week of isolation do not daunt the stout warrant officer in the least and i know that in the unlikely event of visitor no enquiry would get past -PRON- tremendous placidity and bovine lack of expression 
sleepy sara be -PRON- last link with the outside world 
-PRON- voyage to the plateau be toilsome and arduous to the point nearly of torture 
there be now no question of portage as with the canoe 
time and again -PRON- be hold up until -PRON- could clear -PRON- passage 
-PRON- may move a fallen tree that lie across the river no simple task where the tough undergrowth and silted weed of year impede -PRON- only to find a kilometre further on that a similar task await -PRON- 
-PRON- carve and dig -PRON- way with saw and axe and spade 
-PRON- skin and clothing be scratch and rent by thorn 
insect bite -PRON- bloxlthirsty brute that -PRON- be until -PRON- face be swell out of recognition 
but -PRON- keep on ever with commendable cheerfulness where -PRON- crew be concern and -PRON- tug -PRON- barge behind -PRON- all the way 
and after week and week of toil the nine ragamuffin that -PRON- have become sail into the cavern of the plateau with iierhap a trifle more dignity than -PRON- appearance be warrant for 
build the workshop find the garrison of three in good order 
the master if -PRON- can not be say -PRON- be in good health for -PRON- never be that at least be -PRON- selfcontained and indomitable self 
grumstock and higgin grin cheerfully and take pain to tell -PRON- that -PRON- have never be so hard drive in -PRON- life nor have -PRON- ever meet anyone for whom -PRON- would sooner work than for the master 
that -PRON- have be work be evident 
the livingroom floor have be level and big window have be hew to the face of the north cliff 
space enough have be provide for over fifty man and clean healthy barrack -PRON- make 
the two seaman have become fair hunter as witness the store of dry venison provide which with bacon from wild pig have be cure under direction from the chief 
the laboratory now be well set out and -PRON- only need the instrument -PRON- have bring up and electric power to be as complete and as any in the world 
the chief welcome -PRON- new adherent in a way that bind -PRON- to -PRON- at once 
the tremendous personal magnetism of the man leap out of -PRON- frail tenement to master -PRON- even as -PRON- charm 
-PRON- explain the possibility of the cavern to -PRON- and do not minimize the amount of work which would have to be do but notwithstanding the starkness of -PRON- doctrine of labor -PRON- fire -PRON- with the romance of the scheme 
if -PRON- promise to drive -PRON- hard -PRON- welcome the promise 
that night as -PRON- rest after the labor of -PRON- voyage to the plateau steve curtis be not too weary to play -PRON- guitar and sing to -PRON- or to whistle 
-PRON- be a marvellous performance which enthral -PRON- two seamen higgin and grumstock so that -PRON- be open of mouth and eye to an astonishing degree 
the lilt of negro melody be so haunt that the morning find every man hum or whistle at -PRON- work 
a good sign i think 
the chief look in at the concert and stay a little then go back to -PRON- work 
i find -PRON- in -PRON- laboratory before go to bed 
ah seton -PRON- say be glad -PRON- look in 
-PRON- crew be distinctly promise 
i like that boy curtis with the guitar 
-PRON- be an acquisition 
and the rest seem good metal 
i congratulate -PRON- and -PRON- glad -PRON- be pleased sir 
the little man thetford be -PRON- 
-PRON- have skilful hand and intelligence -PRON- instrumentmaker sir 
i think -PRON- will find -PRON- useful in the laboratory be sure i shall if i be any judge of man 
goodnight seton 
-PRON- have do well 
next morning be devoted to unload the barge 
-PRON- land the various piece of plant as near -PRON- ultimate basis as -PRON- could the oilplant to -PRON- proper cave the machine in -PRON- shop the instrument by the laboratory 
when the unloading be do the whole gang with the exception of the two mechanic 
brook and dane and thetford go off under the charge of devonridge to fetch up the remainder of the store while -PRON- man concentrate on fix a temporary electric supply to the laboratory 
the power for run the dynamo -PRON- get from a small petrol engine and both these -PRON- bed on the solid rock with deepset bolt and concrete 
the accumulator and transformer for bring the voltage up to the high figure require by the chief for -PRON- work -PRON- lay down in a little cave near -PRON- laboratory 
this work occupy -PRON- two or three day but -PRON- finish -PRON- to the satisfaction who then take thetford into the laboratory and become deeply absorbed 
the measuring up of the cave and the setting out of the plan for the machineshop the dynamos and the turbine be -PRON- next task but brook dane and -PRON- have much of -PRON- finish with several of the machinebed level and drill for the bolt before the barge party return with the remainder of the first cargo 
some of the plant now arrive be heavy and -PRON- be oblige to cut down large tree and float -PRON- into the cave to make sheer for lift -PRON- 
-PRON- economize effort by lift the heavy piece right to -PRON- bed 
-PRON- most difficult task be the setting of the main for the turbine but -PRON- manage -PRON- by construct a strong flume of wood to divert the stream from -PRON- course a little so that -PRON- could work dryshod in -PRON- natural channel 
by dint of hew out portion of a side tunnel from the stream -PRON- secure an excellent setting for the hydraulic main and these be conduct to where the turbine be conveniently place at one end of the workshop floor 
-PRON- be fortunate in the matter of concrete 
the rock of the cavern be free from clay and have nothing in -PRON- to hinder the close and strong binding of the cement 
the chief select -PRON- quarry for -PRON- after sample the stone from several of the minor cave 
-PRON- stonebreaker be billy hayne and devonridge the latter insist -PRON- be fully qualified for the job by be able to sing one song call stonecracker john 
-PRON- sing the ditty as -PRON- do -PRON- work with such unremitting ardor that even the monosyllabic hayne be move to profane eloquence 
-PRON- be necessary that all the heavy work should be do before the company be break up for a further voyage to civilization 
-PRON- run out of cement for example and certain of the plant have not be at new orlean when the clutha make -PRON- first trip 
but month pass lefore -PRON- have the turbine in work order with the big dynamo sleep beside -PRON- or have all the machine lay out with -PRON- motor and switch 
yet when i look along the cavern and see the water gleam under the blaze of powerful arc the array of machine under -PRON- cover the waterfall harness to -PRON- use and the dmamo convert -PRON- power i find -PRON- strange to realize that over a year have pass since i first paddle into the cavern 
much have be do in the time and the day have flash by on swift wing all the more swift because the work have hold -PRON- happily absorb 
i could say with the chief that -PRON- have do well 
but -PRON- have only make a start even then 
an amazing discovery i the work do by the mechanical and laboring section of the crew could be fairly commend the brain of the community have seldom sleep 
in the laboratory with the help of the now enthusiastic thetford the master have be work out many of -PRON- problem 
in -PRON- spare time i have start to design an airship and have make work drawing for -PRON- construction 
to this the chief bent very frequently -PRON- train and fertile mind 
-PRON- brood over -PRON- drawing correct -PRON- here add to -PRON- there and there be not a stroke of -PRON- pencil but outline some amazing idea 
-PRON- would concentrate on -PRON- own problem which be many and varied and for relaxation -PRON- would walk out of -PRON- laboratory to make clear some difficulty of the work gang 
thetford worship -PRON- and would slave with the tool of -PRON- trade far into the night on the model and instrument conceive by the chief 
a nod from the master be sufficient to make any member of the crew call up the last ounce of energy for -PRON- service 
but though the chief drive -PRON- hard -PRON- be always by -PRON- example and never by a word 
and -PRON- drive -PRON- harder than any 
there be time when -PRON- would not see -PRON- for day on end when -PRON- would watch little thetford creep to -PRON- bed exhausted night after night and would know that the chief have not seek sleep in all the hour 
these period be anxious for -PRON- and for all of -PRON- for i know with the other that the agony of the terrible burn on -PRON- tortured body rob -PRON- of the slight chance of rest 
-PRON- dread be that -PRON- spirit would break under the strain 
i remember one night when sixty hour have pass unbroken by sleep for the chief 
eleven of -PRON- sit silent in the livingroom while thetford sprawl exhausted on -PRON- bed and -PRON- have not the heart even to play card 
-PRON- whisper among -PRON- pray in -PRON- heart that -PRON- leader could relax and find rest 
and suddenly -PRON- stand at the entrance to -PRON- cave 
-PRON- face be calm and placid and -PRON- mild blue eye deep sink though -PRON- be in -PRON- beautiful face be full of something like a gentle wonder 
-PRON- nod to -PRON- with the strange little gravity which be -PRON- near approach to a smile and -PRON- step into the chamber to cross to the sleep thetford asleep -PRON- say 
lucky thetford but -PRON- drive -PRON- too hard poor fellow 
a good man who be -PRON- injure -PRON- hand today -PRON- ask as -PRON- turn to -PRON- 
-PRON- be greyson who have have -PRON- finger crush under a heavy weight but -PRON- hide the damage hand 
i know that the reticence would not suit the chief so i nod in direction 
greyson be -PRON- say the chief 
let -PRON- see greyson 
yes -PRON- say as -PRON- examine the damage finger -PRON- have give -PRON- a bad crush greyson 
no bone break however 
in spite of -PRON- pluck greyson shiver a little 
yes 
-PRON- must be painful and pain be hard to combat the chief murmur -PRON- who could combat -PRON- so come let -PRON- dress -PRON- for -PRON- 
i have a lotion -PRON- cross to the rough cabinet where -PRON- keep -PRON- small store of drug and so on and take out a bottle 
then with infinite tenderness -PRON- dress the hand with the five finger leave -PRON- to execute the mercy be rejoice to tell -PRON- gentleman -PRON- go on that i believe -PRON- can carry out -PRON- campaign without the shedding of blood without take life 
i see -PRON- work but -PRON- see nothing of mine 
i must tell -PRON- that i have discover a gas which will cause sleep for a number of hour 
-PRON- go on to explain the anaesthetize gas which be afterwards to give -PRON- of the league such power 
the man liven up to the interest of -PRON- and -PRON- suddenly turn to steve curtis 
-PRON- do not sing and play tonight steven -PRON- say 
why do -PRON- neglect -PRON- guitar 
chief steve choke in exclaim 
-PRON- havenot sleep for three night 
i i didnot like donot think there be profit in watch -PRON- steven the chief reprove -PRON- gently 
-PRON- must not do -PRON- 
come sing 
-PRON- will not disturb thetford 
sing the little song about the lonely cabin 
steve reach for -PRON- guitar and though -PRON- quaver over the first line -PRON- soon find -PRON- voice ole cabin in de cawnatch 
shingle all adroppin ftom de roof 
look lak evehbody go away some place wheh dey go to stay 
love ole mammy wheh be yu at 
kindes ole mammy be yu daid an go 
why do ah leave ma home an run away from de lil ole cabin wheh ah be bawn no smoke risin from de kitchen flue no light shinin froo de do 
nobody home to welcome yu but what s dat creakin on de flo love ole mammy an ma daddy too 
be yu daid an gone from -PRON- 
oh why do ah up an run away from de kindes ole mammy ah will evah see 
empty an sad not even a houn do standin open do broke de latch think be oin an not stay aroun de lil ole cabin in de cawnpatch excellent steven say the chief 
-PRON- excel -PRON- ever lie -PRON- guitar aside because -PRON- think i have not sleep 
i like to hear -PRON- 
i be grateful indeed vhen i hear -PRON- 
come seton 
i have to show -PRON- something 
i follow to receive a gentle wigging for allow the boy to be disturb about -PRON- 
now -PRON- char fellow say -PRON- when the wigging be over want to show -PRON- what i have find in the gas which -PRON- sample for -PRON- some month ago i have have many sample since 
-PRON- understand how helium be discover i take -PRON- 
i nod 
then i nee not explain the significance of the line in the spectrum 
no sir 
i understand that roughly 
very well then 
i will show -PRON- the line which be give by the gas from -PRON- cave 
-PRON- have an elaborate arrangement of tube and instrument set out on a low table and a sort of magio lantern focusse on a white screen stretch over a wall of the cave 
there come a crackle from one of the tube and an intense eery light 
-PRON- touch -PRON- arm and point to the screen 
there project on the white surface be an elongate oblong of rainbow color break by bright and dark bar 
look at -PRON- well -PRON- dear seton the chief say quietly 
-PRON- see before -PRON- the spectrum of a new element an element that may well upset the exist periodic table of the chemical element 
-PRON- be -PRON- gas mix with helium 
the bright yellow bar to the extreme left be the characteristic bar of helium 
but this be new quite new 
-PRON- touch a switch and the bright patch on the screen disappear 
-PRON- turn up the laboratory light be now face with the usual difficulty in a new science of use old term loosely to fit new idea -PRON- say 
the atom as formerly understand be go 
but let -PRON- put -PRON- loosely 
-PRON- new gas resemble helium absolutely in chemical nature in so far that -PRON- have no power of combining and exist free as single atom without have the ability to form any compound whatever 
since i judge -PRON- atomic weight another misnomer seton -PRON- atomic weight to be of that of hydrogen which up to now have be the light element know -PRON- will understand what a revolution -PRON- discovery will cause in scientific calculation 
the gas reservoir -PRON- discovery by the chief of the new element which -PRON- name aitlwn lead -PRON- to think that the design of the airship as set out would have to be alter but -PRON- declare that any drastic change would be unnecessary 
i have design the vessel to have -PRON- lift from helium 
-PRON- leader have propose to manufacture that gas by pass electricity at an extremely high voltage through certain of the rare metal from the wolframtype ore i think which -PRON- be positive abound in the volcanic pipe -PRON- call the red scar 
but the finding first of the helium in the gas cave and second -PRON- discovery of the new gas aithon in great quantity than the helium -PRON- have lay open the possibility of an easy method of secure -PRON- lifting power 
-PRON- shelve all other work for the time be but the tapping of the reservoir from which the chief believe that gas percolate into the upper cave be draw 
-PRON- could see that the gas in the cave have mean of get out above but -PRON- low fringe varied little day by day which seem to indicate that the escape overhead be continually be make good by fresh supply 
the gas in -PRON- be harmless 
-PRON- be only -PRON- ousting of the necessary oxygen for breathing that make work in the cave an impossibility 
-PRON- therefore take step to fan the mixture of helium and aithon from the cave and to keep a constant supply of oxygen procure by the chief from electrolysis of the cave water circulate in -PRON- 
-PRON- bring up load of concrete into the cave sacrifice for the moment the stuff intend for dam the oilreservoir cabin and -PRON- bind -PRON- thoroughly to the thickness of half a metre or more into the cave wall by steel bolt and dowel 
when this concrete be set -PRON- find that -PRON- have stop the percolation of the gas into the cave so that the fan and oxygen be no longer necessary 
in the concrete wall -PRON- have bed a cap pipe with a side stopcock to a pressure gauge and through the aperture of which the hinge cap lie back with -PRON- bolt ready -PRON- insert -PRON- drill to the rock wall of the cave 
for the drilling -PRON- power be derive from a small electric motor bolt to the floor and be lead to the drill by a flexible armored tube on the bowden wire principle 
of this process of drilling i have but slight knowledge as have the other member of the crew but with the theory of the business which the chief apparently have at -PRON- finger tip and with liie natural handiness of the seaman and mechanic -PRON- make shift to achieve something of a job 
towards the end of -PRON- drilling the gas begin to creep through past the drill and -PRON- have to cap the pipe and lie off until -PRON- could make arrangement for clear the cave 
the chief contrive to have two oxygen helmet make for -PRON- and -PRON- use in an emergency 
drilling be resume with the fan go and oxygen blow into the cave and -PRON- soon become apparent that -PRON- be near the inner side of the reservoir wall 
from the amount of gas now stream into the cave the chief anticipate an enormous pressure so i have a long crowbar reeve through the ring of the cap in readiness 
-PRON- be well that -PRON- do so for suddenly the drill break through the rock topple with a thud first up against the concrete and then be knock back on -PRON- tripod over to the other side of the cave 
the gas whistle out into the cave at enormous pressure -PRON- force as strong as a typhoon 
fortunately i be a very heavy man or -PRON- may have have disaster 
i be wear the oxygen helmet as be the chief so i spring for the cap of the inset pipe and throw -PRON- weight on the lever 
slowly the cap go over though -PRON- take -PRON- all -PRON- time as the phrase be and every muscle in -PRON- body be protest at the strain 
the chief be by -PRON- side and -PRON- slip the hinge bolt back into -PRON- flange then calmly stop to pick up and hand -PRON- a spann 
i screw the bolt tight and the rest be easy 
there be two more bolt but -PRON- only have to be slip through -PRON- hole and screw home 
-PRON- have the cap on and the gas be harness 
-PRON- now have to turn -PRON- attention to one of the driller who have be overcome 
-PRON- be brook knock over by the throw drill 
the other have manage to scramble out of the cave 
i pick -PRON- up in -PRON- arm and carry -PRON- into the clear air where the chief attend -PRON- 
-PRON- quickly recover and though -PRON- be a sick man for the well part of the day -PRON- make light of -PRON- experience sanng that not many people could boast of have be nearly drown on dry land 
when the gas be clear of the cave the master and i go back to find what pressure -PRON- have while a number of the man troop after -PRON- 
there be the faint suspicion of a gleam in the mild eye as -PRON- turn the handle of the stopcock to the gauge 
the hand of the dial tremble violently then swing to forty atmosphere indicate where -PRON- remain steady forty atmosphere the master say quietly great reservoir 
ah seton -PRON- be almost sacrilege to tap -PRON- the product of nature slow process through seon of time 
design the airship a nd now a trip to the outer world become urgent 
-PRON- be short of the store and plant make necessary by -PRON- development of the cave resource 
again -PRON- have to complete the airship design in the light of the new gas 
the chief make test of a sample draw straight from the reservoir and find -PRON- to be almost pure aithon 
the specific gravity of the mixture -PRON- declare to be close on five time less than that of hydrogen so that with -PRON- design for a heliumlifte ship -PRON- margin for play be enormous 
in the original design the total fix weight work out at about thirtyfive thousand kilogramme with a disposable lift of under twenty thousand 
the small proportion of disposable lift to total fix weight be due to strengthening of the structure and the sacrifice of carry capacity to that end 
-PRON- be not anticipate that -PRON- should have to carry heavy armament or bomb or that sort of thing or a very numerous crew 
with the advantage of the much light aithon i urge the master to permit a further stiffening of the structure and -PRON- agree 
-PRON- thus avoid the weakness which have always characterize even the good of rigid dirigible 
the length and mould of the vessel -PRON- do not alter 
-PRON- be design to two hundred metre in length over all twentythree metre in diameter with an extreme height of twentyseven 
in cross section -PRON- be twelveside and float with one of the facet as a broad keel 
this give -PRON- a flat top and two vertical facet one on either side 
-PRON- join the angle of these horizontal and vertical facet each to the angle squarely opposite with lattice girder of duralumin so that the structure of the vessel be in fact a broad hollow girder of crossshape section through all -PRON- length 
-PRON- body be short and parallel with long rounded bow and an extended tapering stern the duodecagonal section be hold throughout 
the crossshape section of the longitudinal girder permit the running of a chamber seven metre wide from the point where -PRON- bow begin to round to that where -PRON- begin to taper to the stern a length of ninety metre 
on the main gangway or keel level this chamber be divide off as follow from fore to aft first the room hold the control connection from the navigate cabin which be suspend below the two be join by a ladder next two sleeping cabin side by side intend for the chief and -PRON- behind these cabin further aft a big companionway run down into the navigation room next a space lead into an alleyway which have cubicle on either side to the number of fourteen each cubicle take two man and be provide with two low berth and two locker next come the engine room with the power for work the gas tap and so on for raise and lower a gondola to and from the main structure of the ship and also for create the enormously high voltage electricity necessary for some of the marvellous instrument here also a stairway give access to the observation top and two door lead out to the amidship power unit one on either quarter behind the engine room be a diningsaloon and lounge for the crew with a stair down at -PRON- after end to the stem engine and control cabin 
the galley and larder stand over this companionway 
aft of the forward navigation cabin two power unit port and starboard be suspend 
the engine here be hp each of the horizontally opposed cylinder type with direct drive to the propeller 
-PRON- weigh just over half as many kilogramme as -PRON- have unit of horsepower and -PRON- be so arrange each in -PRON- own little engine room that the attendant mechanic could easily get at -PRON- 
the amidship engine thrust at the level of the main gangway thus about four metre high than the forward engine 
-PRON- be also much wide apart be about sixteen metre from crank to crank 
these engine be of similar weight and horsepower to the forward unit 
the after controlcabin have two engine behind -PRON- thrust on the same line as the forward one 
the whole of this after cabin swing horizontally on a pivot engine include on a strong colmnn flange on roller bearing the idea be to hasten the turn of the ship by the side thrust of the propeller astern 
the swing of the after cabin be electrically control from the forward one but -PRON- be possible to work -PRON- from -PRON- 
the only thing not affect by the swing of the cabin be -PRON- binnacle which be fix to the stationary column on which the cabin pivot thus the lubber mark of the gyrocompass always point to the real head of the ship 
this old idea of steering be augment by an ordinary rudder 
for the normal climb and descent -PRON- have the usual boxfin astern but the genius of the chief find -PRON- a much great power in this direction 
i anticipate the chronology of the story by tell of this feature at the moment but -PRON- may be as well explain here as later 
-PRON- liquefy the aithon at absolute zero and carry a big reserve in steel container 
owe to -PRON- immense lifting power -PRON- be able to have spring hoop for keep -PRON- ballonet rigid each be fit with an automatic pressure valve 
by an elaborate system of pipe stopcock and valve all electrically control from either navigate cabin -PRON- be able to clear these ballonet of gas or air at will 
when -PRON- want to rise quickly -PRON- pump the air from the forward ballonet and force into -PRON- the aithon expand to gas by have be spray into a slightly heated chamber 
thus -PRON- upset the balance of the ship and have the lifting power forward help of course by the thrust of the propeller 
by turn a graduate dial in the cabin -PRON- be able gradually to fill the ballonet one after the other or empty -PRON- fore to aft or aft to forward as -PRON- choose 
thus when -PRON- want a quick descent -PRON- empty the forward ballonet of gas and fill -PRON- with air bring the nose down 
by reason of these improvement all make possible by the discovery of the aithon -PRON- be capable of and the structure permit quick maneuver which would have buckle the ordinary dirigible at once 
smither toucan i be -PRON- task to set out work drawing of the improve airship 
this be a matter of enormous labor for one pair of hand involve as -PRON- do a mass of drawing and tracing to various scale from mm to cm and fullsize for certain detail 
owe to the shortage of material which could not be remedie until the drawing of the airship be ready to pass into the hand of traver lippencott at new orlean the crew have time on -PRON- hand so i enlist the service of dave lippencott and fitzalan who i find in addition to be capable engineer have some idea of mechanical drawing 
-PRON- act as tracer for -PRON- 
-PRON- improve as -PRON- go on and the time come when the close inspection of -PRON- effort by the chief thetford and -PRON- could find no error either in draw or in figure 
while this work be in hand the remainder of the crew begin to try drill for the oil with an electrically drive rotary drill 
-PRON- succeed in strike oil at a depth of one hundred and thirtythree metre and as with the gas on the opposite side of the main cavern find an enormous pressure 
-PRON- be a good quality of oil pale sherry brown in color and not at all the tarcolored viscous stuff one expect to see 
-PRON- have a paraffin basis and readily ignite as -PRON- be fresh from the earth 
the voyage to the outer world could no longer be postpone 
the drawing of the airship be ready and -PRON- need the piping for gas and oil and have to bring up the refinery plant 
of the company only the chief thetford deyonridge and hayne which last two be promise -PRON- some hunting in the slack time and grumstock be to remain behind 
grumstock come with -PRON- for the first part of the journey 
-PRON- find sleepy sam smither as placid and content as ever to the great glee of higgin and grumstock who find much amusement in chaff -PRON- old shipmate 
in the month that smither have be solitary not a single white man have -PRON- see 
-PRON- have capture and tame a toucan and the bird be -PRON- sole companion 
i have be rather anxious about smither whether -PRON- resolution and phlegm would indeed be capable of sustain that dreadful isolation but i honestly believe even now that the stout shipwright really enjoy -PRON- own company 
-PRON- health be excellent a remarkable thing in a man so shortnecked 
-PRON- have improve the storehouse greatly inside but have carefully neglect all outward appearance 
the place be desolate and overgrow to a forlornness that may have make the heart sink and even the clutha be hide by creeper 
but if smither have allow -PRON- to hide -PRON- naturally -PRON- have look after -PRON- wage bitter war on the ant which may have eat into -PRON- timber and keep -PRON- engineroom a picture of tidiness 
when the clutha be ready for -PRON- trip downstream grumstock offer to bear smither company for a day or two before return to the plateau 
well jack say smither if -PRON- like to muck in wi nosey an -PRON- for a day or two good an well -PRON- be welcome 
but -PRON- ainot no debatin sassiety -PRON- be an -PRON- i can tell -PRON- that 
nosey of course be the toucan 
well what do ye do with -PRON- all the time 
grumstock demand with an irritated scratch of -PRON- head 
nosey an -PRON- say smither solemnly brort thinkin ter wot ther paper call a fine art that bird -PRON- go on with an impressive wave of -PRON- slim pipe that bird a wonder 
-PRON- be an mell sit fer hour lookin at each other thinkin dye see an seen nosey that pensive asd make -PRON- say e ad brain in be beak sit there thinkin an thinkin till ye begin ter wonder wot tremenjous idea get 
-PRON- can see -PRON- swellin up in be ead then suddenlike give isself a dust under ther wing 
an anybody can see got that point settle all right 
ah get -PRON- beat for thinkin any day o ther week say a monkeyd be more company higgin assert 
ah tom ah fer -PRON- 
bird of a feather make good company smither say pointedly monkey get no brain an suit -PRON- splendid -PRON- mark get plenty 
oh all right sam say the abash higgin 
if -PRON- fancy old solomon as much as that good an well 
but a bird like that d give -PRON- the creep 
possibly tom possibly smither say with solemn pride bird like nosey want some livin up to stay for a day or two grumstock announce if only for something to laugh at right 
jack smither say placidly 
stay an advertise -PRON- vacant mind as much as ye like -PRON- wither quite unwrung by this peculiar extension of hospitality grumstock elect to remain and -PRON- and the stolid sam see -PRON- drop down the river one morning early 
the last glimpse -PRON- have of the pair show sleepy sam sit like a graven image on the step of the wharf hand on knee gaze fixedly downstream after -PRON- while grumstock beside -PRON- be regard -PRON- old shipmate perplexedly and be scratch -PRON- head in a state border on despair 
further equipment reach new orlean in good shape and find traver lippencott with a cargo ready for -PRON- 
this include -PRON- refining plant for the oil pipe tank for the pure spirit and in fine the last of the material apart from the airship -PRON- 
there be also a large amount of food tin and otherwise cement grain and when -PRON- be ready to return coop of chicken and duck 
i hand -PRON- the airship drawing and fix a date for -PRON- return to pick up the part 
-PRON- arrange between -PRON- that the part and the material should be invoice to a socalle north african aerial transport company and that the manifest and bill of lading should be make out for some of the north african port 
-PRON- build up a ramified and intricate deceit not because -PRON- would have be difficult to get clearance for -PRON- cargo which be innocent enough but to hide -PRON- trace beyond recovery when the hue and cry would be raise against -PRON- perhaps year hence 
at the time when the part of the ship be order there be a great boom in ihe building of dirigible in america and europe and -PRON- anticipate no trouble in 4iaving the order fill 
but to make assurance sure and o ee that every single part be bmitte to accuftte testing i ask brook to stay 4n america until everything be collect at new orlean 
brooks be a little chagrin at the prospect of banishment from the plateau but 
i point out to -PRON- that there be nothing leave in the cave but rough work or job that -PRON- could not tackle ntil -PRON- could have the part of the airship bring there and -PRON- consent 
-PRON- be a good man brook who be not likely to get drunk or talk and -PRON- be thoroughly tapable of the business of see -PRON- order properly carry out 
-PRON- be to draw upon lippencott for money -PRON- treat -PRON- generously and in thed imagine the prospect of travel importantly about the united state rather take hold of -PRON- for -PRON- set tabout the business with apparent pleasure 
-PRON- be prime with a clearcut and circumstantial story to trot out to enquirer and -PRON- even go to the length of printing prospectus of the company for -PRON- 
this point be a trifle overdone for though the scheme outline be of the mad i believe -PRON- have difficulty later in keep people from try to invest in -PRON- 
the two new orlean young man lippencott and curtis make the most of -PRON- leave from the amazona exploration company and trot -PRON- fellow explorer fitzalan and greyson about the city in great style to the evident edification of the latter 
-PRON- rope in two other man for the company one of -PRON- a young oil engineer from texas 
at last however the cargo be stow and -PRON- set off on -PRON- return voyage 
less than a fortnight bring -PRON- off manaos and there -PRON- have a slight care 
off the city -PRON- be board by a brazilian official who insist on inspect -PRON- cargo 
but -PRON- paper be in order and in the end though i fancy -PRON- think -PRON- a trifle mad -PRON- thank -PRON- warmly for help to develop the resource of -PRON- fatherland 
-PRON- sacrifice on -PRON- and -PRON- fellow a bottle or two of very sweet champagne store aboard for just such an emergency and when -PRON- drop -PRON- ever the side into -PRON- own boat i do not think -PRON- be in a condition to remember whether -PRON- be go upstream or down 
-PRON- be shout fond farewell to -PRON- and -PRON- protestation of undye amity to -PRON- even as -PRON- engine begin to turn for the run up the river 
some week later the chief be welcome -PRON- and -PRON- new comrade to the plateau of the red scar 
a lesson in mining -PRON- young texas engineer lin greensleeve by name fall in with the idea of the league right away and the other new comrade matthew 
-PRON- insist on the be little behind for enthusiasm 
both man have fight for america in france and -PRON- tally of wounded man be unbroken by -PRON- adherence 
greensleeve pronounce -PRON- drilling and capping of the well to be quite professional and wax eloquent on the quality of -PRON- soil 
-PRON- set about the erection of the fractional distil plant and rule out as unnecessary -PRON- idea of form a reservoir 
-PRON- superintend the piping of the oil direct to the still lay down the tank for the gasoline as -PRON- call -PRON- and when that be do take over the piping jof the aithon to the hangar cave and to the site of -PRON- pressure nd freezing tank 
meantime matthew who understand what may be call raw lumber have organize a party for treefelle 
tall tree be fell and dress down the river and be tow by launch intp the cave to make the stock for erect -PRON- airship 
the putting up of the stock when sufficient timber be collect fall to -PRON- and the seamen of the company 
i be incline to drag that master shipwright smither from -PRON- splendid isolation so that -PRON- may have the benefit of -PRON- professional experience but i forbore and disturb -PRON- and nosey only once when i sail down to thrash out a knotty problem with -PRON- 
-PRON- manage however without -PRON- personal supervision to put up quite shapely scaffold in readiness for the arrival of the airship part 
in the midst of these preoccupation lin greensleeve make a discovery which be the beginning of a series of thrill for -PRON- 
in the east wall of the main cavern whence come jour waterpower and -PRON- aithon gas run up close to the edge of the redtopped pipe a series of vary tiftmel wander seemingly the driedup course of ancient hot spring 
these bore up to the surface in several place to end sometimes in high sinter cone on the top of the plateau 
the sweet air of the cavern be due in measure to the ventilation that these passage bring about for in many of -PRON- one could feel the rush of air 
-PRON- occur to the versatile mind of lin greensleeve that if -PRON- could search out a separate passage and connect -PRON- up to the furnace of -PRON- refining plant -PRON- would be in possession of a natural flue and save -PRON- a lot of trouble 
to this end -PRON- drag -PRON- off on a tour of investigation among those upper passage 
for hour -PRON- scramble and crawl with pocket compas and torch through tortuous way check direction and measure distance 
among other thing -PRON- discover a good passage up to the top of the plateau but that fact be temporarily lose sight of in the amazing find that follow 
lin discover -PRON- flue to a certain extent 
the only thing that prevent -PRON- from be an excellent flue be the fact that -PRON- come to an abrupt end underground 
lin however have -PRON- measurement which be all out owe to an unseen influence on -PRON- compass as will transpire and -PRON- be ready to wager that by hew through for a certain distance -PRON- would connect up with another of the dry spring course and so have a good draught to the outer air by one of the sinter cone 
since the idea be merely a fancy of -PRON- and since the other member of the company have -PRON- own particular task to perform that day -PRON- determine to carry out the operation by -PRON- but since lin be one of the most cheerfully determined devil -PRON- have ever be -PRON- fortune to meet and the most engaging companion withal i volunteer to help -PRON- 
i know nothing of mining but i think -PRON- be not too late to learn a little 
lin decide that -PRON- be useless to attack the barrier with the pick for the rock be a particularly hard limestone and as -PRON- put -PRON- the only method be by a shot or -PRON- descend therefore to the storecave for a stick of explosive or two detonator and a coil a drill and a forehammer and other weapon necessary for the attack 
i now receive -PRON- first lesson in mining 
the little chamber be stiflingly hot for some reason but ve commence operation undeterred 
-PRON- instruction be to hold the drill while lin smote -PRON- and to turn -PRON- slightly after each stroke 
how the man could deliver such blow in such a cramped position i be unable to say definitely but i take -PRON- that for the hundredth time i be in the position of the neophyte admire that precision which belong only to the master of any craft 
-PRON- or rather lin soon have a goodly hole sink and into this -PRON- insert the with -PRON- detonator all prepared 
-PRON- put in some sort of tamping and -PRON- retire round a corner or two to where the coil stand ready in connection 
hug the wall seton lin order 
now -PRON- drop -PRON- weight on the plunger 
from the cavern round the corner there come a dull roar and a gush of hot air come rush down the passage 
i be hug the wall accord to instruction but be almost drag away from -PRON- 
-PRON- be among particularly pungent fume 
foof foof lin splutter 
this will soon pass away when the little draught get down to -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot be poison seton but -PRON- derned unpleasant 
-PRON- wait some considerable time but the little draught do not get down to -PRON- 
funny say lin could have bet -PRON- would be through 
wait a bit then let go and see 
-PRON- retire to the end of the passage above -PRON- refinery and while -PRON- wait -PRON- smoke and yarn 
when greensleeve think -PRON- would be safe -PRON- return to the culdesac 
the place be block by a heap of rubble which lin and i start to clear away 
when -PRON- have make a way to the shatter wall lin fall to flash the light of -PRON- torch on -PRON- 
-PRON- my -PRON- exclaim through to a dyke rock 
gentleman donot snigger 
i didnot expect that 
well here go -PRON- pick up the drill and -PRON- rap the end of -PRON- against the blackish rock 
-PRON- sound hllow and -PRON- turn a grin ton -PRON- not sell -PRON- smile boss as the cornish say 
another little shot will do the business 
again -PRON- fall to drilling 
-PRON- set the stick of explosive and the tamping then go back to the coil 
once more that hollow roar the rush of hot air the pungent smell 
but even now the expect draught be absent 
lin greensleeve be puzzle and -PRON- face as -PRON- make -PRON- way back to the entrance to await the dispersing of the fume be a comic study in chasten expression canot be far out 
commander -PRON- say ruefully when -PRON- catch -PRON- smile drive deep and -PRON- be hollow too 
gentleman donot snigger 
maybe debris have fall from the roof and block the passage soon have -PRON- out if -PRON- have 
-PRON- return to the scene of the explosion after another smoke 
as -PRON- turn the last angle of the passage lin suddenly grip -PRON- arm 
now what s -PRON- verdict on that -PRON- demand and point ahead 
from the further wall there rise a strange greeny lambency silhouette the heap of rock that be pile on the cave floor 
something uncanny -PRON- be which make the hair prickle on the scalp 
a strange sense of some appalling power behind the rock grip -PRON- hard and i be fain to turn on -PRON- heel and run 
that indeed be what lin greensleeve bade -PRON- do 
get back seton -PRON- whisper 
get round the angle of rock 
i dare not think what -PRON- be but go to see 
stop lin stop 
i exclaim 
there may be fume from -PRON- get -PRON- now if there be -PRON- reply sniff though there s an unaccountable whiff of bromine or chlorine -PRON- add with a puzzle air 
get behind the rock angle seton 
i be go to see 
all in ignorance as i be i could neither stop -PRON- nor permit -PRON- to go forward 
i could not tell if -PRON- would be wise to follow -PRON- but the scot in -PRON- dictate the wait attitude to be ready to pull -PRON- out if -PRON- be in danger 
lin creep forward on -PRON- hand and toe and come back in a rush with a lump of rock 
if -PRON- what i think -PRON- be -PRON- pant either mad or drunk i donot know what say seton rattle get out of this 
i have something that may provide a clue 
the chief be the man for -PRON- 
-PRON- hurry for the entrance of the passage and climb down to the main cavern floor 
-PRON- run across the bridge that now span the lake and rush up to the laboratory 
-PRON- be bidden to enter 
lin pour out -PRON- story in a rush while the chief listen with -PRON- usual mild expression unastonishe unmoved lambent greenish glow -PRON- murmur 
let -PRON- see the rock 
lin take -PRON- out of the coat in which -PRON- have hurriedly wrap -PRON- 
-PRON- be a blackish rock with a reddish side to -PRON- and to this reddish side there be a pinkish crystalline deposit very thin 
pitchblende i think with a filling of rhodolite say the chief when -PRON- have place -PRON- on a bench to examine -PRON- 
an extraordinary combination 
look -PRON- good greensleeve seton look -PRON- charge an electroscope until the two leave be hold out at right angle to the stem 
-PRON- put the piece of rock under the globe and the leave fall at once that tell -PRON- own story the chief say 
-PRON- speciman greensleeve be highly radioactive and the pinkish salt that cling to the rhodolite side of -PRON- be one of the radium compound i should say bromide with a slight barium impurity 
-PRON- look at -PRON- mildly quizzical have cease to disbelieve in miracle seton since -PRON- find the aithon reservoir 
though the glow -PRON- describe may easily be only the fluorescence cause by a minute quantity of radium act on some substance readily so radium pure radium do not glow to the eye at least the thin deposit of radium bromide cling to the rock speciman make -PRON- really believe -PRON- have come upon a natural pocket of the metal -PRON- near completion i be not for -PRON- sholto seton onetime commander in -PRON- royal navy and always more man of -PRON- hand than of the head to venture an explanation of that marvellous polythalamous geological freak know as the plateau of the red scar nor be -PRON- mine to fathom the process of nature which bring the treasure culminate in the radium pocket to the casual and grope hand of the member of the league of the covenant 
i be fain to rest content as be -PRON- master that the gift be there for -PRON- seeking and to accept -PRON- with reverence in -PRON- heart 
but to those who seek explanation whether -PRON- be that the work of -PRON- life bid -PRON- ask or that -PRON- be po246 sesse of an idle if itch curiosity the slight note of -PRON- chief have be edit and amplify by man of science and lie open to all who have the wit to understand 
the task that lie to -PRON- hand there in the heart of the amazon forest be plain 
i have to keep the crew cheerfully at work maintain a real though carefully veil discipline and find way and mean for bring the dream of the master to realization to second in -PRON- blundering fashion in a bewilder fashion sometimes the workingout of the amazing conception of -PRON- untiring brain 
of the concrete then i have the knowledge at least to speak fairly 
of the abstract and theoretical i can only set down the result i see 
and with motive personality character i must to lapse wittingly into scot just hirple along 
-PRON- be like the master to be concern over the possible effect of the radium ray on lin greensleeve and -PRON- 
the little man who could not heal the great burn so far advanced on -PRON- own frail body make both of -PRON- strip and undergo a medicated bath and ointment preventive treatment of -PRON- own preparing 
for some time no day pass hut that -PRON- would have -PRON- appear for examination 
nothing i be convince hold terror for -PRON- fragile little chief as concerned -PRON- but under -PRON- habitual repose of manner lin and i think -PRON- read a mortal terror for -PRON- 
however that may be in the end -PRON- be pronounce to be without scathe 
member of the crew be strictly forbid to enter the passage or go near the cave until -PRON- have take step to secure the content of the radium cache which the chief on inspection declare to hold an astonishing quantity 
-PRON- have no lead in the cavern but one of the mechanic remember that the floor of the engineroom be cover with the metal and some man be send down to the wharf to rip -PRON- off and bring -PRON- to the cavern 
the chief design a leaden shield 
this have two ingeniously joint arm end in boxlike mitt which permit the handling of a little spade by one and the holding of a thick lead case in the other 
a view of the operation of case and spade be give by a periscope and light be throw on the subject by electric bulb attach to the top of the leaden screen 
when this contrivance be ready lin greensleeve and -PRON- clear away the debris on the cave floor by work with spade from behind two lead shield 
the debris be remove the working screen be push against the aperture of the cache and lin whose hand be more fit in size for the box mitt than -PRON- great fist spoon the precious salt into the case and when the crevice be clear the lid be drop home 
the treasure worth an enormous fortune be deposit in a little cave right in the heart of the cave system 
lin greensleeve now make a survey with proper instrument and find the right spot for break through into the other passage 
within a day or two the passage to the radium cave be impassable by reason of the fume from furnace 
-PRON- be not cheat for when the damper be up the roar of the draught through -PRON- furnace rival the waterfall in fill every cranny of the cavern with noise 
the position of affair with the league at this time be so -PRON- have apart from the master sixteen man signatory to the covenant for peace devonridge greyson fitzalan hayne lippencott curtis greensleeve whittaker grumstock higgin dane thetford and -PRON- thirteen at work in the cavern 
outside be traver lippencott and brook in america smither at the storehouse downriver 
-PRON- have perfect the laboratory harness the waterpower of the fall and provide ample electricity for all reqtiirement -PRON- have secure -PRON- oil supply and be able to refine -PRON- and store the pure spirit and lubricate oil and -PRON- have wax for -PRON- electrical instrument the gas for lift -PRON- airship be available in great quantity and -PRON- be able to reduce -PRON- to -PRON- liquefying constant and to store -PRON- -PRON- engineshop up to date in every particular be in full working order -PRON- have the building slip ready for the erection of the dirigible and -PRON- have the living accommodation for -PRON- full complement of fifty man all ready for occupation 
the plan of the chief and -PRON- experiment be well advanced 
-PRON- have standardize -PRON- formula for and be ready to manufacture the anaesthetize gas 
-PRON- assure -PRON- that -PRON- wais near the end of the development of the power that be to bring the world into line with the idea of the league 
in addition to this -PRON- and thetford as a relaxation for the chief have prepare numerous instrument for the navigation of -PRON- ship and have make model of many contrivance for the control and the manipulation of -PRON- lifting gas 
finally -PRON- possess a supply of radium great than have ever be know before in the world and worth enough money to set -PRON- all in luxury for the rest of -PRON- life 
in the matter of creature comfort -PRON- be very well off 
-PRON- have vegetable grow in a clearing down the river -PRON- have fish and venison and wild pig with occasional snatch of frozen beef and mutton -PRON- have of course the good of canned food milk meat and fruit and -PRON- have duck and chicken thrive in a cave at the south end of -PRON- main cavern the duck corral by wire netting 
to reach this point in -PRON- preparation have take over two year and indeed -PRON- have celebrate two christmas feast and two thanksgiving in the big livingcave of the plateau 
-PRON- have come to the stage once more when -PRON- would have to make a journey to the outside world 
by now the material for -PRON- two airship with the necessary instrument would be wait for -PRON- at new orlean and -PRON- be due to complete the number of -PRON- company 
before set out on -PRON- last voyage i put the whole of the man on construct great door for the main and small entrance of the cavern 
these -PRON- make of trelliswork in heavy scantling of wood overlay with wire net and -PRON- fix float box of soil at -PRON- basis plant quickgrowe creeper on -PRON- 
-PRON- plant well past the hinge of each flap to a good distance along the cliff on either side of -PRON- waterway 
when -PRON- return from -PRON- next voyage the entrance to -PRON- cavern be mask with luxuriant foliage 
the crew complete i devonridge dane and higgin with -PRON- to england for the purpose of recruit man 
greensleeve volunteer to find some in america as do the two lippencott and curtis 
-PRON- go carefully to work on both side of the atlantic 
in england dane do the good work among -PRON- 
-PRON- find -PRON- six skilled mechanic for whose character -PRON- could vouch 
i find five good seaman and airmea who have serve with -PRON- previously and devonridge weigh in with two excellent sportsman of -PRON- own type and a couple of man who have be on -PRON- estate 
-PRON- each keep -PRON- own party and voyage separately to new orlean where -PRON- find that lippencott and -PRON- helper have recruit sixteen good man 
there be not a man among the whole thirtyone who do not promise well and the experience of the next year at the plateau only find a single failure among -PRON- 
-PRON- total complement exclude the master now number fortyseven and still -PRON- tally of man wound in war be unbroken 
i have almost make a point of that qualification to -PRON- recruiter and -PRON- seem to have make much of -PRON- 
while -PRON- party be in england lippencott have have the clutha load but with the number of man -PRON- have to carry and the weight of -PRON- material -PRON- find that at least two journey would be necessary 
-PRON- seem hardly safe to leave any number of man to kick -PRON- heel in new orlean for some month so i determine to ship the lot at once 
the little vessel be pack but the spirit of the man be good and -PRON- bear the cramping with cheerfulness 
the voyage be make at good speed and except for have to hide the man on pass several of the river port -PRON- arrive at the storehouse without adventure 
there i give over the command to devonridge with greensleeve and curtis as junior and when the unloading be do i take the vessel without further delay downriver again for another trip to new orlean 
here i ship the last of -PRON- material and a good amount of store 
on -PRON- return to -PRON- base on the river i find devonridge wait with man to unload 
-PRON- carry -PRON- stuff upstream to the plateau 
i outline a plan i have conceive to the chief which be simply that after two further voyage to america for store -PRON- should burn -PRON- boat behind -PRON- and not go back to the outer world until -PRON- could make the trip on the ark of the covemnt 
the chief agree so when the final two voyage have be make under devonridge -PRON- run the poor trusty little clutha into a creek downstream and fell tree about -PRON- effectually conceal -PRON- where i suppose -PRON- lie bless -PRON- to this day 
-PRON- ship smither and -PRON- toucan 
nosey have about break -PRON- heart by raze the storehouse and bungalow to the ground and as -PRON- proceed upstream -PRON- put charge of giant powder under tall tree behind -PRON- so that -PRON- fall across the water securely block any passage behind -PRON- 
in a month or two the way would be nigh impassable 
thus -PRON- cut -PRON- off from civilization except for that which -PRON- carry with -PRON- and a full year elapse before the world hear of -PRON- again 
even in the cavern -PRON- be shut from pry eye for the great door be now a mass of green and when -PRON- choose -PRON- could be very troglodyte 
the crew settle down to work with commendable earnestness of purpose and -PRON- have trouble with only one man 
-PRON- must be remember that -PRON- company consist of pick man 
-PRON- have some of the most skilled engineer mechanic and electrician that could have be find in britain or america and in addition -PRON- have other who make up for -PRON- lack of skill by willing spirit and remarkable adaptability 
the young man from about town both british and american where -PRON- could not do work in which -PRON- have be train take off -PRON- coat and work like laborer 
philip marqui of devonridge as an example would take -PRON- exgamekeeper one moggs off for a day hunting and would bring in enough fur and feather to keep the company feed well for day but next day would see -PRON- lordship on some rig work take order from sam smither as cheerfully as -PRON- have give -PRON- to moggs on the day previous 
moggs too would be find cook an appetizing meal for the chief to whom -PRON- speedily become devoted with the same amiable imperturbability as -PRON- have show in tramp through the marshland after devonridge 
moggs be a treasure for -PRON- be the only man among -PRON- who dare argue with the chief as to what be the proper time to eat and sleep 
in room of grumstock otherwise engage -PRON- make -PRON- an unofficial batman to -PRON- leader cook to the company in general and factotum at large about the cave 
another mighty hunter in -PRON- midst be billy hayne 
hayne have few word than any man among -PRON- not even except smither and -PRON- never be upset never ruffle 
the only time -PRON- ever see -PRON- show the slight symptom of be move be when lin greensleeve decry the merit of doublebarrelle english sporting gun in comparison with one of the pump variety from america a lot of dam rot greensleeve say billy with -PRON- wide stare 
talk about something -PRON- know frinstance the smelly stuff -PRON- work in and listen to -PRON- 
of lin greensleeve i have write something already 
-PRON- be good in the way that only an american can be 
full of the humorous exaggeration belove of -PRON- countryman -PRON- could string as -PRON- call -PRON- the briton among tis with superb ease and -PRON- have the knack of cause laughter but when -PRON- settle down to work -PRON- tear at -PRON- and hammer at -PRON- with a drive force that be a thing for wonder 
young lippencott too and steven curtis prove -PRON- value the former combine a drawled wit with a steady application to business and the latter with no less zeal in harness and -PRON- delightful gift of song always available for -PRON- amusement 
into the air i -PRON- cement that bind -PRON- together be devotion to the frail little man who inspire -PRON- 
-PRON- move in -PRON- midst with a gentle aloofness which do not repel 
-PRON- help -PRON- in -PRON- difficulty out of the deep store of knowledge in -PRON- amazing brain and -PRON- tend -PRON- in sickness or injury with the extreme skill though fortunately -PRON- ability be seldom call upon on the latter account 
in the hand of these willing comrade and under the direction of -PRON- brilliant leader the airship steadily grow into shape in -PRON- stock and at last the time come when the first ark of the covenant be ready to take the air and the second only wait the performance of the first to allow completion 
i think more than -PRON- experience a thrill of sort when that night the chief and -PRON- step into the recreation room of -PRON- company have come to tell -PRON- gentleman say the chief that tomorrow -PRON- fill the ship with gas and tomorrow night -PRON- take the air 
the cheer that go up may have be hear over the ande in ecuador -PRON- be new eve and a night of bright moonlight that pale the tropical galaxy of star 
the ark of the covenant float down the main cavern on -PRON- own power 
-PRON- have fix taut cable crosswise over the wall and roof of the cave so that -PRON- would rub against no rock surface 
for a moment -PRON- hang steady over the entrance basin then i nod to the chief who be by -PRON- side 
-PRON- gently pull round the ascent indicator as i bell for half speed and the ship rise smoothly by the head as -PRON- gather way 
-PRON- shoot up at a surprising speed and on the instant i know of a certainty that i be in command of the fine craft that ever sail on sea or in air 
-PRON- be a living thing obedient gentle strong 
-PRON- test -PRON- thoroughly against the wind and with -PRON- and -PRON- high speed be well over three hundred kilometre an hour balance be perfect 
-PRON- close all aperture and turn on the compress air which be also feed to the engine and -PRON- give -PRON- full gas 
-PRON- rise at dizzy speed so that i begin to have fear for -PRON- ballonet 
-PRON- touch a height close on nine thousand metre and the earth be lose to -PRON- 
high -PRON- go and -PRON- be certain that no know machine could reach -PRON- 
yet -PRON- find resistance enough for the propeller to cruise at a good speed 
-PRON- know that -PRON- be safe from all pursuit when -PRON- choose 
-PRON- come down again and test -PRON- for drift for -PRON- turn 
-PRON- drift little and with the help of the pivot stern cabin -PRON- could come about almost inside -PRON- own length 
the chief accept the wonderful performance of the ship with the great calm for i think -PRON- never have a doubt of -PRON- capacity 
what concern -PRON- more be the working of the various instrument -PRON- have invent for pur use 
first of these be the navigate globe 
this be nothing less than the earth in miniature 
for -PRON- control the chief have utilize not only the magnetic ray of the earth but also in some extraordinary way the pull of the earth as -PRON- revolve on -PRON- axis 
the ball which be the earth in replica thus be always poise in exactly the same relation to the ship as the earth -PRON- 
the globe swing on an elaborate system of gymbal and -PRON- core be take up by a series of magnet 
the whole of this complicated piece of mechanism be enclose in a gasfille chamber the top of which be pierce for a lens through which the illuminate portion of the globe directly under be throw magnify by a camera obscura on a vertical groundglass screen 
the groundglass screen be cross by two hair line -PRON- intersection give the position of the ship over the earth and the vertical hair -PRON- direction 
to test the instrument the chief bade -PRON- fix -PRON- own course for some place recognizable make -PRON- own reckoning and -PRON- cover the groundglass with a cloth 
i fix on caracas and put the ship in that direction at full speed 
on -PRON- mettle i take no chance 
i calculate drift and everything that may throw -PRON- out of -PRON- course and when -PRON- arrive over the city and pull the cloth from the indicator the cross hair stand clean on the dot represent the place 
-PRON- be on a plain of the hill behind caracas that i be first introduce to the directive ray which control the cloud of anaesthetize gas for here the chief have a glass bomb fill with the liquid gas and drop haphazard on the plain 
below -PRON- the gas widen into a luminous cloud 
the chief be work with a box affair which have a sort of lens arrangement on one side and be connect to the hightension circuit 
-PRON- and thetford manipulate this box through a hatch in the cabin floor 
as i watch i see the cloud take shape and move across the plain now one way now the other 
-PRON- be drift on the wind with stop engine but the cloud be make to travel in advance of -PRON- or across -PRON- path at the will of the chief 
as i watch i see the cloud move toward a series of dot cattle of some sort on the plain 
-PRON- envelop -PRON- and whatever -PRON- be horse or steer -PRON- be all lie on -PRON- side when -PRON- have pass 
-PRON- be enough say the chief 
have -PRON- kill -PRON- sir i ask 
and -PRON- look up at -PRON- very mildly 
why what a question -PRON- say and from -PRON- seton 
no no -PRON- friend -PRON- be only asleep 
as -PRON- speak -PRON- move the box back and forward quickly and below the gas cloud be break and begin to disperse 
that be well for one morning the chief say rise 
now seton let -PRON- be back at the plateau with the dawn 
in the west the moon be low down and darkness be spread over the land 
below -PRON- no light gleam nor often do -PRON- catch the faint sheen of water save only when -PRON- speed over the orinoco -PRON- 
darkness for a space but for the light of the star and then come that cold tinge of grey in the east 
quickly fade the grey into pale topaz and chrysoprase until as -PRON- slant down to the basin of -PRON- cave -PRON- be lose in the glory of the rise sun 
-PRON- trial trip be over with abundant success 
the deluge day after -PRON- initial voyage -PRON- almost lose the first ark of the as a total wreck and a little later -PRON- seem likely that both -PRON- ship would be damage beyond repair 
the second ship still lie in -PRON- stock wait for any improvement that may be suggest by the performance of -PRON- sister ship 
-PRON- have take out ark of the covenant i on continue test and -PRON- have be cruise some hour towards the early evening when without warning -PRON- be catch by a tropical storm at a considerable distance from -PRON- base 
for the storm in -PRON- -PRON- need to care little enough -PRON- would have be possible to ride over -PRON- 
but -PRON- find -PRON- in the air with only sufficient petrol for the home run 
-PRON- have moreover no store aboard to permit any comfort in wait for the storm to die down 
there be nothing for -PRON- but to run 
behind -PRON- the storm be rise on a following wind and -PRON- be a question of time if -PRON- could be at the cave entrance before the impact catch -PRON- 
the ship behave admirably roll little keep -PRON- balance and speed like a throw javelin for home 
-PRON- drop into the entrance basin under a sky black as ink 
over -PRON- the rise wind be moan precursor of swift hurricane 
if -PRON- could not get the ship into the cave the chance be that -PRON- would first be batter against the cliff then lift and throw perhaps into the south atlantic 
every single man jack ashore be on the guy rope and number of the crew have drop hardily into the water to help but the ship swing stubbornly towards the threatening angle of the entrance 
-PRON- have not the weight to pull -PRON- round and the edge of the hurricane be tear down on -PRON- 
from the cabin of the ship i be try to direct the operation of the man both aboard and ashore but the noise of the wind make hear difficult 
-PRON- come to -PRON- that if -PRON- do not act quickly time for action would be past so i spring for the deflation gear and spin round the handle 
in a second or two there be scarcely a foot of gas in the whole ship and -PRON- sink into the basin 
now i shove over the control to half speed 
deprive of -PRON- buoyancy the ship be easy to handle and as the man resist the drive of the wind -PRON- forge ahead into the cavern -PRON- propeller lash the water and -PRON- cabin awash 
-PRON- be in the nick of time for even as -PRON- rudder pass the jamb of the entrance the crest of the hurricane catch the ship and throw -PRON- stern against the fender rope 
but -PRON- be inside at the cost of strained rudder stay and one propellerblade break 
the great door be close against the storm which be now upon -PRON- with clamorous fury 
to restore a measure of buoyancy to the ship enough at least to take -PRON- out of the water be only a question of turn on -PRON- reserve gas 
and in a little ark of the covenant i be snugly secure by -PRON- mooring stay in -PRON- own hangar cave 
all this time the chief have not move from -PRON- position 
-PRON- have be cling by -PRON- single hand to a rail and i turn to -PRON- with an apology for souse -PRON- and -PRON- wonderful instrument 
but the only reply i receive be one of -PRON- extremely rare handshake and i know then that i have somehow please -PRON- 
-PRON- go together to the live quarter and when -PRON- have change i join -PRON- in -PRON- laboratory to watch the storm 
fortunately the window of the laboratory and of the livingroom be shelter from the force of the wind and -PRON- catch nothing but the eddy 
outside the land lie in half light but -PRON- be possible to see that the tree and shrub near -PRON- be bend low and lay flat by the terrific drive of the hurricane 
sometimes a great tree would give the earth below -PRON- would part and the root would come up majestically into the air with a cloud of broken soil 
at time one of these uprooted tree would be lift bodily and carry through the air like a feather 
bush be fling high and the air be fill with debris whiz along at lightning speed 
i think of the line from the deluge of to hear frae the pitmirk on hie 
the brangled collieshangie flee 
the warld ye thocht twixt land an itsel have coupit and for auld aim the smash debris by god be roupitl then come the rain a grey streak curtain of -PRON- thicken in texture till -PRON- be almost a solid mass of water obscure the view -PRON- base a teem mist of shatter drop 
thick and more dense -PRON- grow till the roar of -PRON- drown the voice of the wind 
suddenly the fall of the water -PRON- could not be call rain thin and a terrible spectacle come before -PRON- eye 
the water thin gather to a dense core and wreathe into a whirl spiral which spin up and up until -PRON- widen into an invert cone of leaden cloud behind which the lightning play in livid sheet and splash 
and the dense column of water move over the cup north of -PRON- plateau solemnly majestically roar the tune of -PRON- march as -PRON- go with undertone of the crash thunder 
-PRON- trail be a wide path of smash and riven tree and flatten shrub 
over the cup of land the column move leave a sheet of desolate water until -PRON- pass to the spur of hill of which the plateau be the point and be lose to -PRON- sight 
-PRON- voice now be mute to a distant murmur fret by jagged muttering of faroff thunder 
the drab greenish mauve of the sky lighten to a generous amber 
of -PRON- relief that -PRON- have find haven before such an awful visitation let a second silent handshake between the master and -PRON- bear witness 
yet -PRON- bad danger be still to come and -PRON- be to find that -PRON- have congratulate each other too soon 
the river of the northward cup be lose in a wide sheet of water and -PRON- be apparent that the outlet gorge be too small for quick drainage 
-PRON- see that the water of -PRON- entrance basin be rise steadily and quickly which mean that the level of the waterway within the cavern would be rise also 
this -PRON- find to be the case but towards nightfall the rise seem to have find -PRON- maximum 
-PRON- be cheat into a false sense of security 
the note of -PRON- cavern waterfall give -PRON- first warning of the danger 
in the year of -PRON- sojourn under the plateau of the scar the voice of the fall have ever be a friendly whisper to -PRON- 
-PRON- live with -PRON- solacing murmur always in -PRON- ear and i think -PRON- miss -PRON- when absent from the cave 
but in the middle of the night after the hurricane -PRON- become acutely conscious that -PRON- note be change grow louder gain a suggestion of menace 
desperate work -PRON- noise swell into a threatening roar and as i get up from -PRON- bed to dress the whole cavern be fill with a hoot and rumble which vibrate enough to shake the tooth from one head like pip from a squeeze orange 
-PRON- be plain now why the indian avoid the plateau of the scar 
the noise be terrify 
already most of the man be astir for the uproar make sleep impossible and when i get out of the dormitory into the main cavern and push home the inain switch the arc light up a sight that spell immediate danger 
the column of water from the fall be come down -PRON- passage at such force and volume that -PRON- be describe an arc above -PRON- normal ledge shoot clean past the turbine barrier right to the center of the cavern lake 
the level of the water in the cavern be creep up at an alarming speed and already the machineshop be flood the oilcave awash and most of -PRON- work floor be under water 
i muster all hand and -PRON- tumble into launch and barge or indeed into anything that would float 
-PRON- first concern be to throw open the big gate of the cave entrance lest -PRON- should impede the egress of the water but this give little relief 
to save -PRON- ship from be crush against the roof of -PRON- cave be -PRON- next thought 
-PRON- find the first ship so deeply awash that -PRON- be strain at -PRON- mooring stay 
-PRON- slacken these so that -PRON- rise until -PRON- top be almost scrape the ceiling but the water mount so quickly that -PRON- find this expedient useless 
i would have take -PRON- clean out of the cavern but the height of the entrance be perhaps the low point of all in the great chamber and wdth the high level of the rise water that way of escape be bar 
all -PRON- could do and a despairing measure -PRON- seem be to unmoor -PRON- and maneuver -PRON- to that point in the cave system where the ceiling be high 
i shall not dwell on the strenuousness of -PRON- labor but -PRON- may be imagine 
-PRON- be all soak to the skin and i be almost afraid to take tally of the man in case some of -PRON- should be miss for every now and then -PRON- have have to pause to rescue one or other who have wander into deep water 
i be afraid some poor chap have do so unnoticed 
-PRON- bring the first ship as i have say to the point where the cave be the high and here -PRON- moor -PRON- as good -PRON- could 
the danger for number two be now imminent 
-PRON- be complete except for -PRON- engine and as yet -PRON- be not buoy with gas 
when -PRON- go to look after -PRON- -PRON- find -PRON- as -PRON- sister have be half immerse in water with -PRON- stay hold -PRON- down 
the stay be cleat under water and several of the man be about drown in unhitch -PRON- 
-PRON- succeed in free -PRON- only to be face by another peril 
the roof of -PRON- cave come down in the middle to a sharp ridge and if -PRON- rise higher the danger be that -PRON- back would be break or at least buckle beyond repair for -PRON- have no rolling mill to straighten -PRON- girder 
-PRON- be out of the question again to pull -PRON- out to a high portion of the main cave since the neck of -PRON- hangar be -PRON- low point 
-PRON- be lin greensleeve who save -PRON- 
lin take a party of man with pick up to -PRON- observation top and on -PRON- upper deck -PRON- set -PRON- to hew down the sawlike ridge which be nothing else than a series of stalactite of vary depth depend from the line of some transverse crack in the ceiling 
-PRON- hew off as much as be humanly possible and just when lin as a last desperate resource be for put in one or two of -PRON- favorite shot the water suddenly stop rise 
-PRON- stand by -PRON- and examine the state of affair 
-PRON- find that number one still have a couple of metre to spare for clearance and that the two though -PRON- fabric be sadly knock about by the fall of rock from the ceiling be structurally intact 
but the rise of the water for another half a metre would buckle -PRON- past redemption 
lin still be eager to try a small shot or two at the stubborn point of the ridge but as the water seem to have find -PRON- level and have not rise for about forty minute the chief and i decide to risk the chance 
-PRON- muster -PRON- man and find all present 
-PRON- be sadly drench and dishevel but cheery in spite of chatter tooth and tired limb 
the excellent moggs have begin to cook early breakfast at the shout of and by the time -PRON- troop into the livingroom -PRON- have gallon of hot coffee and mountain of appetize food prepare 
-PRON- be spare further anxiety for the water remain at -PRON- last level for several hour though the waterfall still roar and throw -PRON- column into the middle of the lake 
when the sun have be up several hour the chief and i take a launch and begin to investigate the rise of the water and -PRON- ultimate holding of a maximum level 
to take the sudden rise first though -PRON- be the second point of -PRON- investigation this be due to two thing 
the waterfall be supply from that lake on the high step above the plateau 
normally the lake be fill from underground spring and at -PRON- usual level feed -PRON- waterfall through a submerged outlet 
but with the sudden rise of the lake level owe to the torrential rain and the cloudburst -PRON- water begin to pour over -PRON- lip into a crack which lead to a second passage run underground to join up with the normal conduit to the fall 
second the lake water find another outlet over the side of the hill and into a course usually dry which bring -PRON- into the cup of land north of the low step of the plateau 
this with other stream pour into the cup bring the water speedily up to a high level for the little canon of -PRON- stream to the innominata be not capable of let the abnormal influx escape at any speed 
thus the water of the cup and of -PRON- underground lake have only two mean of egress through the gorge and through the small entrance to -PRON- cavern 
when the water reach a certain height however -PRON- find two extra outlet 
one -PRON- discover be in the cave -PRON- a minor cave on the west side which at -PRON- extreme end shelve down to a deep subterranean chasm 
the second be a break in the lip of the north cup over which the water pour into the marshland beyond 
-PRON- now have learn -PRON- lesson and would know what to do in the event of another storm in the future 
when the water subside as -PRON- do in the course of the day -PRON- put number one back in -PRON- hangar and bring the two into the middle of the main cave 
lin greensleeve have put a few of -PRON- small shot into the ridge of the ceiling and with long lead -PRON- explode -PRON- to -PRON- and -PRON- entire satisfaction 
one point remain 
-PRON- fowl and duck who have the high cave in the low series escape with nothing bad than a bad fright 
-PRON- find -PRON- huddle at the extreme end of -PRON- habitation and moggs declare the muster complete with the exception of one duck probably more adventurous than -PRON- fellow who -PRON- be surmise have be sweep away by the torrent out of the small entrance the first raid have repair the damage cause by wind and water to the ark of the covetiant and that inflict on number two by -PRON- sousing and the fall of rock upon -PRON- 
into number one -PRON- have instal the last of the instrument invent by the master for the demonstration of -PRON- discovery 
none but -PRON- and thetford be permit to toucli certain of these instrument for -PRON- embody a devastating power 
two machine alone so far be to be handle by member of the crew that control the anaesthetize gas and another design to ward off airplane attack 
the night before -PRON- first essay the master join -PRON- in the common room and share -PRON- meal 
-PRON- speak to -PRON- earnestly of the high emprise on which -PRON- be about to embark 
never have i see -PRON- frail leader so impressive nor ever do -PRON- tremendous personality so shine from -PRON- 
-PRON- speak as be -PRON- will not in a clear calm voice unemotional with no attempt at drama 
-PRON- be always the reverse of dramatic consciously and by the very negation make -PRON- the nub of drama the most poignant and tell 
-PRON- simply ask the man to be faithful to use the power -PRON- may have to put in -PRON- hand with care for human life and never to let -PRON- stray for a single moment from the strict sense of duty 
finally -PRON- ask -PRON- to trust -PRON- and -PRON- trust -PRON- 
chief all right some of -PRON- say sure -PRON- will gentleman say the master 
-PRON- have show -PRON- that i can trust -PRON- implicitly 
-PRON- have do well and faithfully in the first phase of -PRON- work 
no man could have do well 
see to -PRON- that -PRON- finish -PRON- course with equal faith equal good service 
if -PRON- serve -PRON- cause and each other with wholehearte zeal -PRON- can not fail man be aboard ark of the covenant when -PRON- set out in the middle day for the city of new york 
-PRON- climb high out of sight practically and with the heater and compress air at work make -PRON- way in direct line for -PRON- destination 
-PRON- journey be uneventful and only the steady creep of the map on the navigate globe mark -PRON- progress 
with the dark -PRON- drop to fifteen hundred metre and breathe fresh air 
-PRON- be over new jersey after midnight 
-PRON- lower -PRON- gondola with -PRON- crew to a low height and from there -PRON- drop -PRON- gasbomb on a petrol station 
the airship then come down until -PRON- be almost nestle on the top of the shed 
from the airship -PRON- let down tube and work in gasmask -PRON- rob the tank of -PRON- spirit 
the whole operation take less than half an hour 
thence -PRON- proceed to the business quarter 
-PRON- drop bomb at the end of a long thoroughfare and one in the centre 
again the ship be bring close to the earth this time so that -PRON- lie along the street 
the gondola rest on the car line 
to break into the food store be an easy task require no more than a stout jimmy and -PRON- man begin to hand out the store as devonridge and i select -PRON- 
this occupy an hour and -PRON- come away after leave money roughly calculate to pay for the good 
-PRON- be now close on three 
-PRON- mount high and cross the river until -PRON- lay over wall street the gondola be lower from a great height and telephone communication from -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- direction 
-PRON- strew bomb all about the district twelve altogether so that the gas cloud wreathe the street visibly to -PRON- though invisible to anyone on the ground 
-PRON- then come down as indeed the finn klenski see close to the roof of the national metallurgical 
two party of seven man each squad with a flamecutter of the invention attack the bank 
each party also have a stout little trundle cart rubbertire to collect the gold 
one group tackle the national metallurgical and the guaranty while the other attend to the dyer and the trade 
the first party have finish load the gold from -PRON- two bank into the gondola and have begin operation on the subtreasury before the other party have complete -PRON- work on the dyer and the trade 
when the second haul of gold and security have be stow the party combine force on the treasury 
-PRON- appear to waste no time but owe i suppose to inexperience an hour and twenty minute have pass before -PRON- last haul be aboard the ship 
meantime accord to prearrange plan envelope address in disguise hand be ready for the security and the little lead box of radium all prepare 
-PRON- be -PRON- task to drop these into the box at the post office 
i walk out of the gas area by back street and be fortunate enough to escape observation for when i come round by the park above the post office i see a thickish crowd further down broadway apparently try to find out what be happen at the low end 
street car stand one behind the other in a procession for the chief have throw a ray over the area to upset all electric circuit to avoid accident from the traffic 
the vicinity of the post office however be bare of people and i drop -PRON- package into the box unnotic 
i return by the same roundabout route only stop to put -PRON- gasmask on when i know i be approach the danger area 
the only person i see previous to that be a policeman who be innocently rap and try door 
-PRON- heart go a little faster as i pass -PRON- but -PRON- garb be not unlike that of an officer of the american air police and -PRON- salute -PRON- wish -PRON- goodnight 
-PRON- could not have know that just round the corner of the street be a stop motortruck over the dashboard of which two man sprawl unconscious 
altogether -PRON- be a scary business and i determine in -PRON- own mind that on the next raid there would be no go out of the affected area 
-PRON- be too risky for i could not imagine what i should have do if the police have completely surround the district 
i enter the gondola and be pull up with the rest of the gang as i may dub -PRON- league and within two hour of -PRON- arrival above wall street i be steer the ship high above new york as -PRON- make out to sea 
all next day -PRON- lie poise over the atlantic at a great height and -PRON- sleep in watch 
towards night -PRON- begin tq cruise about for -PRON- have pick up paper from the bank which give -PRON- information of the parnassic 
-PRON- see the oiltanker westbury early and mark -PRON- course for further use 
-PRON- see the parnassic long before -PRON- attack -PRON- 
indeed -PRON- follow -PRON- easily for an hour before -PRON- shoot ahead to lower the red riding lamp which stop -PRON- 
-PRON- have drop -PRON- gas in readiness in -PRON- path and when -PRON- hove to -PRON- manceuvre -PRON- about -PRON- 
-PRON- then swoop down alongside and lay the gondola close by 
-PRON- piracy occupy forty minute 
-PRON- be pitiful to see the ship so helpless and the sight affect the mariner among -PRON- very strangely but there be no ice in the sea near by or the chief certainly would have take measure to restore some of the ship company to consciousness before leave 
-PRON- now speed after the westbury 
the only thing remarkable about this raid be the extraordinary truculence by wireless phone of -PRON- yankee skipper 
-PRON- seem to bear little love for the navy of -PRON- country and one would have think that a warning to heave to be the big insult -PRON- have ever have in -PRON- life 
but that rasp voice be soon still by -PRON- gas and -PRON- have little difficulty in help -PRON- to the skipper excellent aviation spirit 
these raid accomplish -PRON- circle wide out to the atlantic and be snug down in the cavern by early the next day 
further success -PRON- news -PRON- have of the effect of -PRON- raid be meagre for -PRON- pick up very little through -PRON- wireless but that -PRON- have create a deep impression -PRON- feel sure 
a fortnight after the new york raid -PRON- descend on louisville and there besides make off with gold and foodstuff and petrol -PRON- rob the newspaper file in one of the bank a point that have escape notice 
from these journal -PRON- gain an idea of the turmoil and consternation -PRON- raid have cause 
among other thing -PRON- notice be the fact that the business chaos -PRON- intend to bring about by take the security have be lessen by -PRON- speedy return to the proper quarter and since the idea be to disturb business as much as possible as a preliminary to -PRON- further plan -PRON- decide that there should -PRON- no such mistake make in future raid 
-PRON- be only because this point have not yet occur to -PRON- that -PRON- hold to -PRON- first procedure in deal with the louisville bond 
-PRON- have not of course then read the newspaper 
the gold which -PRON- ld collect up to this time -PRON- melt and recast into ingot of -PRON- own design 
the gold be of no value to -PRON- in view of certain power within the hand of -PRON- leader 
-PRON- next raid be to test the stay power of the irk of the covenant to the full 
-PRON- know from chance message pick up that the air police of america be active in -PRON- lookout but of the disposition in england and europe -PRON- know nothing 
the long flight to london be make without mishap and here in the banl of england and elsewhere -PRON- create as much trouble for business quarter as -PRON- could 
to drop bomb all about the house of parliament and nestle on the terrace be the easy thing -PRON- have ever do for the district round about be little frequented at the moment 
-PRON- do not even have to take any precaution against trafiic run amuck 
this raid be a demonstration of power pure and simple and -PRON- leaving of the radium beside the mace be definitely do so that -PRON- should be quite realize that -PRON- be -PRON- who have put the common to sleep 
-PRON- helper in this exploit be lord devonridge and as -PRON- have be tell of the idea beforehand -PRON- be prepare 
-PRON- be -PRON- who blacken the face of the member of the front bench in revenge -PRON- say for the heavy taxation of -PRON- class which have drive -PRON- from the country and as a reprisal for the docking of the privilege of the lord 
when i turn to find -PRON- thus busy with -PRON- prepared cork -PRON- first feeling be one of surprised annoyance but there be something so ludicrously unexpected in the businesslike sangfroid with which -PRON- set about the task that continue anger be impossible 
i imagine to be candid that the absurd spectacle afford -PRON- in one particularly offensive politician from whose obtuseness i have frequently suffer while in the air service have a great deal to do with -PRON- complacence over the scheme 
to see the pompous fathead with -PRON- face blacken be complete solace for all the irritation i have experience formerly through -PRON- fatuous ignorance 
the chief however take another view 
-PRON- consider that -PRON- mission have be degrade and -PRON- give devonridge a wigging which while -PRON- hold no trace of anger do not lack in point 
but even the chief be not proof against the gay insouciant humor of devonridge and in the end i think -PRON- forgive the culprit fully 
at any rate the joy of the english member of the crew be worth any little lowering of tone -PRON- suffer by the exploit 
the raid on the house of common occupy little more time than -PRON- take to write of -PRON- and after operation on the army and navy store -PRON- drop down the river to purfleet where -PRON- replenish -PRON- depleted store of petrol 
once again -PRON- take to the high -PRON- could compass and -PRON- drift slowly west to be in readiness for -PRON- descent on berlin 
the berlin raid be accomplish without mishap but -PRON- be at paris that -PRON- be make fully aware of the preparation against -PRON- 
-PRON- be comfortably settle on the top of the building in rue bailliff and the burglary party be inside the banque when -PRON- hear the drone of airplane 
fortunately thetford be on the ship observation top in readiness for such an emergency and in spite of the machinegun fire the little fellow pluckily manipulate the ray for upset the electric circuit of the plane engine 
-PRON- come out of the scrap without scathe and have the satisfaction of see both -PRON- opponent go down out of control 
-PRON- hasten the depositing of the gold which be design for create further confusion in the mind of those after -PRON- and leave -PRON- usual quantity of radium before speedily take to the air again 
from paris at a great height -PRON- bear due south until -PRON- be over the pyrenee where -PRON- swing souwesterly in arch line for the plateau 
-PRON- be now apparent to -PRON- that -PRON- have put a very effective speak in the wheel of the world business and have stir europe and america into a state of apprehension and mystify anger 
-PRON- be plain too that drastic measure would be take to run -PRON- to earth now that -PRON- be definitely know the raid be accomplish by airship 
-PRON- determine to demonstrate -PRON- power by daylight and give those who chase -PRON- every chance to meet -PRON- if -PRON- could 
-PRON- raid on europe take place on a weekend in april and -PRON- next raid which be by daylight on shipping along the south african route from england take place on the first sunday in may -PRON- know from the wireless message which -PRON- pick up that many airplane be after -PRON- and later when -PRON- have skip back to the plateau message emanate from one particular plane the merlin show that -PRON- be be pursue by the fast air machine ever know 
-PRON- take the trouble of record the message from this merlin and -PRON- begin to note that not only could -PRON- get about from place to place in incredible time but -PRON- seem capable of extremely prolong flight 
the follow weekend find -PRON- raid shipping on the north atlantic while the merlin -PRON- know be scour the canary 
news of -PRON- north atlantic raid which -PRON- take the trouble to relay by wireless -PRON- bring the merlin to the azore but by the time -PRON- most assiduous pursuer be sweep the atlantic for -PRON- -PRON- be fly out of sight above -PRON- on -PRON- way home 
-PRON- now rest for another week and in the late evening of the middle saturday of may set out for further raid on the african shipping 
-PRON- reach madeira in the early hour of sunday morning and find a temporary mooring place on the paul da serra that barren piece of desolation to the west of the island 
there -PRON- lay snug until the first peep of day when -PRON- unhitch to fly northward to intercept a unioncastle liner 
this time -PRON- be unaware that the ubiquitous merlin be close behind -PRON- 
a little spying have drop -PRON- gas cloud and have sweep the ship with -PRON- 
-PRON- have grapple -PRON- gondola to -PRON- side 
-PRON- be a raid of terror merely but -PRON- break into the strongroom as a matter of course 
-PRON- find little not enough to justify abstraction but -PRON- be help -PRON- to the ship store of food when the message come from aloft ware plane to recall the crew be a matter of second and -PRON- have the gondola into the ship and have cast off before the silver plane dive at -PRON- 
eastward now -PRON- see the approach of the british planecarrye enuser 
there be something divinely beautiful in the swift brave swoop of that lovely silver shape 
-PRON- come down at dizzying speed so that -PRON- be useless to try -PRON- ray upon -PRON- for -PRON- have the force of gravity to bring -PRON- 
but -PRON- open the gasjet about the ship make a cloud of anaesthetic envelop -PRON- 
-PRON- seem with the steady rise of the ship that the plane be bind to miss -PRON- but -PRON- be sadly mistaken 
the pilot know -PRON- business 
before -PRON- realize what have happen -PRON- have flatten in a fashion which would have shatter the average plane into -PRON- component part and -PRON- be openly fire upon with accurate burst of shellfire both fore and aft of the plane as -PRON- whiz under -PRON- 
the ark of the covenant stagger a little but answer readily when -PRON- give -PRON- more gas 
-PRON- rise steadily and now -PRON- foe have to climb 
-PRON- see that the merlin for so -PRON- suppose -PRON- attacker to be from -PRON- speed and -PRON- fine design be somehow immune from -PRON- gas cloud 
-PRON- swing after -PRON- into the cloud but get a burst of shellfire none the less 
-PRON- find -PRON- could not take -PRON- at -PRON- present angle and -PRON- spin quickly about 
-PRON- pilot be one in a hundred for knack fire from -PRON- quarter and another burst of shell from astern 
-PRON- could not afford to experiment any further and -PRON- put -PRON- ray on -PRON- 
-PRON- slide back on -PRON- tail immediately only to flip over into a wellcontrolled and peculiar hovering descent 
to make sure of -PRON- -PRON- sweep a gas cloud about -PRON- as -PRON- lie on the sea 
by this time -PRON- have to turn -PRON- attention to the cruiser which be come up on -PRON- position in great style 
-PRON- see a plane catapult after -PRON- and presently the cruiser open fire with -PRON- heavy antiaircraft gun 
then come a second plane 
the remainder of the encounter be as have be previously describe down to the message which pass between -PRON- and the brilliant 
-PRON- could have clear beyond range at any time after deal with the merlin and -PRON- only reason for prolong the business be to see that the pilot be pick up 
-PRON- do not want any of -PRON- to be drown after an extremely plucky fight 
-PRON- be for this reason that -PRON- sweep the gas from about the merlin and tell -PRON- -PRON- engine be all right 
when -PRON- see that all be well -PRON- give the airship -PRON- full lift of gas and make eastward out of sight where -PRON- turn south for a space before swinge westward and home to examine -PRON- hurt 
the damage do to -PRON- by the gun be not important and -PRON- consider -PRON- value at the measure -PRON- have take of the plane capacity against -PRON- 
-PRON- have rake the dining quarter of the crew wreck -PRON- almost and have pierce several of -PRON- ballonet but have miss everything vital 
there be no casualty to speak of save that billy hayne take a machinegun bullet in the leg a mere graze which do not even make -PRON- limp 
but unimportant though the damage to ark of the covenant i be -PRON- be enough to put -PRON- out of action for a space and necessitate the commissioning of -PRON- sister ship 
the ark be fully equip and have be try 
-PRON- be in a state of complete preparation to take to the air 
the swiftness of -PRON- flight which be far beyond the speed of any know dirigible and the fact that -PRON- have two ship do much to create the impression among -PRON- pursuer that -PRON- have a number of basis 
-PRON- hasten to complete that impression sixty hour after -PRON- encounter with the merlin by a descent on the other side of the atlantic 
here -PRON- raid several ship in the caribbean early on the follow wednesday morning 
-PRON- know from message that -PRON- most avid hunter still be look for -PRON- off the coast of africa 
early next morning traver lippencott in an automobile pick -PRON- up in the country outside new orlean 
-PRON- have be inform of -PRON- need by a mysterious and incomprehensible wireless message from -PRON- kindly exhibit as a great find by all the newspaper 
i be convey into new orlean and after a long consultation with lippencott on the situation i go to new york first then to washington 
-PRON- purpose in this action be not so much to spy out what preparation be be make for -PRON- reception in the event of further land raid though i leajrne a good deal about this incidentally as to discover how ripe the time be for further development of -PRON- idea 
-PRON- be easy to see that jople be in a state of nervous tension no town know when the mysterious enemy would come down upon -PRON- 
-PRON- robbery in europe and america have induce panic in banking circle and a wave of deep depression be sweep over business 
for -PRON- i be almost appal by the chaos that reign in the market for i well know the regular price of the good american security and these be sell at ridiculous figure 
so far -PRON- be plain -PRON- plan have succeed beyond -PRON- wildest hope and the time be ripen for the enlargement of -PRON- campaign 
the rumor of war which have be rife in the early part of the year have fade away the nation be too busy suspect each other of be behind the raid 
the position of a spy be never agreeable and i can not say that i enjoy meet old friend who insist that as a know airman i should take a hand in the pursuit of the raider 
-PRON- be not pleasant again to hear man bewail the condition of affair in business -PRON- have build up by the honest work of year 
i feel as if i have stab -PRON- in tho back and each new grip of the hand from friend who be suffer only deepen a conviction in -PRON- of villainy 
-PRON- would hardly bome -PRON- to examine -PRON- feeling further since i carry on with -PRON- task 
fortunately for -PRON- investigation i be well know in america and to reach the president -PRON- be a matter of no great difficulty 
the presence in washington of lord almeric pluscarden make thing easy because i have often stay with -PRON- and -PRON- niece kirsteen torrance at -PRON- country house in kent 
-PRON- relationship to lord almeric have be one mainly of business but -PRON- be good enough to desire -PRON- friendship as well and -PRON- and miss torrance and i have become close friend in the few year i have know -PRON- 
-PRON- be something of a shock then to find miss torrance and lord almeric in a degree slightly less emphatic so deeply set on the discovery and defeat of the league of which i be rather an important member 
i find -PRON- in a position of secret personal antagonism to friend for whom i care a good deal 
-PRON- be ever on the tip of -PRON- tongue to start defend -PRON- motive for act which -PRON- condemn without know -PRON- for the perpetrator 
i should have escape earlier from except that i have a lively curiosity to see this jimmy boon of whom both kirsteen and -PRON- uncle talk with such warmth and i think i see affection 
the name be familiar to -PRON- as one of a man who have do some remarkable thing in the development of aviation and indeed i see -PRON- name every time i examine the exhaust of -PRON- airship engine for -PRON- be -PRON- double silencer which permit the stealthy approach for which -PRON- be so notorious 
that jam boon pilot the merlin which have put up such a good fight against -PRON- airship be an additional factor in keep -PRON- fix to -PRON- uncomfortable position in i be hope that the merlin would return when -PRON- be find that haunt the coast off mogador be without profit 
but for that i should have go to new orlean and wait there for the time when the ark of the covenant be to pick -PRON- up again on a date already fix 
the merlin arrive on the last day of may and i meet -PRON- principal antagonist at the white house as have be tell 
then i learn much which interest -PRON- and would interest the chief 
there be no doubt that boon and -PRON- scientific friend lament though i must not forget the redoubtable milliken be a remarkable combination 
-PRON- be not at all unlikely that in the long run -PRON- should meet again and -PRON- be quite probable that -PRON- tenacity would bring -PRON- into close range of the hidingplace of the league 
a wish come true washington on friday follow -PRON- first meeting with boon and -PRON- friend and -PRON- hint that -PRON- should ask the raider why -PRON- raid be drop by intention 
the ark of the covenant pick -PRON- up on the saturday night and on the sunday night -PRON- be out over the sea due east of washington wait for some vessel through which -PRON- could answer the wireless message to the president 
that -PRON- fix on the pershing be the mere accident 
-PRON- be the handy for -PRON- purpose that be all 
-PRON- find the boarding of the battleship decidedly difficult for the reason that -PRON- still steam after -PRON- have bring the gas about -PRON- the member of -PRON- crew on the upper work become unconscious but the gas apparently do not percolate into the engineroom 
-PRON- have to keep pace with -PRON- and carefully let the gondola light on -PRON- afterdeck 
take small bomb of the gas with -PRON- -PRON- go forward and get down to the engineroom where -PRON- sling -PRON- missile 
then one of -PRON- engineer bring the ship to and some of the seaman release -PRON- anchor tackle 
-PRON- leave the message in the wireless cabin and immediately set off for washington 
-PRON- be over the capital when the message be relay there and -PRON- pick -PRON- up while -PRON- be hover high above the city 
that be the moment -PRON- be wait for 
a little time be allow for the delivery of the message to the president before -PRON- swoop down on the white house bombing as -PRON- come 
a few minute later the gas have be carefully draw away from the mansion the master and i walk into the room where the president lie unconscious with boon lamont and miss torrance with -PRON- 
the little chief look very stern and grave as -PRON- gaze on the scene and -PRON- be -PRON- who put the cushion under the head and cover -PRON- 
-PRON- leave the note in answer on the table 
find something to cover the girl seton -PRON- say 
-PRON- be thinly clothe fly coat will do for miss torrance sir i say and with a very queer feeling although i know -PRON- be unharmed i put the coat about -PRON- 
i turn to find the master look at -PRON- strangely 
who do -PRON- say the girl be -PRON- ask 
miss torrance sir 
the niece 
then -PRON- must be relate to that david torrance who be something of a physicist twentyodd year ago -PRON- daughter sir know david torrance well and -PRON- wife the chief say slowly do not know -PRON- have a daughter -PRON- walk over to the sleep girl and say with a little pity gesture of -PRON- one hand poor child -PRON- can never have know -PRON- father -PRON- turn -PRON- mild gaze on -PRON- and -PRON- hold nothing of the slight emotion or pity that have seem to lie in -PRON- voice 
come seton -PRON- say quietly 
this night -PRON- and i have light such a candle pray that benjamin whitcomb have courage worthy -PRON- great responsibility -PRON- go out by the window close -PRON- behind -PRON- 
for the next week -PRON- do not move from the plateau except twice by night to pick up wireless message 
the effect of -PRON- answer to the president be difficult to gauge from what -PRON- pick up but certainly -PRON- method of make the reply be bandy about in wonderment from coast to coast 
that there be no likelihood of an armistice be declare -PRON- know from the speedy pursuit of -PRON- by boon and company who be patrol within for the merlin two hour flight from -PRON- lair 
whether -PRON- have come upon such a hot scent of -PRON- by accident or not -PRON- do not know for certainly -PRON- have do everything that vary speed of flight and vary direction could compass to confuse pursuit 
the point that interest the chief about the crew of the merlin be the presence of lamont who -PRON- declare on the evidence of several of paper on physics have one of the keen brain in america should like to meet mr lamont the master say to -PRON- in -PRON- gentle way almost wish -PRON- have kidnap -PRON- at washington -PRON- dear seton 
and if mr boon show sign of come any closer to -PRON- hidingplace i may begin to regret -PRON- do not capture -PRON- also 
lamont in one of -PRON- paper make a surprising mistake for -PRON- in an otherwise interesting speculation on the variation of electron 
i think i may make -PRON- error clear to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have boon and -PRON- down on -PRON- at any minute sir i laugh 
-PRON- may kidnap -PRON- then 
within a fortnight -PRON- jesting suggestion come to earnest reality 
a severe storm break over -PRON- on the following week and -PRON- last off and on for six day with extraordinary electrical disturbance in the atmosphere 
-PRON- slack then until on the saturday night in the third week of june -PRON- begin a series of raid on shipping on both side of panama 
on the sunday morning -PRON- know that boon be hot after -PRON- -PRON- be always terribly frank with -PRON- wireless message but -PRON- go out again on the sunday evening and stop a ship between the galapago and the mainland 
-PRON- be return over guayaquil and fly quite low when -PRON- see the merlin lie in the roadstead of the harbor a tiny little shape of dull silver against the blue of the water 
i be certain that -PRON- see -PRON- before -PRON- crew see -PRON- and as soon as i catch sight of -PRON- i alter -PRON- course to a good number of point southerly but i do not alter speed until the harbor have disappear behind the mountain 
when that happen i alter the course to -PRON- real direction and put more power into the engine of the ship than -PRON- have ever have before 
-PRON- leap to -PRON- as no airmachine ever speed save the merlin -PRON- 
-PRON- do not make for height the time for that be not yet 
-PRON- simply speed as though the devil -PRON- be at -PRON- tail 
a sharp lookout be keep astern from every possible point of sight but -PRON- soon become evident that the merlin either could not take the air or have fail to see -PRON- 
i think the latter reason for -PRON- nonpursuit most unlikely and have two idea in -PRON- head 
if the merlin come into view before -PRON- could get to -PRON- cavern i intend to overshoot the mark climb high and send -PRON- down by mean of the ray 
clever as the plane be -PRON- could not get above -PRON- and under -PRON- -PRON- be completely at -PRON- mercy without the slight chance of retaliation 
but i do not want to send -PRON- down in a place where -PRON- crew would be unable to escape 
by sheer good luck -PRON- be able to be snug in the cavern with the great door shut before -PRON- see the merlin come wing up in a wide circle from the southeast a fact that make -PRON- realize again -PRON- magnificent turn of speed since -PRON- have be able to follow the false trail and make loop in search 
i have take a party of man arm with winchester to the top of the plateau to watch for with the basin and the amount of water around -PRON- there be distinct temptation for a seaplane to alight 
like some graceful great bird the plane swoop down on the plateau and hide among the tree -PRON- see -PRON- zoom over the edge of the bluff east of the red scar 
i station -PRON- man among the shrub west of the scar in case boon would take -PRON- into -PRON- head to come down on the upper lake and begin to investigate 
and so -PRON- fall out 
-PRON- wait a considerable time then -PRON- see lamont and boon descend the bluff 
-PRON- be ready for any eventuality 
-PRON- come out of the bush and approach the red scar which seem to interest -PRON- greatly especially lamont 
-PRON- then work round -PRON- to the north and disappear among the shrub and tree in the direction of the cliff over the basin 
i send several man to cut off -PRON- retreat to the merlin 
but the visitor do not immediately go back to -PRON- plane 
-PRON- bear down the west side of the outcrop towards the sinter cone and -PRON- be behind these that i have -PRON- man dispose close to the descend passage to the cave 
when -PRON- have fully assure -PRON- that -PRON- suspicion be wellfounde -PRON- hold -PRON- up 
-PRON- be blindfold and lead down the underground passage while i take -PRON- man up to the lake to see what could be do for the remain visitor to -PRON- conclude have prevail upon a number of -PRON- oustande author to write for some new science fiction story 
these story be now available through -PRON- new library entitle science fiction series six book have be prepare with the follow title by david keller by jack williamson and mile breuer by michelmore by lilith lorraine by leslie stone by morrison colladay these book be available at the small price of 10c each 
for further information turn to page yek bring -PRON- toe together complete the electric circuit and a tiny vortex ring of gas shoot out 
in a moment the arrogant female bully crumple to the floor like a deflated toy balloon do -PRON- think of the crime that be commit by the purple woman last night yek put this question to -PRON- wife kaza as together with -PRON- son ralus -PRON- sit eat breakfast in -PRON- mountain home just north of burbank california 
-PRON- certainly be get more daring and more ruthless every day kaza reply 
accord to the account i receive through the hypnoscope while i sleep last night -PRON- vibrate over a score of man and woman with no apparent reason 
the newsitor compare -PRON- to weasel that slay not out of necessity but merely for the joy of kill 
-PRON- certainly be frightful the way crime be get the upper hand nowadays suppose that s the penalty -PRON- have to pay for recent development in science and invention yek rejoin 
but one would expect that as mankind develop in knowledge crime would be wipe out or at least diminish materially instead of increase at such a terrible rate as -PRON- have during the last few year reasonable enough to expect an improvement in moral development to accompany scientific advancement but history show the opposite to be true 
-PRON- father tell -PRON- that in the early day when -PRON- grandfather be judge fully fifty per cent of the crime that come to -PRON- attention could be trace to automobile which at that time be be widely use by criminal 
at this ralus ever on the alert for word -PRON- do not understand pipe up with daddy what s an automobile 
surely -PRON- must know what an automobile be -PRON- father come back at -PRON- -PRON- study about automobile in -PRON- history yet 
not yet 
-PRON- mustnot forget daddy that be go to school for only three year and i just start in high school a month ago well then i suppose have to tell -PRON- 
the term automobile be apply to a very primitive kind of conveyance which be use seventy year ago 
-PRON- be a cumbersome device with four wheel and an excessively heavy motor 
-PRON- burn a liquid call gasoline and crawl along the ground at the snaillike pace of from twenty to fifty mile an hour 
there be a few specially make automobile that succeed in attain a speed of about two hundred mile an hour but -PRON- be too costly and too unsafe to be practical 
but daddy i think -PRON- tell -PRON- once that when -PRON- be a boy -PRON- use to travel in airplane correct 
the automobile pass out long before -PRON- time be a story by the wellknown sciencefiction author that -PRON- can warmly recommend to -PRON- attention 
the author certainly open up an entirely new vista before -PRON- eye yet -PRON- be careful never to exaggerate scientific and particularly aviation possibility 
while a few of the instrumentality which -PRON- describe may never become apply commercially yet there be nothing wrong with -PRON- scientifically 
-PRON- be certain that all of the thing of which the author speak so convinceingly could some time in the future be use just as -PRON- picture -PRON- to -PRON- 
-PRON- be certain that the story will arouse yotrr enthusiasm 
and i believe i also tell -PRON- that the airplane be an extremely crude contraption 
-PRON- be so limited in -PRON- scope that -PRON- be practically worthless without the automobile to supplement -PRON- 
all -PRON- knowledge of the automobile be from -PRON- father 
-PRON- see the airplane be considerably heavy than air and -PRON- have no gravinul to diminish or eliminate the attraction of gravitation 
-PRON- couldnot rise abruptly from the ground as -PRON- spacemobile do 
the only way -PRON- could get into the air be by make a long run along the surface 
-PRON- also need lot of room in landing since -PRON- could not be bring to a stop instantly 
all these thing make -PRON- necessary for the airplane to depend on enormous specially construct field call airport 
some of -PRON- be more than a mile long 
naturally -PRON- be impossible to provide such huge open field in the congested section of a metropolis and the airport be usually situate at some distance away from the city -PRON- serve 
both passenger and freight have to be carry along the surface for anywhere from five to fifteen mile and this be usually do either by automobile or by socalled motor truck which work on the same general principle 
sometimes as for instance in travel from the center of san francisco to the center of los angele a passenger would have to waste more time get to and from the airport than -PRON- would spend in the air 
ralus learn something hat must have be a blink system the boy remark 
ralus dear -PRON- mother interpose 
how many time have i tell -PRON- not to say blink or any other slang expression for that matter 
excuse -PRON- mother 
i mean to say that -PRON- must have be egregiously inefficient and excerebrose better glad to observe that -PRON- be at last beginning to acquire something more than a schoolboy vocabulary 
and now to resume -PRON- discussion ralus continue 
-PRON- say daddy that the airplane didnot have any gravinul 
i think the gravinul be invent way back in -PRON- be probably think about the discovery of the scientific principle on which the gravinul be base 
i think -PRON- be in that a man name einstein give the first scientific explanation of the relation between gravitation and magnetism 
the gravinul be invent about twenty year later by a man name jone charle jone 
but daddy that couldnot be 
charle be the name of the man who first fly from new york to paris 
-PRON- mean lindbergh 
yes -PRON- name be charle too 
in those day there be hundred of people in the world have the same name 
that must have be awfully confusing 
-PRON- be 
when -PRON- father be a boy there be over two hundred man name john smith list in the los angele city directory 
and i guess there be pretty nearly as many name william jone 
how could anyone tell -PRON- apart 
at this point in the conversation kaza interrupt ralus dear -PRON- realize -PRON- be monopolize -PRON- father attention 
i also have a few matter i should like to discuss with -PRON- 
oh excuse -PRON- mother 
i didnot mean to be discourteous 
but there be so many thing to learn nowadays 
this prompt yek to reprove -PRON- wife mildly -PRON- think -PRON- dear that -PRON- ought to encourage ralus to ask question instead of discourage -PRON- 
-PRON- be over a hundred year ago that a great philosopher say the unquestioning mind be an unthinking mind and surely -PRON- donot want ralus to stop think do -PRON- 
certainly not -PRON- dear 
i havenot the slight objection to -PRON- answer -PRON- question except that -PRON- be almost time for -PRON- to leave and i have something to tell -PRON- 
what be -PRON- honey 
nothing serious i hope 
no nothing serious just that i have grief with -PRON- spacemobile yesterday afternoon 
the external lubricator go caducous and i have to leave -PRON- at reno 
the blink mechanic there tell -PRON- -PRON- couldnot have -PRON- ready until noon today 
ralus begin to giggle 
what be -PRON- laugh at -PRON- mother demand 
because -PRON- would hardly get through scorch -PRON- for use slang when -PRON- say caducous and blink in the same paragraph 
at this yek laugh heartily 
there be some case where the use of slang be justified 
at any rate -PRON- well than profanity eh -PRON- dear 
the bad of -PRON- be kaza resume have to make a trip over zion canyon to get material for a booklet i be to prepare right away 
the tourist season hasnot open yet and the spacebus service there be terrible know what that mean yek respond 
-PRON- want to borrow -PRON- spacemobile 
no argument about -PRON- 
help -PRON- 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- can spare -PRON- today 
easily 
i expect to be work all day in -PRON- san francisco laboratory have time to catch the eightfourteen spacebus and that will get -PRON- into frisco before nine 
thank -PRON- so much dear 
that certainly be sweet of -PRON- 
-PRON- be quite welcome afraid -PRON- have let -PRON- coffee get cold 
just a moment and have televox bring -PRON- a fresh cup 
-PRON- whistle a short musical strain and in a few second the door from the kitchen open and the grotesque metal body of the televox enter and set a steaming cup of coffee on the table 
kaza whistle another little ditty and the mechanical servant glide back into the kitchen again 
ralus take advantage of this intermission to pick up -PRON- broken thread of questioning 
mother dear do -PRON- mind if i ask daddy another question 
ask as many as -PRON- please -PRON- son have -PRON- little say 
this name business be what s puzzle -PRON- daddy 
-PRON- doesnot seem reasonable for even two different person to have the same name not to mention two hundred person -PRON- register name in those day not until the year -PRON- present system of naming be first suggest by a woman name dex a member of the same profession -PRON- mother now follow 
-PRON- mean -PRON- be an advertising counsellor 
yes 
and the interesting thing about -PRON- all be that -PRON- merely apply to human being the simple common sense rule which have for year be use in name pin peanut pant prune and other branded article 
the law now require that a name shall be give to every child and this name must fulfill all these requirement -PRON- must be an arbitrary combination of letter that have no meaning and that be different from the name of any person now live -PRON- must be easy to spell pronounce and remember 
if the child be a girl -PRON- name must begin with one of the first thirteen letter in the alphabet 
a boy name must with a letter between and parent be allow ten day from the date of birth to select a name to -PRON- liking 
naturally -PRON- have access to the register at washington in check for duplication 
in case the parent neglect to do this a name be arbitrarily assign by the naming bureau 
there be a lot of other interesting detail about the system as for instance the meth of know whether a person be married or single and also the occupation but -PRON- get late so have to tell -PRON- the rest some other time 
domestic difficulty hen yek turn to -PRON- wife 
-PRON- havenot forget about that trust deed that fall due tomorrow noon have -PRON- dear 
-PRON- remember donot -PRON- that -PRON- tell -PRON- not to worry about -PRON- and that -PRON- would take care of -PRON- 
good zenith 
so i do 
at the time i tell -PRON- that i feel sure the volim company would pay -PRON- that twentyeight hundred -PRON- owe -PRON- but -PRON- have be stave -PRON- off and -PRON- look now as if have to sue -PRON- to make -PRON- pay 
but donot -PRON- realize that -PRON- must have the money in hand not later than tomorrow noon 
-PRON- know how -PRON- be 
when -PRON- give -PRON- notice that -PRON- wouldnot rpew the trust deed i have the feeling that -PRON- be try to get -PRON- home away from -PRON- know -PRON- but i couldnot help -PRON- could at least -PRON- could have tell -PRON- before so i could try to get someone else to take over the trust deed just like a woman to leave everything to the last minute 
and -PRON- just like a man to blame -PRON- wife for something that couldnot be help 
-PRON- be then that ralus break into the conversation 
now please mother and daddy donot get to quarrel again 
first thing -PRON- know -PRON- will be get a divorce and then where will i be 
cheesity but i wish -PRON- could get over these everlasting financial difficulty 
seem as if the only time -PRON- two start talk mean to each other be when -PRON- get to argue over money matter 
-PRON- just wait until old enough to work 
-PRON- can bet do -PRON- share so -PRON- wonot have to fight over money any more guess the boy be right kaza yek say as -PRON- reach over and pat -PRON- son hand 
-PRON- have enough to worry about without try to make thing unpleasant for each other sorry i speak harshly 
when i get to frisco go in and have a talk with wupiz the capitalist 
i think i can persuade -PRON- to loan -PRON- the money so i can get the trust deed out of hand hope so dear awfully sorry i disappoint -PRON- 
-PRON- be very thoughtless of -PRON- not to tell -PRON- about -PRON- failure to collect that money as i have expect to 
oh that s all right honey 
-PRON- all overlook thing once in a while 
and take care of -PRON- some way phone for an appointment with wupiz while ride on the spacebus 
-PRON- must be on the lookout for the purple woman yek dear -PRON- wife admonish -PRON- 
-PRON- wasnot so long ago that -PRON- rob the pacific space express forget that -PRON- be deprave and think nothing of take life 
if -PRON- happen to get into a robbery be sure to do just what -PRON- tell -PRON- to wonot -PRON- 
if -PRON- try rob the bus while on -PRON- -PRON- be go to get the surprise of -PRON- life yek assure -PRON- 
what do -PRON- mean work out a little contrivance yesterday and just wait for a chance to try -PRON- out 
with -PRON- i can shoot out vortex ring of hypnogen 
as -PRON- know this gas be perfectly harmless but the tiny whiff of -PRON- will put a person to sleep for several hour 
the orifice for discharge the gas be in one of the button on -PRON- coat 
i can aim -PRON- simply by move -PRON- head 
when i want to discharge -PRON- all i have to do be bring -PRON- toe together 
this join two expose wire in the tip of -PRON- boot make an electrical contact which cause a ring of gas to shoot out in exactly the same direction i happen to be look at that time 
well i hope -PRON- work all right 
but whatever -PRON- do for heaven sake be careful wonot -PRON- dear worry honey 
when do -PRON- expect to leave have to get go right away 
then see -PRON- off 
kaza whistle for televox to remove the breakfast dish 
then the three of -PRON- prepare to don -PRON- fly coat 
these garment be make of a tough waterproof fabric that resemble leather but be much light and more flexible 
between each sleeve and the side of the coat be a triangular membrane which remind one of the wing of a bat 
when the arm of the wearer be extend horizontally these membrane be stretch tight and form a pair of serviceable wing 
the coat bulge slightly between the shoulder to allow room for the gravinul a small box about four inch square and threequarter of an inch thick 
this be control by small cylinder hold in either hand and connect to the gravinul with wire run along the sleeve 
ralus be just about to put on -PRON- fly coat when -PRON- mother call to -PRON- ralus come here 
let -PRON- look at -PRON- ear 
just as i think 
-PRON- march right in and give those ear a good scrub young man 
the idea of eat -PRON- breakfast with a dirty face 
-PRON- face isnot dirty mother 
i wash -PRON- good in front 
-PRON- mean -PRON- wash -PRON- well in front 
but -PRON- know very well that -PRON- have to wash -PRON- on the side too and donot forget the back of -PRON- neck 
all right mother and ralus disappear into the bathroom 
into the air this time kaza and yek be draw on -PRON- fly boot which fit snugly about -PRON- calf and reach almost to -PRON- knee 
these boot have unusually long and pointed toe and the space between the top of the foot and the front of the shin be fill with another triangular piece of membrane very similar in character to the wing on the coat 
-PRON- be quite apparent that the purwse of these boot be to provide a sort of tail and stabilizer 
both kaza and yek wore breech not unlike those use by american soldier during the last war 
a headgear with goggle attach complete the outfit 
when -PRON- be thus attire -PRON- be hard to tell which be the man and which the woman 
accord to the standard of an early day -PRON- may have bn consider illforme 
-PRON- arm especially seem overdeveloped and be so long that -PRON- hand reach below -PRON- knee 
when -PRON- walk -PRON- toe point straight outward at right angle to the direction in which -PRON- be go 
to one who be familiar with the mode of life which this couple be live -PRON- be both beautiful specimen of humanity 
-PRON- certainly carry -PRON- with an air of confidence and of alertness that be both physical and mental 
when -PRON- be ready to leave -PRON- walk to the only exit to this doorless stairless house which be a traoor lead to the roof 
yek touch a button and the trap door swing open 
then kaza give a little spring and float swiftly and gracefully through the opening follow closely by -PRON- husband 
seem to be a lot of traffic this morning yek remark as -PRON- direct -PRON- gaze skyward imagine many of those people be go to santa monica to see the finish of the winging derby that start from shanghai the day before yesterday -PRON- wife suggest 
the air be indeed crowd with spacemobile and individual winger 
while a large percentage of -PRON- be head westward there be thousand of other dart at terrific speed in other direction 
an observer who be not familiar with the regulation govern -PRON- seemingly aimless flight may have wonder how -PRON- could possibly avoid collide with each other in midair 
-PRON- will be recall however that a carefully plan system of air traffic regulation have be evolve as a result of many serious accident which have occur at an early time when flying be so limited in scope that no special law regulate flight have be deem necessary 
there be eight zone level for air traffic each foot deep and separate by turn zone foot deep 
the northbound zone extend from to foot 
then come the north to northeast turn zone between the and foot level 
the northeastbound section include the space between foot high and foot with the turn one run from foot to foot altitude and so on 
all turn have to be make to the right or in clockwise rotation 
overtaking be invariably do on the left side and the law require at least fifty foot of clearance between pass flyer 
when these rule be carefully obey there be practically no possibility of collision occur but every once in a while some reckless or irresponsible pilot would disregard an important rule and would cause a serious accident 
besides the spacemobile there be the spacebuse which vary greatly in size and carry from to passenger each 
-PRON- invariably follow definite airlane which be mark by air buoy anchor to the ground with luminous steel cable at interval one mile apart 
each of these buoy be provide with a landing platform for take on passenger 
one of the mooring cable could be see about yard from the place where kaza be now prepare to take to the air in spacemobile 
well stop at a zip service landing and get a refill of press air yek tell kaza as -PRON- step into the machine which be park in the double hangar on the roof of -PRON- home 
the spacemobile be about fifteen foot long and five foot high 
in -PRON- general conformation -PRON- resemble the hull of an old fashioned submarine boat 
there be no wheel propeller rudder elevator or large protuberance of any kind 
in look at -PRON- an aeronautical engineer would instantly have notice that the shape of the device be marvelously well design to offer the least possible resistance to the air through which -PRON- travel 
the driver compartment be just behind the nose of the flyer the remainder of the room be devote to seat for four additional passenger space for storage and for the operating equipment 
clear vision in all direction be secure by construct the entire front end of the spacemobile of some transparent but extremely strong and flexible material and by an ingenious combination of prism and mirror that enable the driver to see everything behind above and below without turn the head 
the gravinul explain aza enter the machine through a small door which follow exactly the conformation of the body and could be close hermetically 
-PRON- do something to the control and instantly the spacemobile rise gently from the floor of the hangar and drift gracefully out into the open 
kaza blow a kiss to -PRON- husband 
there be a hiss of escape air and the spacemobile shoot upward 
within a few second -PRON- have bome a mere speck in the distance 
yek be just about to poise -PRON- for a flight when -PRON- hear ralus call -PRON- just a minute daddy 
please wait for -PRON- like to wing up to the landing stage with -PRON- if -PRON- will let -PRON- 
all right sonny boy 
since head north well only go to the first landing and -PRON- wonot have to cross any traffic zone so i guess -PRON- can come along this time 
whereupon ralus who be now garb in -PRON- flying outfit suddenly stretch -PRON- arm out at right angle to -PRON- side give a little leap and dart swiftly up into the air see -PRON- catch -PRON- daddy -PRON- shout over -PRON- shoulder 
then -PRON- begin the most astonishing series of maneuver in the air 
-PRON- roll and somersault and loop and soar 
no bird that fly be ever as graceful and as agile as ralus be 
-PRON- seem more at home in the air than on the ground 
-PRON- father soon catch up with -PRON- and playfully grasp -PRON- by the nape of the neck 
come on -PRON- cry no time for monkey business 
the bus be almost due now 
within a few second -PRON- have reach the foot landing and have seat -PRON- on the bench provide there 
tell -PRON- sonny boy say yek why do -PRON- ask to come with -PRON- this morning 
be -PRON- because -PRON- enjoy -PRON- daddys company 
in a way yes 
i always enjoy be with -PRON- of course daddy dear 
but to be perfectly honest with -PRON- the main reason why i come with -PRON- be that i want to ask -PRON- some more question 
so that s what s in the air be -PRON- 
i think as much 
well -PRON- would well fire away because there isnot go to be much time for elucidation unless the pacific space express be late and -PRON- know that doesnot happen very often 
the first question i want to ask be about the spacemobile 
-PRON- remember yesterday -PRON- promise to explain to -PRON- how -PRON- work very simple -PRON- boy 
the thing that keep -PRON- up in the air be the gravinul practically the same as the one in -PRON- fly coat except that -PRON- much large and more powerful 
-PRON- know how the gravinul work donot -PRON- donot believe i do except that -PRON- nullify gravity not exactly correct 
-PRON- doesnot nullify gravity although the name may naturally give -PRON- that impression 
all -PRON- do be to surround -PRON- with a field of energy through which the attractive force of gravitation have difficulty in penetrate 
the strength of this field can be vary by increase the power in the gravinul 
when -PRON- be wing -PRON- regulate this by the amount of pressure -PRON- apply to -PRON- grip 
in the spacemobile -PRON- be control by a small lever operate with the left foot 
and what make the spacemobile move ahead so fast 
that too be simple 
-PRON- depend on the same principle as the sky rocket -PRON- shoot off last fourth of july 
when -PRON- study physics -PRON- will learn of this principle as the law of reaction which say that for every action there be an opposite and equal reaction 
this account for the recoil of a firearm the bouncing of a rubber ball and a number of other familiar phe nomena 
the drive force be nothing but air 
but -PRON- be air in a very compress form 
even before -PRON- time tist know how to make liquid air but -PRON- be only within the last five year that a method be discover for compress this liquid into a very small space 
an other improvement be make in the method of manu facture 
liquid air be formerly make by a process so expensive that -PRON- could not be use for practical purpose 
but press liquid air be now prepare in huge plant operate entirely by sunlight and be very cheap 
ten liter of -PRON- cost only thirtyfive cent and will drive a spacemobile at the rate of a thousand mile an hour or more for about four hour 
but daddy how be -PRON- that -PRON- werenot able to travel more than three hundred mile an hour with airplane that be work by propeller 
one reason be that these airplane offer a tremendous amount of resistance to the air as -PRON- travel through -PRON- 
an interesting thing to remember about this resistance be that -PRON- increase with the square of the velocity 
this mean that when -PRON- travel mile per hour the resistance be four time as great as when -PRON- be go mile an hour 
if -PRON- increase -PRON- speed to mile an hour the resistance be nine time as much as -PRON- be at mile per hour and so on 
unless something be do to cut down this resistance -PRON- doesnot take long before -PRON- reach a point where -PRON- require a terrific amount of power to increase the speed just a little bit 
the airplane designer make a little headway in improve the shape of the fuselage wing strut and other part expose to the air 
-PRON- find that an object with a cross section like an elongated ellipse of certain proportion would offer the minimum amount of resistance because -PRON- prevent the formation of air eddy and vacuum pocket 
-PRON- also take pain to keep all surface as smooth as possible 
-PRON- seem rather funny though that no one at that time think of the simple expedient of lubricate the outside of the airplane although -PRON- seem to understand a lot about lubricate the internal working part of the machine 
the spacemobile make use of an ingenious device for lubricate the entire outside surface of the conveyance 
this reduce the friction of the air against the side to such an extent that hello 
here come the spacebus i have to start -PRON- magnetizer go 
well fly along ralus boy 
and watch -PRON- winging 
there be a lot of spacemobile ascend this morning so keep that little head of your turn around like a wise old owl 
so long honey boy 
goodbye daddy 
see -PRON- tonight and ralus take off in a gracefully execute swan drive toward the ground 
a game of mathic rise and poise -PRON- with arm outstretche as the huge flyer shoot toward -PRON- 
-PRON- slow down gradually and then yek wing up to a landing platform in the bottom 
yek find -PRON- have barely enough money to pay -PRON- fare 
there be plenty of room in the huge flyer and all sort of convenience be provide for the comfort and entertainment of the passenger 
at each seat be a pair of earphone and a device resemble a small opera glass 
yek strap on both the earphone and the binocular and with -PRON- help -PRON- hear the late news and at the same time see several important event while -PRON- be actually happen 
-PRON- be thus engage when sedix a resident of san diego pass near and recognize -PRON- 
come on yek old man sedix greet -PRON- look for a fourth to make up a game of mathic 
never mind the news nothing of consequence happen now 
come on and join -PRON- 
yek need no urge 
-PRON- accompany -PRON- friend to the game room near the forward end of the bus 
yek need no introduction to the other two person 
-PRON- name prominently display on the breast of -PRON- flying coat be dineli ron archi and tonida ron dineli stu 
this tell yek -PRON- sex marital relation and occupation as well as -PRON- individual name 
the large of the two -PRON- know must be a woman since -PRON- name dineli begin with a letter in the first half of the alphabet 
the ron inform -PRON- that -PRON- be marry and that -PRON- husband name be ron 
archi be an abbrevation of architect -PRON- occupation 
tonida be of course a man name and the masculine name ron follow -PRON- signify that -PRON- be unmarried and that -PRON- father name be ron 
this be follow by the name of -PRON- mother dineli 
-PRON- occupation as indicate by stu be student 
in accordance with this system the name on coat be yek kaza chem -PRON- wife be label kaza yek adv and -PRON- son ralus yek kaza stu 
an unmarried woman would be designate by -PRON- individual name follow by -PRON- mother name and then by -PRON- father 
in address any individual the first name only be use the other be merely informative in purpose 
honorary title such as mister miss rrofessor colonel and doctor have long since be abolish 
as be the custom when two man meet for the first time yek say greeting tonida and be answer greeting yek 
-PRON- also bow to dineli but do not speak to -PRON- until -PRON- have exercise -PRON- woman prerogative and have signify -PRON- willingness to meet -PRON- by say greeting yek whereupon -PRON- respond with another bow and greeting dineli -PRON- sit down at a table shape like a fourleafed clover and sedix start shuffle a peculiar deck of card 
to a watcher who be not familiar with -PRON- the game of mathic would have seem excessively complicate 
-PRON- could be play only by those who be well verse in high mathematic 
-PRON- be essentially a contest of brain and the winner have to demonstrate -PRON- superior alertness of mind and -PRON- accuracy in work out complex problem in differential calculus mentally and with amazing rapidity 
not far from -PRON- be two very old man gaze fixedly at a dilapidated chess board 
can -PRON- imagine those old fogy dineli remark play such a babys game as chess 
i happen to know the wife of one of those fellow and -PRON- actually be so puerile that -PRON- still play bridge 
-PRON- pick up -PRON- card and begin to play 
hope sedix doesnot start bore -PRON- with more yarn about that new baby of -PRON- yek think as -PRON- concentrate -PRON- attention on -PRON- hand 
but -PRON- have hardly register that suggestion on -PRON- inner consciousness before sedix start -PRON- know that baby daughter of mine sure pull a chunky one on -PRON- yesterday 
as usual -PRON- wife and i go to -PRON- office and leave the baby in the care of the televox 
of course -PRON- wife get a connection every hour and whistle for a report 
at eleven oclock televox signal back that the baby be lose 
-PRON- wife tell televox to look in a dozen different place but each time the message come back baby miss 
then wife begin to get alarmed 
call -PRON- all excite and say -PRON- be sure the rurple woman have steal -PRON- offspring 
make -PRON- quit work and dash home clear from fresno 
the wife duck home too of course 
for some time -PRON- couldnot locate the little eel until i happen to go into -PRON- bedroom and i hear a funny peep come from under -PRON- bed 
i look and there the little blatherskite be 
-PRON- have climb out of -PRON- crib and have crawl through three room and have hide under -PRON- bed cry a bit just peep and coo like a cute little bird 
now what do -PRON- think of that for a girl only five month old very remarkable say yek icily but sedix be completely oblivious of the sarcasm and continue to recite story after story of -PRON- only child prowesse most of which yek have hear at least a dozen time before 
-PRON- finish the first game which be win by tonida 
sedix compliment -PRON- with the remark -PRON- play an unusually tonic game for a man as young as -PRON- be 
specialize in mathematic i suppose yes sedix work for -PRON- degree at stanford 
tonida always be precocious -PRON- mother proudly enthuse 
-PRON- even work out the formula for the hecantonicosiahedragon when -PRON- be only eleven 
talk about precocity yek interpose -PRON- should have hear the humptydumpty screamer -PRON- son ralus pull at breakfast this morning 
-PRON- mother rebuke -PRON- for call something a blink system and the little blatherskite come back at -PRON- with some yank about -PRON- mean to say -PRON- be regiously inefficient and excerebrose 
then a few minute after that -PRON- wife get excited about -PRON- spacemobile break down and -PRON- forget -PRON- and say excuse -PRON- yek sedix interrupt 
but have to drop off at fresno and be almost there 
wingey wing see -PRON- later and -PRON- rudely depart without wait to learn what wife have say when -PRON- forget -PRON- 
about the purple woman sedix declare -PRON- be go to drop off -PRON- didnot mean -PRON- literally 
when a passenger wish to leave the bus -PRON- signal for -PRON- to stop -PRON- descend to the landing platform and wing off to the station 
once in the open air -PRON- could regulate the speed of -PRON- drop by mean of -PRON- gravinul 
a skilled winger could easily soar directly to -PRON- destination and could set -PRON- down within a few second after -PRON- have leave the spacebus 
the departure of sedix break up the game so the remain trio rise to leave the game room 
as -PRON- be about to pass into the main body of the bus yek notice for the first time a man and a woman each of whom be carry a small compact machine gun 
this be enough to proclaim -PRON- vocation even without -PRON- police uniform 
since the law against sell weapon of any kind to civilian have be so rigidly enforce that -PRON- be unheard of for anyone but a soldier or officer of the law to be see carry a firearm suppose -PRON- be hire by the bus company for protection against the purple woman yek remark to dineli 
can -PRON- imagine anything more ridiculous than those two officer hope to stop the purple woman with those antiquate machine gun 
-PRON- may as well use pea shooter about what -PRON- amount to dineli agree 
funny isnot -PRON- that the police donot seem able to keep pace with the crook always be that way 
as far back as the day when man ride horse the bandit usually have the fast mount and the most efficient weapon 
and -PRON- be the same story in the day of the automobile 
why even that machine gun the police be use now be invent way back in by a crook 
and the police didnot adopt -PRON- until the criminal have discard -PRON- in favor of a more efficient weapon 
then come the organization of the purple woman with -PRON- vibrator 
after six year of terror the authority havenot the faint idea of how these vibrator work 
all -PRON- know be that with one of these compact little weapon a crook can either torture paralyze or completely annihilate any number of human being at will 
against -PRON- -PRON- police force be helpless 
do -PRON- say police force ask tonida think a well name would be police by this time -PRON- have find seat in the main body of the bus 
dineli and tonida adjust -PRON- ear phone and teleview but yek find -PRON- diversion by look out of the window 
-PRON- attention be arrest by a spacemobile which be fly close to the spacebus 
-PRON- appearance be so peculiar that -PRON- be conspicuous even among the thousand of other similar conveyance which crowd the air 
while -PRON- general conformation be quite similar to that of the standard type of spacemobile there be something odd about -PRON- which yek be not able to pick out at first 
then -PRON- notice that the space in the rear where the rocket tube protrude be outlandishly shape 
even more surprising than that be the gas shoot out from these tube which be actually visible and be greenish in color 
the machine be close enough so that yek could count the occupant 
there be three of -PRON- 
the side door open and two of the passenger climb out on the roof of the flyer 
-PRON- be quite apparent that -PRON- be prepare to board the bus 
while the transfer of passenger from a spacemobile to a spacebus in midair be sometimes resort to in an emergency -PRON- be unusual enough to arouse special interest 
a radio signal be transfer between the two car to slow -PRON- down to the same low speed 
yek therefore watch closely as each of the stranger poise -PRON- and fly onto the landing platform 
the holdup rise and move closer to the entrance open in order to scrutinize the new arrival at close quarter 
thus yek happen to be stand in the aisle when -PRON- come toward the spacebus 
-PRON- look first at -PRON- left breast but instead of the name to indicate -PRON- sex marital condition and occupation -PRON- see nothing but two unsightly blot of purple 
-PRON- be a hideous color that give the same unpleasant sensation to the eye that a ld stench do to the nostril 
yek also notice that -PRON- not only wear the conventional helmet and goggle but the low part of -PRON- face be cover 
involuntarily yek gasp out loud the purple woman and at the same instant each of the intruder whip from under -PRON- coat a peculiar cupshape weapon 
in unison the woman yelp reach high everyone yek along with other passenger lose no time in obey this command 
in the excitement -PRON- forget all about -PRON- carefully plan scheme for outwit the criminal 
-PRON- be stand in the aisle a few foot away from the two purple woman who stand with -PRON- back against the rear wall of the bus 
turn around one of -PRON- yell 
face the other way 
yek in complying be force to stand in such a position that -PRON- gas project device be useless 
one of the purple woman remain in the rear of the bus where -PRON- could keep close watch on -PRON- occupant and -PRON- accomplice go methodically from one person to another demand money and valuable 
yek be one of the first to be rob and -PRON- give up -PRON- watch without a murmur 
-PRON- reflect that -PRON- be fortunate in have only a small sum of money with -PRON- but soon discover that this be a serious misfortune instead 
the rage of the purple woman when -PRON- learn that yek have only a few dollar to contribute be frightful 
-PRON- curse -PRON- with foul obscene oath and level -PRON- cupshape weapon at -PRON- 
there be a low whirring sound and immediately yek experience a most excruciating pain 
-PRON- begin to tremble violently from a mysterious vibration which shake every bone muscle and tissue in -PRON- body produce a horrible agonizing sensation 
there snarl the purple woman just a tiny dose 
next time -PRON- catch -PRON- travel with so little money -PRON- will get a lot more so take care and -PRON- move on to the next victim 
-PRON- be at this point that the two member of the police force become aware of what be happen 
-PRON- be gloriously courageous those two defender of law and order especially the woman 
without a moment hesitation -PRON- level -PRON- machine gun and send a stream of hot bullet point blank at the near purple woman 
the hail of steel jacket slug spatter against the crook garment and mask like raindrop on a tin roof 
-PRON- seem to have no effect whatever except to make the purple woman more angry 
-PRON- point -PRON- vibrator at the policewoman and -PRON- emit a highpitched screech noise 
apparently -PRON- be use a great deal more power than -PRON- have when -PRON- torture yek 
the body of the officer shake like a disturbed bit of jelly and within a second or two have completely disintegrate until not even a speck of dust remain of what be once a splendidly build human being 
even in the face of this unspeakable evidence of the purple invulnerable power the male officer still have the valor to raise -PRON- machine gun 
-PRON- didnot have time to pull the trigger however before the trembling death be upon -PRON- 
this time the murderess elect to maim rather than kill and the vibrator strike a middle note in -PRON- ominous song 
the policeman drop to the floor completely paralyze except for -PRON- eye which roll horribly in -PRON- socket and seem to beg mutely for death 
like a hungry wolf amid a flock of helpless sheep the purple woman spin around and snap out do anyone else want a dose 
one more false move and vibrate the whole bunch of -PRON- to hell as -PRON- turn to cover the entire bus with -PRON- alert eye -PRON- face come directly in range with the button on coat which be connect with -PRON- asphyxiate apparatus 
quickly but cautiously yek bring -PRON- toe together 
this complete an electric circuit and a tiny vortex ring of gas shoot out 
-PRON- be almost colorless and to anyone but a train chemist who be watch for -PRON- the ring be invisible 
yek notice with disappointment that -PRON- go wide of -PRON- mark 
but -PRON- shift -PRON- head in the direction which -PRON- think would correct the aim and again bring -PRON- toe together 
this time -PRON- score a bullseye and the arrogant female bully crumple like a deflated toy balloon 
the other purple woman be behind yek and -PRON- dare not turn to attack -PRON- know that -PRON- would vibrate -PRON- at the first false move 
but when -PRON- see -PRON- companion in distress -PRON- hasten to assist -PRON- 
as -PRON- stride along the aisle -PRON- have to brush yek out of the way and at that instant a desperate ruse pop into -PRON- head 
-PRON- happen to be stand directly over one of the trapdoor 
as the purple woman rush past -PRON- -PRON- grasp -PRON- belt and at the same instant turn -PRON- magnetizer full power into reverse 
with a sudden jolt yek and the purple woman be hurl through the opening 
-PRON- be a risky thing for yek to do but -PRON- depend on take advantage of the suddenness of -PRON- surprise strategem 
battle in the air i succeed far better than -PRON- have hope 
in the excitement the purple woman let go of -PRON- vibrator keen eye see -PRON- as -PRON- fall and -PRON- also notice that -PRON- be drop faster than the two hunan body which because of -PRON- fly suit offer more resistance to the air 
yek release -PRON- hold on the purple woman and with all the force -PRON- could muster wing straight downward in pursuit of the rapidly descend vibrator 
when -PRON- sense -PRON- purpose -PRON- antagonist join the chase 
as -PRON- drop at a terrific speed yek ever intent on know what be go on all around -PRON- follow the advice -PRON- have give that morning to -PRON- son and keep -PRON- head turn around almost like an owl 
-PRON- notice with some alarm that the purple spacemobile have alter -PRON- course and be descend rapidly evidently with the idea of aid antagonist 
the purple woman be a powerful winger and -PRON- have nearly overtaken yek when -PRON- catch up with the vibrator and snatch -PRON- out of the air 
by this time -PRON- be within less than a hundred foot of the ground and descend at such a terrific speed that -PRON- be in danger of be dash to piece 
just in time -PRON- spread -PRON- wing and manipulate -PRON- foot fin in such a way that -PRON- shoot skyward again in a graceful zoom 
then -PRON- soar swiftly downward landing as gently as a feather 
a hundred foot away from -PRON- the purple woman be also in the act of alight 
immediately -PRON- dash toward yek in a series of awkward leap 
yek point the vibrator at -PRON- and press everything -PRON- could find on the contraption 
after what seem an eternity -PRON- hear the shrill buzz and the whole atmosphere around -PRON- begin to quiver 
the purple woman cease -PRON- leap but do not seem to be at all bother by the vibration 
instead -PRON- be fiendishly amuse 
when -PRON- be about fifteen foot away from -PRON- -PRON- halt and begin to laugh 
-PRON- be the most malevolent laugh that yek have ever hear 
-PRON- be the sort of laugh that be commonly ascribe to -PRON- satanic majesty when -PRON- gloat over the unfortunate soul who be be torment in purgatory 
-PRON- be then that the dreadful truth flash over yek 
the purple woman wear an armor that protect -PRON- not only from bullet but also from the effect of -PRON- own diabolical weapon 
but yek have learn that -PRON- be vulnerable in one place 
-PRON- have to breathe 
as -PRON- stand there mock -PRON- with -PRON- wicked laughter yek take careful aim with -PRON- asphyxiation apparatus and bring -PRON- toe together 
the laughter die as if -PRON- throat have be cut and the purple woman seem to melt like a jelly fish when -PRON- be throw on the sunlit sand 
that leave but one more menace for yek to face the woman in the strange spacemobile 
-PRON- have delay alight apparently at loss to understand what have happen to -PRON- companion 
but now -PRON- be quite clear that -PRON- be come straight for yek who realize that -PRON- would be catch at a great disadvantage since -PRON- know -PRON- would start to vibrate -PRON- long before -PRON- could hope to catch -PRON- within range of -PRON- asphyxiator 
-PRON- be just on the point of set -PRON- flyer down a short distance away frcwn yek when the air be rent by the earpierce shriek of a siren 
jubilantly yek understand what that mean 
-PRON- be the police distress signal 
a hero in -PRON- own home a lmost instantly the call be answer from six different direction and as if by magic a number of police flyer loom up seemingly from nowhere 
this distract the attention of the remain purple woman and save yek from the ordeal of a oneside encounter with -PRON- 
with insolent disregard for the police flyer the bandit guide -PRON- car right through -PRON- very midst 
bullet rattle harmlessly against the side of -PRON- spacemobile 
-PRON- play with the police officer fly around -PRON- slow spacemobile which be capable of make only mile an hour 
then when -PRON- have have enough of this horseplay -PRON- shoot out a dense cloud of dark green smoke through -PRON- rocket tube and fairly melt out of sight 
one of the policeman spy yek and set -PRON- spacemobile down in the field in which -PRON- be stand 
-PRON- prove to be zamot a captain of detective 
when yek point to the motionless body of the purple woman the officer express -PRON- astonishment and admiration sure do something yek old man -PRON- cry 
this be the first time in six year that one of the purple woman have be capture alive also capture a vibrator yek declare proudly go to take -PRON- to -PRON- laboratory and see if i canot discover the principle so well be able to find some way to protect -PRON- against -PRON- 
fine work the officer compliment -PRON- 
if -PRON- want -PRON- to take charge of -PRON- prisoner and see that -PRON- be lock up 
by all mean yek agree 
-PRON- will be insensible for about two hour but after that -PRON- would better watch out and see that -PRON- be carefully guard 
-PRON- know these purple woman be bad actor and -PRON- be famous for -PRON- cleverness and resourcefulness worry clip -PRON- wing for -PRON- so shell never vibrate anyone again 
and by the way zamot -PRON- may also arrange to have the other purple woman take off the spacebus 
the other one do -PRON- mean to tell -PRON- -PRON- catch a brace of -PRON- -PRON- ought to be on the police force no thank yek smile as -PRON- think of factious reference to the police farce 
now that the excitement be all over yek suddenly become conscious of the fact that -PRON- be painfully upset 
every now and then -PRON- body would start tremble due no doubt to the after effect of the vibrating -PRON- have receive at the hand of the female bandit 
-PRON- be about to wing up to a landing and catch a spacebus for home when a familiar spacemobile loom up above -PRON- 
a moment later -PRON- have alight and -PRON- wife rush to -PRON- and gather -PRON- into -PRON- strong arm 
yek 
-PRON- darling -PRON- cry 
how -PRON- frighten -PRON- 
-PRON- be splendid yek dear but oh i wish -PRON- would not be so reckless 
then -PRON- see -PRON- all 
most of -PRON- 
a smart reporter get the story almost the instant -PRON- happen and put -PRON- on the radionew 
as soon as i learn -PRON- be the bus -PRON- have take i turn around and fly toward -PRON- keep the bus in focus on -PRON- teleview all the time 
i catch the tail of -PRON- fall race with the purple woman and the fight -PRON- have with -PRON- on the ground 
but -PRON- must be pretty well shake up -PRON- think -PRON- would better come home now dear guess well yek murmur and -PRON- collapse so that -PRON- wife have to drag -PRON- into the spacemobile 
when -PRON- arrive home kaza insist on put yek to bed though -PRON- protest that all -PRON- need be a half hour rest to make -PRON- fit again 
-PRON- run along kaza dear -PRON- tell -PRON- be all right 
-PRON- mustnot neglect -PRON- work on -PRON- account too late to make that zion canyon trip now and there s nothing else that s particularly press so i may as well stay home for the rest of the day and take care of -PRON- 
-PRON- direct televox to prepare a light meal and after yek have rest for a while -PRON- sit up and eat -PRON- luncheon 
the home be save after three oclock ralus arrive and be astonish and delighted to find both of -PRON- parent home 
explanation follow and yek have to spend the rest of the afternoon answer innumerable question which -PRON- son ask -PRON- about every conceivable phase of -PRON- exciting adventure 
-PRON- be not until -PRON- be eat -PRON- evening meal that the subject of the trust deed now almost due again come up for discussion 
this time kaza think of -PRON- first 
what about the trust deed -PRON- suddenly cry 
-PRON- didnot have an opportunity to do anything about -PRON- of course 
great zenith no -PRON- husband exclaim 
this robbery business certainly ruin the day for -PRON- afraid that mean well have to give up -PRON- little home 
one more thing to blame on the purple woman -PRON- do something tomorrow morning donot see how that would be possible 
wupiz never show up at -PRON- office on saturday and -PRON- would only make -PRON- angry if i try to talk business with -PRON- at the country club the only one i know that have any capital to invest right now and -PRON- rather late to dig up someone else 
just then a mysterious voice seem to come from nowhere say be yek there

editor park place new york city 
i have check on the coupon below the story i like good in this issue and have list -PRON- in the order of -PRON- preference w remark and suggestion name address city state i cut through tlie upper wing and then as i tear back i cut -PRON- completely off 
the great plane staggerea as back away 
-PRON- pilot strove mightily to right -PRON- but the ship reel drunkenly to earth all come about through be laugh at 
one resent have -PRON- pet hobby ridicule 
why mr clare -PRON- idea relative to the airplane of the future be visionary and impractical 
-PRON- speak of obtain -PRON- gas from sea weed 
how absurd general morley at that time head of the aeronautical division of the united state army speak scornfully 
-PRON- look around at the other member of the board for -PRON- endorsement 
colonel brandon eye -PRON- coldly nod -PRON- approval 
demonstrate -PRON- gas challenge colonel brandon 
-PRON- seem to forget 
colonel brandon that through the influence of senator ballantree i recently give this board a chance to test -PRON- 
but the board refuse to comply with -PRON- condition to safeguard -PRON- secret 
now i will demonstrate -PRON- only in the plane 
however i grant -PRON- this much the gas be carry in a dry concentrated form 
here gentleman in this small cube i go on take the cube from -PRON- pocket and hold -PRON- aloft be enough material to make one thousand cubic foot of nonexplosive gas by the addition of a little water 
as i have state before -PRON- have only onefifth the weight of helium 
those be extravagant claim observe colonel brandon be prepared to prove -PRON- revolutionary as -PRON- be i say 
but i lack fund 
uncle sam can not play santa claus all the time smile the general 
at present -PRON- be take a rest 
besides there be many failure in the airplane game -PRON- know remark colonel brandon 
-PRON- be right i agpeed with asperity 
but all the failure can not be lay at the inventor door or on the machine -PRON- 
the general frown and colonel brandon glare 
show -PRON- a work model demand funeral morley 
demonstrate -PRON- right to speak on this momentous subject 
-PRON- record overseas during the late war and -PRON- work as an air mail pilot give -PRON- that right 
general i answer a little proudly 
as to -PRON- theory i have demonstrate -PRON- to -PRON- own satisfaction 
when i build another plane -PRON- will be large enough to carry -PRON- into the air 
-PRON- scout -PRON- ability to construct a workable plane differ radically from those -PRON- have always know 
-PRON- be afraid to get out of the rut 
-PRON- be blind to the war cloud shadow -PRON- horizon 
i desire to give -PRON- plane to -PRON- country to save -PRON- from devastation very laudable ambition smile the general 
but have a care of course remember the author o in the air 
here -PRON- be back with another excellent air story different from the first one and just as excellent 
here be an aviation story of the future full of fight adventure and good science 
indeed the thing that the author bring out in this story be no more impossible year hence than the present airplane be impossible year ago 
and one should not scoff at the idea that one man singlehande could not have a successful battle with another nation 
-PRON- all depend on the power of the instrument that -PRON- have 
remember the monitor which in the civil war change naval warfare for all time 
this be a simple invention and -PRON- certainly have a lot to do with win the war 
what -PRON- author develop in this story may play just as critical a part in some future contest the world crucify -PRON- savior be master of the air i declare stoutly disdain -PRON- sarcasm 
some day -PRON- may acknowledge -PRON- 
a derisive titter follow this bold statement move that -PRON- adjourn this meeting suggest colonel brandon 
-PRON- be clear mr clare can not substantiate -PRON- claim under the rule lay down by the board 
colonel brandon have bitterly oppose -PRON- from the first 
i have carefully explain -PRON- propose plane but -PRON- laugh wisely and shake -PRON- head as i continue to plead -PRON- cause and i catch one wise member of the board tap -PRON- forehead sigpiificantly 
i turn bandit a last hot with anger i arise from -PRON- place at the table and glare at the smile and amused face of the expert 
i could tolerate -PRON- grin but -PRON- sarcastic word of doubt sting -PRON- to the quick 
i regret that after -PRON- weary week of wait senator ballantree have secure this audience 
gentleman i be through with -PRON- i snap give the senator a look of apology 
-PRON- be an aggregation of mossgrown antique 
-PRON- do not even know the first correct principle of airplane construction 
-PRON- stare blankly 
the first airplane designer follow the build and the movement of the bird to a large extent 
be i right quite right agree general morley 
which be the heavy section of a bird anatomy 
i demand 
why -PRON- breast of course 
correct 
but so far airplane engineer have overlook that fact 
therefore the first lesson -PRON- expert have to learn be to undersle -PRON- motor and shift -PRON- center of gravity 
good night gentleman 
discourage and aflame with resentment i walk along with shuffling step -PRON- heart rebellious and bitter 
i consider that the whole world be against -PRON- 
what matter -PRON- now that i cherish the give -PRON- for -PRON- work that terrible night in france when i rescue -PRON- buddie lon grand from -PRON- crash and burn plane what matter -PRON- scar of battle -PRON- month of sacrifice and toil when i seek to honor -PRON- country 
now that country shortsighted servant turn -PRON- down 
but despite all -PRON- resolve be unbroken by hook or crook i would build the master plane of -PRON- all 
but where be i to procure the necessary fund 
and where build -PRON- secretly 
the night be dark as befit -PRON- mood 
only now and then i glimpse the star through rift in the cloud 
i be disgust with life 
i have be buffet by fate and deny justice 
society have spurn -PRON- 
the thought surge through -PRON- like fire 
i stop and gaze about -PRON- in the gloom 
i be athrill with a new idea i would prey upon that society -PRON- plane and finally i walk on reckless as to direction or destination 
presently i reach the location of magnificent home in the suburb of the city 
here be wealth and power to which i have appeal in vain 
long string of chinese lantern suddenly attract -PRON- attention 
a party be in progress 
laughter and song drift to -PRON- on the lazy breeze 
the merry sound jar upon -PRON- nerve 
what business have other people be happy when i be so miserable 
but there be money there money that i need 
something i reckon now -PRON- must have be the devil prompt -PRON- to leave the walk and wander across the lawn 
keep within the shadow i soon gain a position where i could see and hear the gay gathering 
suddenly i hear voice near -PRON- and peep around a clump of shrubbery i see a young man and a girl seat on a lawn seat 
i note the girl rare beauty the gold of -PRON- hair and the blue of -PRON- eye which in the soft glow of the lantern sparkle like jewel 
the young man be comely with brown eye and a little crop of a mustache 
-PRON- next word electrifiiitl -PRON- 
yes dear i be ready to buy a plane at last 
i sell the sea and as i be late for the bank the whole twelve thousand be here 
-PRON- tap -PRON- breast as i draw back a hot surge of emotion sweep -PRON- from head to foot 
twelve thousand dollar 
with -PRON- i could succeed 
-PRON- should not carry so much money around with -PRON- say the girl in alarm 
-PRON- may be rob 
i gaze off over the crowd and perceive that at least one of the guest be an aviator for a plane stand on the lawn back of the mansion -PRON- white wing visible in the dusk 
the plane have be turn after landing and now stand face the golf link 
-PRON- be then that the tempter beckon 
for the first time in ny life i lose sight of the moral side of life and become a criminal in thought 
the urge to build a superplane have drive all other consideration from -PRON- mind 
the lover be in a secluded nook 
i tie a handkerchief over -PRON- face draw -PRON- revolver and step before -PRON- take that twelve thousand buddie i say quietly 
hand -PRON- over and make no outcry or i will kill -PRON- 
the girl start to rise then settle back stare belligerently as i flourish the gun 
but the young fellow slowly reach within -PRON- coat draw forth a fat envelope and hand -PRON- over without a word 
many thank old man i say 
consider this only as a loan 
both of -PRON- keep still for five minute 
then i leap away 
straight for the airplane i run 
nobody seem to notice -PRON- and i be seat ill the cockpit hold to the stick and press the starter button before i hear a cry of alarm 
the motor respond the propeller whir and i streak away over the lawn 
a run of a few rod then i give -PRON- the gun and zoom into the air at a dangerous angle 
rapidly i mount in a close spiral 
as i circle back over the lawn i see the guest gather in group gaze up at -PRON- and gesticulate madly 
but i be soon lose to -PRON- and the light of washington blink out in wall of whirl vapor 
in a few minute i be speed above the cloud with the soft starlight upon -PRON- 
now that i have escape where away i wonder 
i have no plan other than to get far away with -PRON- plunder 
i examine the gasoline gauge 
the tank be nearly full 
i have enough fuel for a long voyage 
and then i think of a haven for -PRON- operation 
several hundred mile to the south on a peak of the great smoky mountain be a freak of nature a level plateau of rock perhaps an eighth of a mile long and nearly as wide 
once while carry the mail i have make a force land there 
-PRON- be inaccessible from below for the rise sheerly two hundred foot on every side 
good of ail on one end be a shelter nook form by a great overhanging rock which be screen by a cluster of pine 
here i could house the plane safe from the eye of some aviator who may chance to wing -PRON- way over the peak 
here i could construct -PRON- plane 
but i need help for the task 
slowly and with great risk i must transport -PRON- material tothe mountain top under cover of the night 
i must construct a small machine shop with all -PRON- accessory 
and i could not do all this alone 
in -PRON- perplexity i think of lon grand good old lon 
-PRON- would do anything for -PRON- 
although -PRON- be suffer from the aftermath of many wound and -PRON- mind be somewhat clouded by shell shock -PRON- be an expert airplane mechanic whenever -PRON- wander fancy allow -PRON- to work at -PRON- 
but -PRON- be an unreliable employee sometimes wander away from -PRON- work for month and nobody know where -PRON- be 
however i feel sure that -PRON- would stick by -PRON- 
well without delay i seek lon find -PRON- and -PRON- agree to -PRON- scheme with enthusiasm 
the superplane will pass over the month of lonesome toil that follow the heartbreake disappointment and failure -PRON- many narrow escape from the search hand of the law many moody spell when i have to nurse -PRON- ambition and watch -PRON- as i would a hpby 
for more than two year -PRON- labor there on that gray mountain top 
but at last -PRON- be do the scourge of the air and -PRON- performance exceed -PRON- expectation 
when at last all be ready i seat -PRON- in the driver seat start the motor and seize the control 
straight into the sky -PRON- shoot at marvelous speed 
over -PRON- shoulder stand lon -PRON- great eye shine with wonder and delight 
then i try out the plane on the level -PRON- gyroscope maintain -PRON- perfectly 
and -PRON- descend vertically rapidly or slowly as -PRON- choose 
have anything go radically wrong with the mechanism of the plane i know that -PRON- would not crash for house in the wing in section of the frame in the casing of the cabin and in other special part make to contain -PRON- be -PRON- supergas noninflammable and of tremendous lifting power 
how i thank -PRON- lucky star that although i have give up -PRON- study iri chemistry to go to war i have resume -PRON- when i return 
while this gas be not strong enough to lift the plane and -PRON- load -PRON- render -PRON- buoyant so that the motor have only to drive -PRON- through the air 
this i know to be the airplane of the future the superplane which i have endeavor to give to -PRON- country 
the plane be armor well for warfare 
on both top and bottom as well as at each end be a long sharp steel spike for ram purpose 
the cabin and all vital part be protect by sheet of steel back by aluminum and asbestos 
the four propeller one at each end and one top and bottom be protect by machinegun fire 
in sailing on the level the propeller on the prow be pull the plane forward the one on the rear be drive -PRON- ahead 
those top and bottom use only in ascend and descending have a similar office 
the wing resemble those of a bird but comiaratively small and to be fold back on occasion be make of metal 
the tail flexible and expand follow that of a bird in flight as near as -PRON- be physically possible to make -PRON- 
the plane could not go into a tail spin or a nose dive because the center of gravity -PRON- great weight be underneath like that of a bird 
and the construction of the tail enable one to dive or ascend at any angle -PRON- may choose 
but now that i be ready to make the purblind servant of -PRON- country pay for -PRON- folly i be reluctant to do so 
-PRON- madness be over 
i have build -PRON- plane 
even with skilful help the triumph be mine 
besides -PRON- conscience have be newly awaken 
i long to get back into the rank of man to do some good with -PRON- plane to make amend for -PRON- folly 
but i could not see -PRON- way clear to do so 
i be an outlaw and justice would not forget 
perhaps some day i would give -PRON- up 
so i foolishly postpone the day of reckon 
the spirit of revenge urge -PRON- on and an opportunity to continue plunder whisper -PRON- alluring message 
how easy -PRON- all be 
lock and door be not on the roof of business block and bank and scuttle be seldom lock or if lock be easily open 
and i be able to land anywhere even on a roof but a rod or two square 
so the picking be easy 
unprepared for robber from the sky the police be nonplus 
-PRON- know not where or when i would strike 
always i fly without light and drop like a plummet from the sky 
to satisfy -PRON- foolish vanity i always leave -PRON- card on which i write the air master 
on the rare occasion when i obtain a newspaper i read account of -PRON- exploit and wild description of -PRON- plane which many have glimpse 
but after a few month the people wake up and the press of the entire country call loudly for an air police patrol for all city 
and soon on -PRON- nightly errand i behold the light on -PRON- clumsy plane dart above the town 
i laugh at -PRON- maneuver 
i could dodge -PRON- so easily 
lon patient and often in a daze ask no question and make no comment 
i often wonder whether -PRON- suspect the nature of -PRON- frequent trip to the north 
carefully i strove to keep -PRON- from -PRON- for i dread the accuse finger of -PRON- scorn 
lon be pure gold 
chase mellow night in the early fall i set out on a mission of restitution 
for the first time lon ask to accompany -PRON- and i have a hard time to convince -PRON- that -PRON- be well for -PRON- to go alone 
-PRON- seem to sense danger of some sort and of late -PRON- have be act more queer than usual 
at length -PRON- bow in silent agreement and i set out 
since the night i steal the money and the plane i have not see the girl of the golden hair but often i have see -PRON- in -PRON- dream 
with -PRON- i carry twenty thousand dollar in two package eight thousand for the owner of the plane i have steal and the remainder to reimburse the young man of the chaplin mustache 
i consider the girl the good medium through which to reach those person could i but find -PRON- 
these few short month of hectic crime have sadden -PRON- and teach -PRON- a lesson 
i be tired of -PRON- all 
take a long chance i fly low above the girl home drop low and low unobserved for the muffler reduce the motor noise to a minimum 
i notice a large plane stand on the same spot that have be occupy by the one i have forcibly borrow 
i see no one about so i land near -PRON- and carefully approach the house 
i have resolve to ring the bell ask for the young lady and boldly deliver the money into -PRON- hand 
if sloe should not be there then to some other member of the family 
should -PRON- plane be discover during -PRON- short absence -PRON- would fall into the hand of the police and i would become a fugitive on 4and with capture almost certain 
but once more luck be with -PRON- 
round the end of a hedge i almost stumble against the girl i seek 
-PRON- be sit beside the young man i have rob in much the same attitude i have behold -PRON- more than two year before 
the young man wear the uniform of the police air patrol and the bright wing jf an officer gleam upon -PRON- breast 
i wear no mask but -PRON- be evident -PRON- do not recognize -PRON- as the infamous air bandit 
bow to the young lady i take the package of money from -PRON- pocket convey this to the owner of the airplane that be steal from this lawn about two year ago i say toss the money in -PRON- lap 
and -PRON- -PRON- dear sir i continue hand the stare young fellow the other package be kind enough to accept this as restitution for the money -PRON- loan -PRON- that night 
i turn spring around the end of the hedge and rail for -PRON- plane 
but i be not to escape so easily 
the air bandit i hear the young man shout and almost with the word a bullet wing past -PRON- ear 
i look back over -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- be come after -PRON- fire as -PRON- run and the girl be close at -PRON- heel 
fortunately -PRON- aim be bad but suddenly from nowhere -PRON- seem servant of the estate come run to -PRON- assistance 
all may have be well have i not step into a depression of the ground and turn -PRON- ankle 
i stumble and fall within a rod of -PRON- plane but as i rise the air patrolman club -PRON- pistol be upon -PRON- fire as -PRON- run and the girl be close at -PRON- heel on again the girl at -PRON- side 
-PRON- cling to -PRON- desperately as -PRON- stagger forward 
at last i fell the young airman with a blow to the jaw throw off the cling hand of the girl and reach -PRON- plane 
in another minute i be shoot skyward like a rocket but even as i do so i see the airman rise to -PRON- foot and follow by the girl make for -PRON- own plane 
in a few minute -PRON- be in the air and climb steadily 
i smile for before -PRON- could gain altitude i would be off and away at a speed of nearly four hundred mile an hour 
but i have reckon wrong 
i soon become aware that the air above and around -PRON- be swarm with plane of the police air patrol 
evidently -PRON- have spot -PRON- and follow -PRON- as i fly over the city 
-PRON- errand of restitution be likely to cost -PRON- -PRON- liberty perhaps -PRON- life 
-PRON- good resolve -PRON- plan of reform fade away in a red mist of hate 
-PRON- seek -PRON- life and have no mercy 
what chance have anyway i ask -PRON- at the hand of justice 
-PRON- be blind and deaf and dumb and never forgave -PRON- err child 
now -PRON- be peck away at -PRON- with machine gun the bullet rattle against the strut of -PRON- plane and drum against the wall of the cabin 
-PRON- upward retreat be cut off by two plane which be nose down toward -PRON- 
i know that i could whip -PRON- but i desire to escape without bloodshed 
still other be close in from all side 
i see that i must fight that i must send down some of -PRON- foe 
how willingly i would have surrender could i have be sure of a square deal so far i have not shed blood in -PRON- life of unlawful gain 
i shrink from -PRON- even now 
the steel point on -PRON- plane could rip through cloth or wood or steel 
-PRON- landing gear fold up out of the way of the low point which could be make terribly effective in attack 
i have build the whole plane the same as i would have do have the government approve -PRON- idea 
so i dart aside and allow the two plane to spend -PRON- energy in the dive 
then as -PRON- flatten out below -PRON- i drop down with terrific speed 
the pilot of the police plane evidently daze by this novel method of attack and in the dark as to -PRON- intention maneuver to elude -PRON- 
too late 
in a twinkling the steelpointed bottom of -PRON- plane have rip away a wing of the near machine 
i turn sharply as -PRON- go plunge earthward 
before the other pilot have time to dge -PRON- i tear off -PRON- wing and -PRON- follow -PRON- comrade down to earth 
turn kidnapper dart upward again intend to get above -PRON- enemy and speed for home for i know that no plane could follow -PRON- but to -PRON- dismay i see that -PRON- way be again block this time by three plane and by -PRON- light i see other converge toward the battle area 
and now with reckless dare the three plane bear down 
to avoid -PRON- and gain a point of advantage i drop downward only to find a large plane directly in -PRON- path and so close that i could not avoid strike -PRON- 
as i accelerate -PRON- plunge and the steel point tear through the flimsy wing i be horrify to discover that -PRON- be the plane of the young airman and the goldenhaire girl 
now as -PRON- plane pitch crazily and begin to fall the young man -PRON- parachute on -PRON- back rise from the cockpit and prepare to leap motion the girl to follow 
but before -PRON- could leap flame sweep back from the motor and envelop -PRON- 
the girl be struggle desperately with -PRON- safety belt 
with the risk of be cripple by the fall plane i keep pace with -PRON- and keep draw nearer 
just as the flame reach -PRON- i lean over with -PRON- knife and cut the stubborn belt 
then i catch -PRON- beneath the arm and draw -PRON- aboard -PRON- own craft 
through a pall of smoke and flame i catch a glimpse of the airman as -PRON- go over the side 
by this time -PRON- enemy be press -PRON- close but have clear the burn plane -PRON- drop rapidly until -PRON- merely skim the earth 
the police plane dare not follow 
-PRON- dart between the tree fringe the golf link until the sky above be free from the enemy 
then -PRON- soar toward the star as though project from the muzzle of a gun 
back over the lawn the sky patrol be form for the pursuit 
as i have gain the desire altitude i force the motor to -PRON- utmost and soon the light of the pursue plane draw dim waver and be lose in the gloom 
until the light of the city have wink out in the darkness to rearward the girl maintain a stoical silence 
-PRON- sit stare at -PRON- intently -PRON- blue eye flame with hate 
-PRON- -PRON- monster -PRON- gasp at last 
-PRON- have kill lieutenant price a brave man a man sorely need by -PRON- country 
pardon -PRON- i say cringe under -PRON- intense gaze try to avoid strike -PRON- plane 
-PRON- lie -PRON- cry 
-PRON- be a murderer and a coward -PRON- eye fall under -PRON- fierce stare 
i would rather have die than be so accuse by this girl 
i realize bitterly that more than ever i be outside the law pale plead guilty to be a coward i say contritely 
but i be no murderer 
and i earnestly desire to quit -PRON- lawless game 
-PRON- smile scornfully 
where be -PRON- go -PRON- ask gaze about the cabin in wonder 
why didnot -PRON- land -PRON- so that i could go home coward be not always a fool i laugh bitterly 
from now until dawn all the searchlight in washington will be comb the sky for -PRON- 
and for day the air will be thick with plane of the air patrol 
and when -PRON- catch -PRON- -PRON- will die -PRON- assert 
no plane on earth be a match for -PRON- i say confidently nee not remind -PRON- that i be master of the air 
-PRON- gaze at -PRON- with widen eye which show no trace of fear only wonder curiosity and loathing 
-PRON- shall pay dearly for all of this -PRON- go on at last 
-PRON- father 
colonel brandon be a power in this land 
-PRON- father 
i say aghast 
be colonel brandon -PRON- father 
yes 
-PRON- be chief of the first air squadron of the army have meet -PRON- i say stare hard at -PRON- and wonder what imp of fate have lead -PRON- to -PRON- mansion that fatal night 
-PRON- be indeed a power but that power be often misplace 
misplace believe that be the correct word 
-PRON- father be a power in the government rejection of this plane 
-PRON- all feel that be a mistake 
i be sorry but -PRON- do not know 
exactly 
pardon -PRON- but like many other dumbbell connect with -PRON- government -PRON- deem -PRON- too wise to learn 
why donot -PRON- land -PRON- -PRON- demand imperiously know -PRON- can land anywhere at any time with this plane 
-PRON- would be too risky 
i donot want to subject -PRON- to unnecessary danger 
so i have conclude that -PRON- be to become -PRON- guest for a few day 
besides i rather like -PRON- 
-PRON- eye flare with indignation 
-PRON- mean -PRON- will take -PRON- to -PRON- home -PRON- exclaim incredulously 
the police have long maintain that -PRON- have a secret haven 
wise police i laugh 
then in a few day -PRON- wrill take -PRON- home will 
and in the meantime have no fear 
i will treat -PRON- as a gentleman should gentleman -PRON- sneer 
oh how i hate -PRON- hate -PRON- -PRON- finish 
thank -PRON- 
miss brandon 
-PRON- interest be ciate 
and when i return home i shall lead the air patrol back to -PRON- infamous lair 
-PRON- will not 
why 
because -PRON- be not in -PRON- nature to betray a trust 
i be trust -PRON- not to betray -PRON- 
-PRON- eye fall and -PRON- compress -PRON- lip 
i see that i be right 
-PRON- be not ungrateful 
but -PRON- refuse to talk further 
-PRON- sit stare disconsolately at the floor and i see that -PRON- be have a hard battle to keep back the tear 
war cloud 
i due time -PRON- arrive at -PRON- rocky home 
i make -PRON- as comfortable as possible and -PRON- do not complain 
lon look at -PRON- queerly a question in -PRON- great luminous eye but as usual -PRON- hold -PRON- peace and make no comment 
the next morning after breakfast -PRON- show keen interest in -PRON- surrounding ask numerous question 
i command -PRON- never to venture beyond the overhang rock for fear some pass plane may discover -PRON- 
lon and i never show -PRON- on the plateau in daylight and -PRON- constant dread be that some day some aviator may take a notion to land and explore this unique mountain top 
thus two day pass 
the scorn and the haughtiness have leave miss eye and -PRON- begin to talk in that tone of relief one assume when a dreaded danger fail to materialize 
-PRON- be sit on a rock out in the edge of the pine 
the warm sunshine filter through -PRON- branch where the bird be singe merrily maybe -PRON- say suddenly will be go home 
perhaps miss brandon 
but really there be no hurry 
pray do not mock -PRON- misery -PRON- reprove 
and please take -PRON- back home 
i can not remain away longer in time like these 
father i know be frantic with anxiety 
-PRON- need -PRON- 
any day -PRON- may be call to take command of -PRON- squadron 
any day some unwise and fiery word may explode the magazine of war 
war 
i exclaim incredulously -PRON- hear -PRON- cry in surprise 
nation across the sea be line up against -PRON- 
-PRON- have grant every honorable concession but there seem to be no way of prevent war 
word have come from reliable source that already a large air armada be form on the other side to swoop down upon -PRON- seaboard city 
-PRON- god 
i cry get to -PRON- foot and stare down at -PRON- expect -PRON- 
and yet -PRON- seem unthinkable 
the great war seem unthinkable until -PRON- come -PRON- remind -PRON- simply 
have -PRON- listen to -PRON- i may have save the day i say point to -PRON- plane house under the rock 
do -PRON- consider -PRON- situation hopeless -PRON- ask in alarm 
-PRON- be desperate to say the least thank to shortsighted official among whom if -PRON- will pardon -PRON- be -PRON- father 
-PRON- plane be woefully inferior in number and equipment 
but -PRON- have some good one and -PRON- pilot be skilful and brave 
-PRON- father be an able commander 
lieutenant price be like -PRON- noble and brave -PRON- add sadly 
father have secure -PRON- a pilot berth in the first air squadron and -PRON- future be bright 
-PRON- eye fill with tear and -PRON- look away that i may not see 
forgive -PRON- miss brandon but i believe that lieutenant price be more to -PRON- than a friend 
-PRON- be to be marry in the spring -PRON- say blush 
i stand look down at -PRON- a wild hope surge through -PRON- but i stifle -PRON- resolutely 
what be i that i dare dream such thing an air bandit who have sin beyond pardon 
tonight i will take -PRON- home i say with sudden resolution 
oh thank -PRON- -PRON- say spring up and seize -PRON- hand in a burst of gratitude be so glad 
i shall speak for -PRON- to -PRON- father and and who know -PRON- may yet get a chance to reform 
-PRON- can not be so awfully bad 
i bow -PRON- acknowledgment then turn away thankful for -PRON- gracious word 
early that night just as the star begin to blazon the sky -PRON- make ready 
for the second time lon ask to go along 
during all the weary month since come there -PRON- have not leave that lonesome rock 
so i could not refuse -PRON- request 
-PRON- soar high so high that -PRON- shiver with the cold but i know that the air police everywhere be on the lookout for -PRON- 
but when -PRON- have obtain a position directly over colonel mansion -PRON- drop straight down 
no plane be in sight 
the air be still 
a solemn hush be brood over the world 
a calm whose very completeness chill -PRON- heart seem to be soothe -PRON- to sleep 
perhaps -PRON- enemy be lurk in the shadow wait for -PRON- 
but i subdue this silly fear 
-PRON- have no cause to expect -PRON- 
-PRON- could only guess that i have rescue colonel daughter 
anyway i be reckless of consequence so reckless that i shoot the machine down upon the front lawn within a hundred yard of the house 
as i help the girl from the plane i see two man seat under the porch light lean toward each other and apparently engage in earnest conversation 
one of the man wear the uniform of the air patrol and -PRON- head be swathe in bandage 
the girl give a gasping cry 
thank god -PRON- murmur brokenly 
and then i see that -PRON- be lieutenant price 
wait i say hoarsely when -PRON- make ready to hasten away 
so perverse be human nature that i regret price have be save yet be glad for -PRON- sake 
go to those man explain briefly and then come back and tell -PRON- whether war have be declare 
-PRON- hesitate look first at the man then at -PRON- 
lon sit silently regard -PRON- 
go on i will take the risk i say 
make some excuse but come back alone 
i enlist i a fever of impatience and anxiety i wait 
i watch -PRON- run up the step see -PRON- father and -PRON- lover rise hurriedly and embrace -PRON- 
then for a few minute i know by -PRON- gesture that -PRON- be make an excited explanation 
suddenly -PRON- father hand -PRON- a newspaper which -PRON- merely glance at then -PRON- rush down the step and run toward -PRON- 
but in a moment -PRON- be follow by the lieutenant who by the aid of a cane come limp along shout for -PRON- to come back 
-PRON- have come -PRON- pant thrust the paper into -PRON- hand 
and there before -PRON- in great black headline be the awful truth war have be declare 
i have no time to learn more for lieutenant price be close upon -PRON- call loudly for -PRON- to surrender 
give -PRON- the gun lon i shout as i leap into the plane and pull the ascending throttle watch the lieutenant over -PRON- shoulder as i do so 
as the plane shoot into the sky i look down into -PRON- white upturned face and wave -PRON- hand in salute 
-PRON- fool -PRON- lon i say turn to -PRON- 
but i stare aghast 
i be alone 
intent on watch the girl and the lieutenant i have forget lon 
doubtless under one of -PRON- spell -PRON- have slip from the machine unobserved 
i could not go back for soon the air would be fill by plane of the air patrol 
curse -PRON- stupid folly in let -PRON- get away i plunge still high 
dear old lon as faithful a friend as man ever have 
-PRON- be to be year before i should see -PRON- face again when -PRON- be discover under startling and remarkable circumstance by which -PRON- clouded mind be clear and but that be another story 
on the way home i read the whole terrible news 
war have be force upon -PRON- country and -PRON- be almost defenseless in the air and because of this alone the enemy have strike 
-PRON- plane few in number and poorly armed be weak compare to the foe powerful bomber and fighter 
-PRON- city lie open and supine to a shower of fire and death from the sky 
the day i have fear have come and i be helpless to do anything 
if -PRON- have only listen to -PRON- how different would be the prospect a fleet of -PRON- master plane could repulse the combine air raider of the world 
reach home i house -PRON- machine and go to bed 
but i could not sleep 
lon and -PRON- uncertain fate and picture of war in -PRON- horror of blood and carnage rise before -PRON- 
after toss about for an hour i rise dressed and go out under the star 
dawn be tinge the east and in -PRON- pink depth -PRON- imagination picture black swarm of enemy plane wing -PRON- way over the sea to crush -PRON- 
and in dismay i imagine -PRON- puny aerial fleet try to stop -PRON- 
in frenzied fancy i see the death of many brave man see the slaughter of woman and child cower in -PRON- home while -PRON- roof blaze with fire 
for a time i be overcome with horror despair and remorse 
if i have only be more patient i may have win out under the law and now in this crisis i may be useful 
i may have save the day 
the thought drive -PRON- mad 
i sweep the starry heaven as though i would challenge and defy the universe 
i burn with a sudden resolve 
i would save the day 
i would make good -PRON- claim 
for be not i master of the air 
i would meet -PRON- and fight until overwhelmed 
i would redeem -PRON- 
afire with -PRON- mad resolution i begin -PRON- preparation at once 
i fill -PRON- atoline tank and go over the motor carefully 
that evening as the sun set in a crimson sky i rise into the air 
lonely as this rocky home have be i gaze back on -PRON- with a pang of regret 
-PRON- have shelter lon and -PRON- 
-PRON- have seem to appreciate -PRON- 
-PRON- have be kind 
i know that i would never see -PRON- again 
before i have be in the air an hour the full moon be bathe the earth in a soft glow 
the night be still 
i seem to be afloat in space 
all about -PRON- be peace 
-PRON- be hard for -PRON- to realize that i be bend on an errand of destruction that brother human in madness and hate would soon be seek -PRON- life 
but at last when i soar above the street of all be change 
the street be teem with mill masse of man woman and child whose cry and shout rise to -PRON- in a hoarse murmur of fear 
i drop lower over the avenue even enter some of -PRON- drop as low as the secondstory window 
here i hear the newsboys shrilly proclaim the dire news that already boston have be bomb -PRON- public building destroy thousand make homeless and that the city have be surrender to the enemy 
i also learn that the enemy be muster -PRON- plane to move on new york 
colonel brandon with the first air squadron supplement by many private plane have go out to meet the foe 
somewhere above hill -PRON- grimly await the enemy 
battle at last 
i be enough 
i wait at hear no more 
amid the excited cry of the people who point at -PRON- machine and wave -PRON- arm excitedly i shoot upward far above the tall building and set -PRON- course to the northeast 
in less than an hour i come upon the fleet of defense 
back and forth the plane move in battle formation 
i move among -PRON- draw -PRON- excited attention but i be receive as a friend 
doubtless colonel brandon have recognize -PRON- and have radio that although i be an outlaw i be an american and be to be let alone 
i be mighty thankful for have i be attack -PRON- would have disorganize -PRON- plan 
for an hour i fly among -PRON- with no enemy in sight 
at last impatient at the delay i fly to an altitude of ten thousand foot then speed east 
in ten minute i see -PRON- come fly rather low but in splendid order 
-PRON- form a mighty array the whole heaven to the east seem to be fill with -PRON- a veritable cloud of death 
the roar of -PRON- motor blend in a dreadful dirge which to -PRON- overwrought sense sound like the voice of doom 
flush with victory conscious of -PRON- prestige confident of success -PRON- come swiftly on with gleam light disdain concealment or surprise 
i look to the west 
-PRON- plane have sight -PRON- 
-PRON- be come on boldly but with no light come on like lamb to the slaughter 
i have never pray 
i know nothing about god or heaven but then and there i stumble through an agonize plea for -PRON- countryman 
earnestly i ask the ruler of the universe to help -PRON- 
i wait until the main body of the enemy be directly under -PRON- 
lead the van i pick out a giant plane 
this i recognize by -PRON- position as the flagship of the fleet doubtless the ship of itso the note oriental ace and the chief of the fleet 
-PRON- time have come the hour for which i have yearn with all -PRON- heart and soul the opportunity to demonstrate in battle the superior merit of -PRON- invention in defense of -PRON- country 
i be athrill with a mad joy 
i be about to die 
peace and contentment be to be -PRON- at last 
such a death i would welcome 
with awful swiftness i approach the flagship 
the roar of the motor below be deafen the colored light of so many aircraft bewilder but i allow nothing to detract -PRON- from -PRON- aim 
straight in -PRON- center i cut through the upper wing then as i turn back tear -PRON- completely off 
the great plane stagger as i back away 
then plunge forward like a mighty battering ram i strike the low wing and cut -PRON- in twain 
the plane swing out of control 
-PRON- pilot strove mightily to right -PRON- while -PRON- companion empty -PRON- automatic at -PRON- 
however in a moment the plane lurch then dove straight down 
for a fleeting instant as the other plane roar past i catch a glimpse of the once noble ship reel drunkenly toward the earth 
halt by this sudden calamity and for a few minute confuse the enemy pause swing back and come after -PRON- furiously 
one appear directly over -PRON- but even as -PRON- gunner train -PRON- machine gun i shoot up through -PRON- wing rip -PRON- away and send -PRON- lurch down to join -PRON- commander 
as the other try to close in i back away thus confuse -PRON- 
then i zoom above -PRON- 
three of -PRON- speedy plane follow 
i lead -PRON- on until -PRON- be beyond support distance of -PRON- comrade then i charge -PRON- one at a time 
dart here and there i cut -PRON- to piece and send -PRON- down whirl masse of wreckage 
i drop down once more then draw off as half a dozen plane attempt to charge -PRON- 
again i retreat -PRON- machinegun bullet rattle off -PRON- armor liarmlessly 
once more i turn suddenly ram -PRON- retreat strike -PRON- top and bottom confuse -PRON- by -PRON- sudden and unexpected maneuver until all be send crash down 
far below the enemy be reform 
plane be circle here and there get into position again 
by -PRON- flash light and the light of the moon i see another large plane take position at the head of the squadron 
i get above -PRON- 
like some black monster from the world of darkness i drop swiftly noiseless as a phantom 
before -PRON- be aware of -PRON- presence i strike the plane a terrible blow 
-PRON- reel and before -PRON- could recover i strike -PRON- again and again while -PRON- companion try to get into position to protect -PRON- 
at last -PRON- plunge down and i again draw off 
this time nearly the whole fleet seem bent on follow -PRON- 
i see that -PRON- be become demoralize by -PRON- swift and peculiar onslaught 
again i lead -PRON- a merry race 
-PRON- could not overtake -PRON- 
-PRON- could not get above -PRON- 
tliey could not anticipate -PRON- move or guard against -PRON- attack 
only when i entice one or two away from -PRON- fellow i strike 
-PRON- fight bravely stubbornly but -PRON- have no chance 
the terrible steel spike gore -PRON- like the horn of an angry bull 
with bewilder speed and uncanny aim i rise against -PRON- fall upon -PRON- turn in small circle and tear off -PRON- wing 
-PRON- movement be so swift and unexpected and the evolution of -PRON- plane so awkward and slow that i have -PRON- at -PRON- mercy 
glance down exultingly i see that the ground be become litter with the wreck of the enemy 
i be drunk with the spirit of battle 
work -PRON- stick with reckless ferocity i yell at -PRON- foe taunt -PRON- lead -PRON- on and dare -PRON- to come and take -PRON- 
but of course the general tumult the roar of the motor and the crash of impact the sputter of machine gun and the rend and splintering of the wing prevent -PRON- voice reach -PRON- 
but -PRON- didnot matter 
i be slay -PRON- country foe 
-PRON- whole fleet be bend on -PRON- destruction but -PRON- could not reach -PRON- 
give -PRON- a little more time and i would have -PRON- all 
surely i be master of the air 
but i realize that soon i must die 
death grin at -PRON- from every side but i laugh in -PRON- grisly face 
but the plane come on and oh 
-PRON- very victory be weaken -PRON- 
i could not long stand the mad pace 
soon i must be crush by weight of number and send crash down to -PRON- doom 
the air terror hen suddenly the plane begin to draw off 
-PRON- pay no attention to -PRON- and look below i see the cause 
the enemy light be wigwag frantically 
-PRON- be reform and i understo that -PRON- attacker have be radio to get back in the line 
off to the east be the poignant reason the american fleet be near the scene 
soon -PRON- be engage in a desperate battle 
i see the light on the plane dip up and down charge and retreat and spin in dizzy circle 
-PRON- countryman be fight with a skill and dare worthy the tradition of the american ace but -PRON- be hopelessly outnumbered and i realize the bitter outcome of the struggle 
for a few minute i sit gaze at the spectacle fascinate by the play of the plane dart about like grotesque ghost in the shimmering moonbeam 
the roar of the mighty conflict rise to -PRON- on the wind sound like distant surf pounding on the shore 
every little while i would see a burn ship go whirl down to earth 
i be witness the first real air battle of history 
and here america who cradle the airplane must go down in bitter defeat 
the thought set -PRON- on fire 
the last remnant of -PRON- reason flee and i become mad 
i would kill kill kill 
and in -PRON- rage i would be content to give up -PRON- life 
i know little of what take place during the remainder of that historic fight 
-PRON- come to -PRON- in hazy fragment as i write and but for the note take at the time by friend i could not tell -PRON- story 
i only know that i seem to be in the center of a revolving seething blister hell scream -PRON- challenge ram retreat surge forward ascend descending send -PRON- foe crash to earth ask no quarter and give none 
suddenly i realize that more than twothird of the american plane be down and over half of the enemy 
the latter now draw off reform and then come tear back against the american line 
colonel plane be still intact 
i recognize -PRON- by the paint star and stripe 
i know that likely lieutenant price hold the control 
even as this thought surge through -PRON- brain i see the lieutenant bandage head peep a moment from a window 
now the battle be on once more in all -PRON- fury 
i see with dismay that the enemy be concentrate -PRON- attack on the plane 
by adroit maneuvering -PRON- be seek to separate -PRON- from -PRON- squadron 
dipping and banking and zoom upward then loop back again -PRON- be strive to escape -PRON- net 
by this time -PRON- plane be badly batter by bullet 
some of the gas chamber have be penetrate and empty of -PRON- content 
the frame be bent and twist by -PRON- terrific encounter -PRON- forward propeller be out of commission and -PRON- ataline be run low 
i realize that this would be -PRON- last attack 
here in the midst of -PRON- all i hope to meet -PRON- end 
-PRON- onslaught be as terrible as -PRON- be sudden 
in a few minute i have dispose of three of the plane 
earthward -PRON- plunge in spiral of writhe fire illuminate the ground with a ghastly glow 
now however a chance shot break -PRON- rear propeller 
i could only rise above and hurl -PRON- down on -PRON- foe 
-PRON- be then that three more plane close in on the colonel and -PRON- heroic pilot 
-PRON- be below -PRON- 
like a thunderbolt i hurl -PRON- down on one of the plane crash clear through -PRON- wing 
as -PRON- fall i swing up against the wing of another shear -PRON- off close to the cabin 
but even with these victory i see that the odd be too great for -PRON- 
the remain plane be get the good of the colonel and other be come to -PRON- aid 
in desperation i dove down on this plane with all the power of -PRON- motor 
the impact be terrific 
i break the plane almost in two 
-PRON- wing crumple and flame leap from -PRON- motor 
as -PRON- plunge i have difficulty lift -PRON- plane free from the wreckage 
as i do so i accidentally strike the plane which badly crippled be slowly fall 
in vain i try to extricate -PRON- from -PRON- landing gear but i be wedge in tightly and the crippling of both forward and rear propeller prevent -PRON- withdraw horizontally 
faster and faster -PRON- fall the tremendous weight of the flagship press upon and carry -PRON- along with -PRON- 
in the last desperate grapple with the enemy -PRON- have lose altitude so that now only a few hundred foot separate -PRON- from the earth 
-PRON- seem to be age in fall 
i know that -PRON- be all over with -PRON- and be glad for -PRON- would settle -PRON- problem 
and then the grinding rend shock the poignant pain the flashing light and bloodre mist that be swallow up in darkness 
i revive in a hospital 
the nurse say that i have be there six week 
-PRON- seem -PRON- have take -PRON- from the wrecke of the plane a mass of broken bone and laceration but the surgeon have patch -PRON- up pretty well though -PRON- say that i would never walk again 
the nurse inform -PRON- that colonel brandon and lieutenant price the shock break by -PRON- plane have escape with minor cut and bruise 
with this meager information i have to be content for the nurse give -PRON- a sleep powder 
but the next day colonel brandon and the young lieutenant accompany by miss brandon carry a huge bunch of rose come to visit -PRON- 
the colonel take -PRON- good hand in both -PRON- own and gaze down on -PRON- patched face compassionately 
-PRON- win old man -PRON- say at last 
the enemy have leave -PRON- shore and the war be over 
pray accept -PRON- apology 
war have leave -PRON- shore i say unable to believe -PRON- sense 
yes after -PRON- last spectacular attack the enemy become discouraged and withdraw toward boston 
-PRON- force reenforce by the second squadron and private plane follow and win a sweeping victory 
-PRON- priceless plane be salvage and copy 
uncle sam will settle with -PRON- for that 
work night and day in many factory -PRON- be turn -PRON- out by the hundred 
so that with -PRON- -PRON- be sure to win the war if -PRON- ever attack -PRON- again be glad i say fervently 
but -PRON- all matter little to an outlaw i add sadly 
the colonel laugh 
-PRON- turn to lieutenant price 
lieutenant what chance for a pardon do -PRON- think an outlaw have who have save -PRON- country 
-PRON- may envy mr clare the reception that await -PRON- smile the lieutenant 
-PRON- deserve -PRON- add miss brandon smile at -PRON- and arrange in a vase the rose -PRON- have bring 
and so -PRON- tale come to an end 
how the war be win be history now 
i be proud that i have a humble part in the victory 
and i be happy to add that -PRON- pardon be complete 
i be content now happy as i go about the factory in -PRON- wheel chair look after the construction of -PRON- beloved plane

page what be the chemical characteristic of -PRON- departmeot be open to reader who wish to have answer qoe possible illustration will be use to answer the question 
query tion on aviation 
as far as space will permit all question deem should be brief and not more than three should be put in any letter of general interest to -PRON- reader will be answer bei and where address all communication to the editor 
something about fuselage cover editor axnation forum -PRON- announcement of the beginning of a question and answer department for aviation strike a responsive chord in -PRON- know -PRON- will be very welcome to -PRON- reader 
however i would be careful to limit the kind of question to be answer 
many people have peculiar idea about what to a and -PRON- question be of no earthly interest to any but -PRON- 
if -PRON- question fall under that scope please do not take up -PRON- valuable space with -PRON- 
what be the usual covering for the fuselage of a plane 
what be -PRON- advantage 
what be mean by streamline the fuselage 
why be -PRON- do 
birmingham ala 
fuselage frame be cover in order to reduce the air friction over -PRON- 
plywood or dural sheet be generally use sometimes both if the covering be merely to contribute to the reduction of resistance 
there be a number of dope fabric which still further reduce resistance of air over the fuselage 
the use of lubricate oil have also be suggest and try out 
by streamline be mean the shaping of the fuselage or any other part for that matter so as to xuce -PRON- air friction to the minimum 
certain shape in pose through the air have a much sill friction than other just as a narrow wellshape prow of a boat have less friction through the water than one with blunt prow 
editor what be retractible landing gear 
editor aviotion forum would -PRON- please tell -PRON- through the column of -PRON- aviation forum department what the meaning of the retractible landing gear be 
also what be -PRON- purpose or purpose if there be more than one 
montreal onada 
the retractible landing gear be the wheel which can be lift into a recess in the low part of the plane provide for -PRON- when the plane be in ffight 
the purpose be to reduce the resistance of the wheel through the air 
this by the way follow the flight of bird who draw -PRON- leg close to -PRON- body while in flight 
of course on amphibian plane which be design to land cither on sea or water the wheel be draw up so that -PRON- will not be immerse in the water while the plane be float on -PRON- pontoon hdfior 
what limit speed 
editor aviation forum hugo gernsback be still on the job find out what pple want before -PRON- know -PRON- want -PRON- 
the aviation forum idea be certainly a good one and i know -PRON- will go over big with -PRON- reader 
-PRON- magazine certainly look like a worldbeater 
could -PRON- tell -PRON- through -PRON- column what -PRON- be that really limit the spe of a plane 
be -PRON- something in the air condition or something naturally limit in the airplane idea 
why canot tremendous speed be develop 
albany 
as a roan write about interplanetary travel say nothing but a case of brute the same thing may be apply to the speed of airplane 
give a power plant with suflicient horsepower speed far beyond anything -PRON- have reach be possible 
what limit -PRON- plane now be just this 
accompany the increase of spe of a plane there an increase of air resistance 
but the air resistance increase with tho square of the speed and therefore the power necessary to send the plane through the air roust increase with the square of the speed 
therefore if the speed be double the power necessary must be multi ply by four 
multiply a speed by three mean a powr plant nine time as powerful 
therefore with power plant limit to the size -PRON- be and the power plant be often govern by other structural detail of the plane the speed be correspondingly what be relative editor aviation forum relative to -PRON- new department on question and answer on aviation i would like to know what the relative weight of the various part of an average airplane be 
in otheer word how much do each part contribute to the total weight what percentage of the total weight be dead weight and how much be load 
i think that the forum idea be a very good one and i know -PRON- meet with -PRON- own personal approval 
i weight of part simply canot learn enough about aviation 
bridgeport crax 
as indicate in the diagram show the total deadweight of the plane be about of the total weight 
of this the structure fuselage and wis comprise and the power plant that mean that the pay load can be about of the total load the plane will carry dor 
winqicompfefe mfhbwmg proheller tail and fih deadweight control strudurefiiselaae and wmqs power plan 
totd lainde diagram show percentage of total weight of plane each part have 
from aviation guide henley 
how be editor 
aviation forum will -PRON- please explain or indicate if -PRON- can through -PRON- aviation fomm just bow a plane get -PRON- socalled lift i nave be try to puzzle -PRON- out mysdf and have be unable to 
jnst what force be act on a plane to keep -PRON- aloft 
detroit mich 
as indicate in the diagram a plane be keep in the air by the pressure of air under -PRON- wing due to the spe of the plane 
the shape of the wing or aerofoil as -PRON- be call be such that the air pressure pile up under the wing and cause an area of reduced pressure above the wing 
thus the difference of pressure on the two side of the wing cause an upward thrust on the wing to balance the weight of the plane 
editor diagram show the action of the air pressure on a wing 
note the nature of the lifting force 
from modern aircraft pag6 
what determine minimum fly speed 
editor aviation forum i be very glad to bear that -PRON- have establish a department to answer question on aviation 
such a department should make a valuable addition to a magazine which already i think be take -PRON- place among the front rank of periodical devote to aviation 
what i should like to know be what determine the minimum fly speed of a plane 
be -PRON- the same for all planesf qeveland ohio 
the minimum fly speed of a plane be determine by the necessary to develop a pressure under the wing and a vacuum on top of -PRON- to maintain the weight of the plane 
each factor in the problem be dependant on other 
that be give a certain area of wing surface and a certain weight of plane the amount of upward lift per unit area on the wing surface multiply by the area of the wing must equal the weight of the plane 
therefore the minimum flying speed be that necessary to give the necessary wing lift mr square inch or square foot 
naturally a light plane with a large wing area will need a rouen small minimum of fly speed than a heavy plane with a small wing area 
editor 
what kind of tractive effort be there 
editor avition forum what be the kind of tractive effort that can be give to a plane 
this be -PRON- question to start off the work of aviation forum 
although some may object to have some nonfiction material in a fiction magazine yet if the fiction be scientific and be design to instruct as well as entertain how can the reader be pleased if not through acauainte -PRON- with the meaning of the thing toat be speak of in the story 
i would appreciate an answer to -PRON- question in an early issue 
boston mass 
the two general type of traction give to a plane be call tractor and pusher 
in the first the propeller which by -PRON- rotation provide the tractive power cut the air and by a screw motion ils the plane through the air 
the propeller in this case be in front of the plane 
the pusher propeller be in back of the plane and by -PRON- action -PRON- s the plane through the air 
of course there be a third type which be be experiment on and promise well and that be the rocket type 
by the rapid expulsion of highly compress gas into the air with a tremendous force the reaction of the force tin an opposite direction to -PRON- propel the plane 
bditor 
continue on page auxiliary wing to prevent stall a new device to prevent stalling be find in the new fernic distance cruiser a monoplane which will be put through -PRON- test shortly 
the method of prevent stall very commonsense be the use of an auxiliary wing just over the nose of the plane 
there be so an additional landingwheel under the nose which will prevent a noseover when the plane land 
the plane have a wingspread of sixty foot and be equip with wright whirlwind motor 
-PRON- be expect to make a nonstop flight to some european field this summer 
german invent 650mile an hour plane i an interview with the new york time herr perl a twentyone year old german describe a new plane a fly fish with which be expect to fly at an altitude of foot at speea reach mile per hour this basis -PRON- believe -PRON- can fly to new york from berlin in hour at a fuel cost of only the plane which be foot long and weigh pound ba one horsepower motor 
the plane be hermetically seal and a constant pressure be maintain within the cabin 
the wing be shape like those of a fly flsh with small stabilize fin on the tail 
the plane will not only be able to fly but also to swim for the landing wheel etc will be draw into the body thus present a fishlike shell to the water 
accord to wythe william of the time einstein as well as count arco president dt the telefunken company builder of great radio station as well as prominent professor have express the belief that perl have a plane which can reach the high altitude necessary to obtain such great speed 
new propeller to double speed a nother revolutionary invention be that of kalmanson of brooklyn who claim accord to the new york world to have invent a propeller which will not only double the speed of a plane but bring a mark saving in fuel 
the propeller come in two part which may be use singly in front and in back of the plane or both together 
-PRON- consist of four airspoon two on each blade 
the front two bring the air to the other two give the propeller a great tractive effect on the air 
the inventor also claim that the plane can not go into an involuntary nose dive with bis device and that -PRON- can make a landing within a short distance 
new singlelande wheel amphibian develop a new plane with a single landing wheel that allow the plane to ride on land like a bicycle and yet land on and take off from the water have be develop and successfully test by the grover loene company 
the landing gear can be guickly lift or lower accord to whether -PRON- be wish to alight on land or on water 
the wheel draw into a little pocket in the main float which be seventeen foot long and thirty inch wide 
a small door open and close to receive the wheel or let -PRON- out 
a lever in the cockpit operate the wheel 
the additional weight on the plane be about pound moth plane be use by the company equip with cirrus mark motor and a reduction in speed of only mile an hour be occasion 
new giant plane ready soon -PRON- world large plane which be be construct by dorni in germany will be ready within two month accord to a wireless to the new york time 
-PRON- will have twelve horsepower motor and will carry passenger 
-PRON- speed will be mile per hour 
the length of the plane will be about foot and -PRON- wing span foot 
the useful load will be ton and the dead weight ton 
the motor will be in pair on the upper side of the wing 
phis will permit repair during a flight 
the plane be construct of duralumin 
liberty motor yield to scientific advance -PRON- liberty motor the pride of the american air force during the world war at last yield to the development of motor cceile -PRON- and no longer be use in the first line air force accord to a new york time despatch 
these motor which be the result of the pooling of all patent during the war have serve -PRON- usefulness as the recent army maneuver in ohio prove -PRON- to be mile an hour slower than the new pratt and whitney motor bomber 
the liberty motor plane win be relegate to the army repair base at middletown pa where -PRON- will be use in training student pilot 
scientist study bird flight elieve that many of the secret of airplane design will come from a study of the navigation of bird 
dr austin clark of the smithsonian institution have write a very interesting paper on bird flight accord to the new york world 
the fact be well know -PRON- say that large bird have small wing while small bird have large one and must move -PRON- more quickly to maintain -PRON- flight 
upward air current and momentum arc what maintain the large bird 
the large bird however have more difficulty than the small in get start and need more open space 
soar on the part of bird be possible only when the sun be shine so that warm air be rise and -PRON- can take advantage of upward air current 
-PRON- be thus force to soar in circle to keep within this column of air 
foolproof plane contest near close -PRON- contest for the good foolproof plane which the average man or woman can fly nsore by the guggenheim fund for the promotion of aeronautic be near a close say lauren lyman in the new york time 
very few know plane have already be enter in the contest which will award prize of and a great deal of mystery surround the actual plan of airplane maker 
believe that the average man or woman will not y until the foolproof plane have be develop one which do not need any aeronautical expert to safely pilot the guggenheim fund be make the condition that plane must fulfill rather exact 
for example one of the nine condition state that the aircraft must show -PRON- ability to takeoff or land on a plot foot square surround by a twentyfive foot obstruction although the date set for the close of the contest be october only one plane have actually submit -PRON- at mitchel field long island for thete 
thi be a brunncrwinkle biplane build brooklyn several other entry be definitely know but only the one plane have reach the test stage 
invent gravity conquer plane of england claim to have patent a plane which will be free from the influence of gravity and will be able to fly mile per hour 
take advantage of the theory of einstein and sir thomson about the nature of gravitation -PRON- have construct on paper -PRON- machine to rise or descend vertically 
ho will control the magnetism which be the same as gravity accord to the einstein principle by the use of electricity 
-PRON- will thus enable jwple to travel from the united state to europe in five hour 
-PRON- be most skeptical about the truth of the above despatch 
editor 
monster british airship acme of comfort the finish touch be make on the monster british airship those who have be allow to inspect -PRON- declare -PRON- to be as luxurious as any firstclass hotel accord to a cable to the new york time 
the giant dirigible be foot long and will have cubic foot of hydrogen 
-PRON- have a dining saloon for person a main lounge foot by on each side of the lounge be a sevenfoot wide veranda with hand rail 
comfortable settee club chair and lounge will allow the passenger to relax while large window will allow the view of the scenery below and will permit plenty of sunlight to enter 
the exact date of the completion be still unknown 
multimotor do not always prevent accident hat the ability of a multimotore plane to prevent the accident due to stall of one motor be overrate be the belief of reginald cleveland in the new york time 
ho cite the case of a recent imperial airway plane fall into the english 
channel despite the fact that -PRON- be multimotore 
the essential point be -PRON- say that if one motor or two motor fail the rest must be able to give the plane -PRON- minimum fly speed and maneuverability 
this be be take care of in many new plane where horsepower capacity be be take care of by and horsepower in motor 
further passenger plane be not be load to the limit of -PRON- capacity thus increase further the margin of safety 
award damage on device navy use -PRON- history of a typical attempt to dispose of a revolutionary invention come to light when rear admiral bradley fiske retire be award damage of from rear admiral william moffett chief of the bureau of naval aeronautic on -PRON- invention of the torpedo plane which the navy have be use 
in say admiral fiske to the new york time -PRON- foresee the value of the plane and suggest the dropping of torpedo from -PRON- 
the navy department -PRON- clairn laugh at -PRON- idea and finally -PRON- develop -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- find that the idea be practicable the only thing necessary be to devise a means of steer the torpedo once release 
this be work out successfully but still the navy -PRON- be say refuse to accept -PRON- 
fiske find later however that the navy be use -PRON- device 
in the air terror in this issue mr morrow have picture a case so similar that -PRON- seem prophetic 
editor 
fly boat will mark future tran atlantic flight hat the recent attempt of flyer in seaplane to fly between spain and america have prove the worthiness of the fly boat be the belief of allen write the new york world the case of ramon franco who waa lose in the azore for ten day and rescue with -PRON- machine almost as good as new be mention as one of the strong argument for the plane able to alight on the water 
the future flight by plane will be in the opinion of mr allen a seaplane make stop at the azore and possibly newfoundland equip fully with navigator and radio and possess adequate weather information although the singlemotore land plane will still mark the flight that be do for gloiy and publicity the substantial flight for commercial aviation will be in plane equip for the water 
fly by radio beacon to be test i a series of test to be conduct at mitchel field island an attempt will be make to determine the real value of the radio beacon as a means of guide a pilot oyer -PRON- course 
in the test which be to be conduct by the guggenheim foundation lieut 
jame doolittle an army flier will fly blind unable to seo -PRON- course from -PRON- cockpit 
-PRON- will guide only by little lamp set in front of -PRON- 
the radio beam send out will cause certain light to glow if -PRON- be off -PRON- course on cither side and another to glow if -PRON- be on -PRON- course 
a request be be make to the federal radio commission for a wave of meter kilocycle on which to conduct the test 
flier who use the radio beacon system be now guide by dot and dash receive audibly through headphone 
by the new idea -PRON- be faop to do away with -PRON- and have only visual signal 
german plan tran atlantic service for the inauguration of regular plane service between germany and brazil at first and later between 
germany and the united state be the program of lufthansa the great german air company 
limit by the short distance to be cover in central europe the company be look toward the service as the logical development of -PRON- passenger service 
spain to be the point of departure from europe with brazil as the south american terminus 
trial trip with three rohrhackroraar fly boat be to begin shortly 
the zeppelin interest however be still try to establish a definite service 
in addition to the zeppelin -PRON- be build a fly boat to be equip with twelve motor 
when the service be start satisfactorily the lufthansa hope to inaugurate a far eastern line go to shanghai on the one hand and through siberia on the other 
glide now become an art liding be no longer a matter of jump from a hillside hold onto a pair of wing and wait until the initial cnorgy be dissipate before one descend to earth but have oecotne a new art of take advantage of air current say major ernst in the zeitung leipzig 
from the first crude effort of man to remain aloft in a plane without a motor have come a sport which in germany at least have allow flight of eight hour 
propel by a catapult from the top ef a hill in the static flight which be the first flight try the glider would float down the hillside until -PRON- naturally descend to the ground 
but in the dynamic flight the pilot with an uncanny sense for air current will face into those current and have -PRON- keep -PRON- aloft for many hour 
-PRON- have be find that air current be find flow up a hillside 
if the wind be light -PRON- will balance the glider on the way down 
strong wind will actually lift -PRON- give -PRON- a high altitude than -PRON- start with dynamic effect of various type of countryside be be exploit and a large body of knowledge be be build up about -PRON- effect on the glider 
furthermore the construction of the glider be be study in to determine how to reduce weight and give -PRON- a great lifting power 
autogiro perform new feat say report a from the headquarter of senor juan dc la cierva inventor of the autogiro state that -PRON- have improve -PRON- machine 
at a recent test near madrid -PRON- be say to have fly vertically to a height of meter about foot despite a strong headwind remain motionless in the air for a minute and then descend vertically with the motor shut off -PRON- choose spot 
two more ship line plan plane service ollowe the announcement that the united state line be contemplate a shiptoshore plane service to cut the time for mail by almost a day there come the plan of the french line and the north carman lloyd line to attempt a similar service if suitable plane can be find 
the breman the new ship of the german line would have a plane meet -PRON- six hundred mile at sea and pick up mail and possibly passenger 
if this be do also at the european terminus the water trip would be cut down by onethird last year an attempt be make by the french line to use a plane service for the lie de france but the proper plane be not available 
news of the month portray in plain yet concise language every important aviation advance during the month 
nowhere can the average reader get such a wealth of accurate and vital information condense into such a small volume 
some aviation magazine and newspaper be utilize by -PRON- editor in the compilation of this department 
the publisher welcome short contribution to these page from the various scientific institution laboratory maker and distributor of plane etc fly law for intrastate fly believe near ue to the complexity of the legal situation regard license for pilot and plane not engage in interstate flying and therefore not subject to federal regulation the making of state law be believe near 
under the federal law all pilot and plane fly across state line must obtain federal license and submit to federal inspection of plane 
flyer engage in only one state however have the privilege of obtain federal license if -PRON- wish to obtain the certificate 
there arc leave therefore intrastate flyer who do not take the federal license or any other 
a state law require all flyer to have federal license be one way out of the dilemma while the setting up of -PRON- state requirement equivalent to the federal be another 
plane wait for overdue train a ccording to report of newspaperman invite to make the trial trip over the lindbergh line airrail route from los angele to new york -PRON- be the train that provide the irregularity in schedule bolde up the plane on one occasion for an hour and a half 
the route which be mile long have mile of airway and mile to be covert by rail 
but despite this the plane have be uniformly on time while traii principally over the santa fe railroad which go between oklahoma and new mexico have provid a good deal of irregularity 
a correspondent however write in the new york world believe that when winter come the situation will be reverse and the trainman may then vent -PRON- ire on the pilot force to buck fog snow and sleet 
siberia within five day of new york -PRON- possibility of reach the old world by way of alaska and siberia be prove recently when a piano make a commercial voyage between fairbank alask and cape north siberia say lauren lyman in the new york time 
the trip of mile both way be make by noel wien of the wien alaskan airway to bring supply to an isolated trading post and to bring back a load of fur value at the time take for the trip plus the record make of a trip from new york to nome of four and a half day place the siberian post within five day of new york crash not always a crash hat some of the undesirable publicity give aviation mishap be cause by the mdiscriminate use of the word crash in the newspaper be the opinion of the boston herald 
a crash occur only when the plane come down out of control in which case serious injury can result to the occurant 
but many socalled crash in which minor injury occur be only force landing 
these say the paper be on a par with an automobile run onto a curb and should be give no more publicity 
mention the comparative safety of aviation the paper name harry jone of old orchard maine who have carry passenger in year without a mishap to any 
house insure against airplane crash the crashing of an airplane on the summer home of the governor of new jersey recently there have come a demand for insurance by home owner against similar occurrence 
for with the growth ef air traffic there will come a corresponding increase in the chance of have an airplane suddenly descend on one 
the mayflow fire and marine insurance company be meet this demand by issue policy on home 
plane make successful pickup at sea -PRON- first successful pickup and dropping of mail between a plane and a liner at sea be make when a fairchild monoplane use the adam pickup apparatus droppra a bag of mail on the deck of the leviathan and pick up a bag from the liner without stop 
tke liner bad leave -PRON- pier bind for europe at p ro 
at about six oclock the plane leave keyport and a half hour later nad overtake the liner 
the plane drop -PRON- bag of mail but in the first attempt to make a pickup -PRON- fail 
maneuver back and forth the plane let down a ball at the end of a cable which be to catch in a groove and hold the mailbag 
-PRON- catch -PRON- this time and simultanrausly a catapult throw the mailbag forward in the direction of the plane travel so as to reduce the jerk on the dag 
a second attempt will be make on the next return trip of the leviathan this time when the ship be still mile at sea 
light and sound indicate altitude on plane a recent development of dr alexanderson of the general electric company pilot can new have a positive indication of -PRON- heit above the ground even though the weather may be so bad that -PRON- can not see the ground 
the device consist of send a radio impulse to the gnund from the plane and pick up the same impulse after -PRON- be reflect from the ground back to tbc plane 
the sound be pick up as a squeal 
whenever the airple change altitude by half a wavelength a whistle note go through a complete tone cycle 
by count the cycle of the tone -PRON- be possible to measure the altitude 
a meter read from to foot rive the pilot an opportunity to know accurately -PRON- altitude within those limit 
as the plane approach the ground the echo become strong 
a memory reader be connect with the meter by which the meter continue to hold the altitude reading and give off the same echo until the alritude be change

i this department -PRON- shall publish every month -PRON- opinion 
after all this be -PRON- magazine and -PRON- be edit for ou 
if -PRON- fall down on the choice of -PRON- story or if the editorial board kp up occasionally -PRON- be up to -PRON- to voice -PRON- opinion 
-PRON- make no difference whether -PRON- letter be complimentaryi critical or whether -PRON- contain a good oldfashione brickbat 
all of -PRON- letter as much as space will allow will be publish here for the bent of all 
due to the large influx of mail no communication to this department be answer individually unless 25c in stamp to cover time and postage be remit 
a pilot speak -PRON- mind erftter hark mr editor man to the squawk squk and squeal of a ptleit for a couple of year more or less foltowe -PRON- editorial endeavor with great satisfaction 
when see a notice to the effect that -PRON- be te edit an air stoiw affair however become convinced that -PRON- would slippea a cog at last 
well foxy old rascal that -PRON- arc what do -PRON- do but leave fly alone and stick to -PRON- own sphere 
futuristic -PRON- be and will always be and wise enough to know -PRON- tool with a copy of -PRON- first air wonder story before -PRON- i can find only the follow fallacy in -PRON- aviation news department -PRON- peak of a helicopter and explain that -PRON- be a airplane in the first jdace the helicopter be no airplane at all merely another type of aircraft 
in the second place -PRON- lift be derive from rotation of a set of two or more airfoil in the manner of a propeller with vertical thrust may say here that the helicopter be much farther from true birdlike flight than the airplane loasmuch as the latter do soar while the former docs not 
the trulv birdlike craft be know as tbc qmitbopter derivinir both lift and propulsion in the horizontal ane by up -PRON- wing 
the objection be of course the movement necessary in those member donot recall an instance of any omithopter success 
the belicopter have however be build and fly experimentally though i can not believe in -PRON- commercial practicability because motor failure must certainly result in a bad crash there be no wing to allow -PRON- to glide down in safety 
in the same department -PRON- have an article head tail spin cause most crash i be not really sure but believe that this should be most feiel crash have three friend cash in so far two in spin or the beginning of -PRON- and one otherwise also one to in and write off a ship without serious physical injury 
cn the other hand in the thirty day akme 
the three above cover two year or more none in this thirtyday lve know six ship to crash bemuse of motor trouble alone 
th however do not result in any injury to passenger or pilot in any way save of the old horsebide pocketbook 
the loss there run from forty per cent of the plane value to one complete washout 
same department head safety slot keep plane stabilize 
so far so good 
but when -PRON- call -PRON- a safety device from the standpoint of stability i want discussion 
what ir a stall 
a ship be 8talle when the wing no longer take sufficient effect to hold the ship in the air and the control donot nt enough traction so to speak to bold -PRON- steady and a very disagreeable sensation -PRON- be i assure -PRON- especially when one be close to the real estate 
now at this point the slotted wing take effect 
like a guardian angel so -PRON- exponent tell -PRON- -PRON- rise from -PRON- position in the leading edge due to lowering of pressure on -PRON- and pour a smooth stream ox air over the foil 
this aiin seal the partial vacuum on the top of the airfoil where about per oent of the lift occur and also on the aileron 
but what of the tailgroup the conbrol that save the bacon 
-PRON- -PRON- friend must grow very loose and flabby 
and when the speed get too low for the slot what 
if the ship flic okay how be -PRON- inexperienced pilot that this slot be to save to know when ne8 in trouble donot know but i imagine that when one of these soupedup ship spin -PRON- must be a mansize job to get go again 
this of course be due to lack of extra pressure on the rudder which be about the only thing that help when -PRON- go to wind np 
incidentally i believe in the slotted wing becanse of the safety -PRON- give when one must land in a cottonpatch about the size of bis ship plus ten fret 
if the above objection can be answer aimreciate some expert do so 
unlike most pilot of -PRON- class do not fly in the war and i donot know all there be to the business 
in fact i freely admit that i have only something over eighty hour and have recently flunk a limited commercial flight test reliable information on the slotted wing be not very plentiful just now and certainly be not break out with -PRON- enjoy island in the air by mr morrow very much but canot really see the advantage of those same island 
personally always have a mania for nice solid air to land in 
-PRON- colonel lindbergh have -PRON- a lovely time not so long ago at mexico city or that vicinity on this account 
-PRON- lose a wheel in take off 
now here in sunny texas altitude at dalla foot -PRON- job would have land at some or mile per hour 
-PRON- say a little of bis dexterous manipulation probably a judiciously time ground loop would have put -PRON- down without further damage 
but at about foot tkot be another stool -PRON- guess be that be come in at about or maybe even more 
result nobody be hurt much due to bis usual coolness and attention to detail but -PRON- didnot fly that ship again soon 
all of which somewhat beside the question 
the idea be though that the good effect of the slotted wing mention above would just about be nullify by the necessity of land at an altitude of a few thousand foot 
but to have do with -PRON- hairsplitting and et cetera i want to say that to -PRON- mind -PRON- new magazine be a grand success 
-PRON- doesnot aspire to tell of the brave deed and dauntless courage rarely do or possess by the present day nut twister and jcnnjrherder like -PRON- usually roaktni -PRON- ridiculous and bolster weak plot with weak side issue that give -PRON- a name like travel salesman but go into the future give -PRON- some mighty fine reading and who know how many bright idea 
keep up the good work an donot mind ray kick a little 
i kick mv chum regularly once a week and tell -PRON- -PRON- s a bounder a bum a cad a derelict on the sea of life and no earthly use to anyone 
i think -PRON- get mad at -PRON- and take -PRON- out on -PRON- woik not speak of any one toi in the way of praise because the blame thing be too good for -PRON- ta say which i like bestl hangar no 
love field dallas texas 
-PRON- be very glad to get such a critical and wellthought out letter from an experienced pilot 
get the aviation news from the various paper and journal devote to the art -PRON- do not question the technical efficienev oi the device write about 
rather -PRON- allow as in this case -PRON- reader to state -PRON- opinion on -PRON- 
regard the safety slot -PRON- believe that the company frankly admit that the use of -PRON- reduce somewoat the pilot ability to maneuver the plane 
but the british government think so well of -PRON- that -PRON- buy -PRON- for no less than anyway -PRON- find mr letter a very interesting one and invite -PRON- to send -PRON- another when the mood strike -PRON- 
however there may be some pilot among -PRON- reader who do not agree with mr greding 
-PRON- column arc open to -PRON- editor 
like the whole blame magazine editor have be an ardent reader of sciencb wonder story when the latter sister magazine 
air wonder story be announce i await -PRON- advent with a good deal of pleasure 
see -PRON- on the newsstand i purchase -PRON- and -PRON- come in all way up to -PRON- expectation 
-PRON- be much like -PRON- sister magazine 
i like the cover 
i do not have to refer to the table of content to see what the story be that -PRON- illustrate 
the symbol of a propeller be also very appropriate 
and there be no one hke hugo 
jernsback to write interesting editorial and now for the story bad read the ark of the covenant before and have fry to reread -PRON- but have not succeed until -PRON- appear in air wonder story 
-PRON- be a darn good story 
island in the air be also good 
the cover design make -PRON- suspect that -PRON- be a lot of technical bunk but -PRON- wasnot 
the beacon of airport ven bad -PRON- all mix up and i still donot know why the wherefore be which 
however -PRON- be tell in an excrilent manner 
i like the bloodless war naturally as -PRON- be by keller 
man with wing be splendid 
all hail to les stone 
by the zoay turn old be hef -PRON- didn look verv old in the riioto go to send for those six scientiflctionen as as possible 
i like the idea of a science library 
in fact 
i have one already 
war the air head publish -PRON- soon 
the aviation news be too technical for -PRON- bot like be there even though i didnot read -PRON- 
and that s about all 
i like the cover like the bind the paper conld be well i like the whole blame magazine 
and i want to say if -PRON- donot stop put out so many magazine go bankrupt for i always toy -PRON- homnir thou i yonra for big and well air wonder san francisco 
the editor have a complaint 
mr kuttneria letter be another one of thone whh nothing but praise for air wonder storizs 
the reader have well beware 
-PRON- io nothing jaore fatal to the editorial cranaum than an excessive swelling induce by a surfeit of praise 
leslie stone author of man with wing -PRON- wish to state js not a -PRON- but a -PRON- 
and inasmuch as -PRON- be a young and comely -PRON- mr error the point in the beacon of airport seven be that the professor have bt the light ray from the beacon so that the beacon light really appear to come from a place other than -PRON- real source 
the pilot of course not know this would either misjudge -PRON- height above the ground or -PRON- latitude or longitude and would either crash into the ground or go far off -PRON- course 
this story by the way be one of the good of -PRON- kind that be find two mistake editor i have just finish read -PRON- first issue of air wonder story and have enjoy -PRON- more than any other of -PRON- publication 
yes 
-PRON- other magazine be good but this magazine seem a little well 
i like the idea of put in the aviation news of the month drawing be very good hut on the cover where -PRON- picture tnc island of the air there seem to be two mistake 
one be that the shadow of the tower on the island nearest the top fall in a different direction than any of the other 
the other be that the thing on the island that show which way the wind be blow so that airplane know from which direction to land be point in the opposite direction of that in the smoke be go down on the ground 
i want to thank -PRON- for the enjoyment -PRON- have give -PRON- and hope every issue will be as good as -PRON- first 
mihraukec 
wise 
the editor cheerfully admit the justice of mr criticism of the two error on the cover design for the first issue of air wonder story 
as mr kauper -PRON- understand be only -PRON- must congratulate -PRON- on -PRON- keenness of perception as well as concentration on the detail of the drawing 
-PRON- arc always happy to receive such criticism 
in fact the editor be become worried about -PRON- mental state 
the letter receive be almost uniformly fill with word of congratulation and praise 
-PRON- often sigh on finish a letter to find not a bit of criticism no oldfshione brickbat that stir -PRON- on page 
conliwte jrom page 
continue from page dirigibe for meteorological study xact study of meteorological condition as well as certain radio effect will be afford the massachusetts institute of technology by the loan of the dirigible mayflow for the summer observation station at south dartmoutht mass by the company 
the study of radio wave will take place by have the ship remain atwve the antennae and measure the energry radiate from the station 
there will be measurement of the size and thickness of fog and general weather study impossible on the ground or on plane the latter because of the inability of tbe plane to remain stationery 
eventually -PRON- be hope that a relar weather service can be establish and forecast broadcast 
diesel engine look good say curtiss executive president of the curtiss aero plane and motor company see interesting possibility in the diesel motor for aircraft and -PRON- company be continue -PRON- experiment of the last few year on -PRON- 
with a lessened fire risk than the ordinary gasoline engine and afford well operation of the plane radio the diesel engine accord to mr key secs definite advantage 
the lower cost of fuel which the diesel engine also show be not believe by mr key to be important as -PRON- say the fuel cost on one line the transcontinental air transport be only cent a mile where as the total cost of operation be cent a mile 
other aircraft executive disagree with mr key however and do not believe tbe diesel promise much 
steam turbine propose for large plane ecause of the prohibitive weight of gasoline engine when use for plane have a great power the possibility of use tbe team turbine have be open accord to ljungstrom steam turbine company of stockholm 
-PRON- be now prepare specification for an american plane which be to have a power of to horsepower 
there would le a high pressure boiler feed with crude oil the boiler to supply steam for two turbine 
a turbine weight as low as two pound horsepower as be reach 
the use of this method would permit of slow propeller speed 
the steam after be use would be expose to large cool surface on the wing of the plane for condensation 
although the weight of fuel would be great than on the gasoline engine the cost would be less 
unsafe plane have perfect safety record year ago the type navy fly boat be brand as be unsafe and navy flier be warn not to stunt in -PRON- 
-PRON- be to be use only on the routine cruising and patrolling work 
whether because of this or in spite of -PRON- a recent tabulation of the record of that type of craft show fly hour cover mile without a single fatality 
aviation expert review a recent wave of fatal plane accident have be force to come to the conclusion that safe plane remote recklessness on the part of pilot and cnee accident while the dangerous plane be so carefully handle that -PRON- become safe 
twenty mile an hour add to army plane -PRON- use of a chemical to cool the curtiss hawk airplane engine use by the army as pursuit ship have introduce the possibility of great saving in weight and afford great increase in the speed of ship accord to brie 
general william gilmore 
the ship ne a much small radiator surface and thus the wingskin radiator have be use with a great reduction in tbe parasitic resistance 
there have also be a great saving in weight as little water be need and thus more military equipment can be carry or more pay load if the ship be use for commercial traffic 
the chemisal use be ethyleneglycol mention in these column previously 
editor 
lunch hour discussion editor although just out of -PRON- sophomore year at high school i think -PRON- may interest -PRON- to know what an effect and reaction boy and girl of -PRON- age have to -PRON- magazine 
at present i be go to the telegraph school at western union and have find to -PRON- immense pleasure that fully per cent of the student read -PRON- magazine and have read tbe one -PRON- edit formerly before -PRON- start science and aib wondbk story magazine 
in each case -PRON- have the opinion that -PRON- magazine be a per cent improvement over tbe old 
during lunch -PRON- have very interesting and animate discussion over the different feature of the story and often very ingenious and plausible theory arc advance in regard to future event and to explain some thing -PRON- do not understand 
last fall i enter high school two month late and sie up physics as one of -PRON- subject 
have lose nearly onequarter of the school year -PRON- ordinarily would have be very difficult for -PRON- to catch up but because i have read -PRON- editorial since i be about year old i have no difficulty in take up physics at that time and catch up with -PRON- work 
all this because of the scientific knowledge i have absorb 
the alien intelligence be a wonderful story have more like -PRON- 
the radium pool bid fair to be a classic second only to the moon pool 
the moon beast be rather farfetched 
i havenot finish the feminine metamorphosis yet so will withhold -PRON- opinion 
the eternal man be good but let have a secret ending of the poor professor 
in air wonder story man with wing be the good write with island in the air a close second 
i wonot decide yet about the ark of the covenant 
-PRON- science and aviation news department alone be worth the price of the magazine have more story by stone and the writer of the visitation and how about another cover contest 
by the way there have be quite an argument about leslie stone 
some contend -PRON- be a girl other -PRON- be a ixiy 
at any rate bet leslie be rather young 
please give -PRON- all the information -PRON- can address age and sex 
personally i think -PRON- be a boy and about or year old from the picture to great and well science wonder story and air wonder story 
salt lake city utah 
leslie stone be a young woman of -PRON- should judge twentytwo 
-PRON- be glad to get the insight into the effect of -PRON- story on -PRON- reader 
the description of mr petersen help to fill in the background of the glimpse -PRON- be try to get of -PRON- reader group 
editor want sequel to air master editor congratulation -PRON- have make another hit 
i have just finish read -PRON- second issue of the air wonder story and -PRON- almost as good as -PRON- sister magazine 
i be an ardent reader of both 
first let -PRON- say a word or two about that incomparable story the ark of the covenant 
in ray opinion -PRON- be the good air story -PRON- will ever publish in -PRON- magazine 
i be read -PRON- over for tbe fourth time and i still get that same old kick from -PRON- 
another story i think be very good be gravity by earl repp 
give -PRON- some more from -PRON- 
the air master be another one that make -PRON- blood tingle as -PRON- read -PRON- the author give -PRON- a sequel 
i really think one be due 
there be one story i didnot like 
-PRON- be island in the air 
the science be good but the plot be that same old thing where the villain come back and steal the plan of the invention 
now donot give -PRON- any more of that stuff 
that be one thing like about the ark of the covenant 
there be no sneak villain to steal the plan of the new airship tbe merlin 
i think one of the good thing about -PRON- magazine be the wonderful illustration -PRON- mr paul 
-PRON- be without question the good artist that -PRON- could secure tor that kind of work 
i admit that some of earthman be not quite perfect but when to come to draw man from other planet and huge fantastic drawing of machinery and laboratory paul have -PRON- all skin a mile 
i think one or two more illustration wouldnot hurt the magazine 
5ne more brickbat and sign off 
please for gosh sake print on a well grade paper 
-PRON- will not only help the appearance but -PRON- will reduce tbe size 
tbe idea of print the author portrait along with -PRON- story be a good one 
keep -PRON- up 
charlotte 
as if make to order a sequel to the air master by edward cbappelow be already in -PRON- hand 
-PRON- believe -PRON- be well than the original story 
-PRON- will probably appear in the november issue 
-PRON- be surprise that mr pitt do not like island in tbe air as -PRON- consider -PRON- a very good story 
although -PRON- may seem a version of the old villain theme still the fact of -PRON- every day life show that mr morrow have not overstate the case 
anyone readtnp a life of alexander graham beil will realize bow frequently man be cheat of tbe reward of -PRON- invention by such man as mr morrow describe 
editor 
want humorous aviation story editor i have receive two copy of air wonder storrie so far and both be very good 
i would like to know whether -PRON- be go to have a quarterly or annual 
in the august issue the silent destroyer be very good but a little too short 
the ark of the covenant be also very good 
i agree with albert taylor in that -PRON- ought to have a humorous aviation story once in a while 
i would like to know what a kilometer and a kilo be in american measure 
chicago 
-PRON- feel a little proud in be able to fill -PRON- reader need almost as -PRON- appear 
suitcase airplane be an aviation story write in a humorous vein by a newlyfound writer of fine ability 
-PRON- can not yet divulge fais name 
but bis story will appear shortly 
a kilometer be about fiveeight ot -PRON- mile a kilo gram be poundsdt7or question nordic superiority editor i have just finish the story man with wing and have come to tbe conclusion that as a writer of scientific story stone will make a good school teacher 
the story be almost improbable 
in tbe first place -PRON- know that every invention or scientific theory be base on something that have go before 
how be -PRON- possible that year ago a man do such wonderful thing as a gland transformation especially from a bird 
where would -PRON- place this gland as there be no place in the human body that could use a gland that be absolutely useless to -PRON- 
next the mentorite would not be the perfect being that -PRON- describe -PRON- as -PRON- seem to roe -PRON- shoulder would broaden considerably and -PRON- would gradually develop into bird 
if man ever do develop wing -PRON- will be more like the wing of hat stretch from the hand to tbe foot 
man will have to undergo grreat body change if this be to come about donot see how this would help -PRON- express -PRON- soul desire or whatever -PRON- say -PRON- language be entirely too flowery 
-PRON- would seem like cveryday life to the person with wing 
next i be anglosaxon and celtic and donot intend to be call a nordic or class with scandinavian yust come over 
the celt and saxon be usually as dark as the french and be a mixture of northern and southern blood and therefore can not be call nordic -PRON- realize what a flimsy thing any race lino as all man be a mixture 
nor be there anything as race superiority as where one nun fall down the next be up 
now for something nice to say 
every story except man with wing be good and i wish -PRON- good luck on -PRON- new publication 
minneapolis minn 
mr idea about man with wing be well take 
there would undoubtedly have to be a scat for the wing to grow 
but what mentor do be to hasten the evolution that may have take thousand of year 
all quality be transmit through the blood and what mentor do be to instill those quality and allow -PRON- to develop through the generation 
-PRON- feel too that race superiority be not altogether well found 
race decay and vanish or flourish depend on a great many factor one of which be psychical editor

ala wonder story should be purely a fiction magazine 
such department as the new one and aviation news of tbe month will spoil -PRON- 
what -PRON- publish in aviation news of the month be not tbe late news 
the late news can be obtain in any of tbe aviation or scientific mazine on the newsstand 
the second irt of the ark of tbe covenant by victor be even well than tbe first 
the air master by edward chappelow take second place and the silent destroyer hy henrick dahl juve third 
the cover picture be the good yet 
chicago -PRON- be happy to get frank expression of opinion on the pcflicy of air wonder story such as be contain in this letter 
after all -PRON- can only get an index of -PRON- reader desire through such expression 
-PRON- invite -PRON- reader to give -PRON- -PRON- opinion on this subject 
editor 
from one of -PRON- author editor thank -PRON- for the copy of each of -PRON- magazine which -PRON- have recently send -PRON- 
i have subscribe for air wonder story which i be surprised to find not too different from science wonder story 
in view of the enormous interest in aviation the magazine should enjoy a good circulation and attract mai new writer and i feel that -PRON- win do so 
personally though the scope be narrow and more limited as well as more technical and for these reason do not interest -PRON- quite so much as a field for -PRON- writing 
i have enjoy the apparent hmitlessness of the for general scientifiction 
-PRON- unique opportunity for originality 
this may be wholly a feminine point of view for generally speak i think more people be mtereste in tbe future of aviation th -PRON- be in a diversity of scientific possibility 
-PRON- be probably a matter of taste and with -PRON- two excellent magazine -PRON- win attract both 
lakewood omo 
-PRON- print this letter from mrs harris one of -PRON- good sciencefiction author to indicate -PRON- opinion a correct one of the general interest in the future of aviation 
-PRON- hope for the sake of -PRON- reader to induce mrs harris to contribute to aia wonder story 
editor 
will revolutionize air story field editor after read -PRON- first edition i can assure -PRON- that -PRON- make a great hit with -PRON- as well as with all -PRON- friend who have join -PRON- in read this wonderful magazine which believe tvill revolutionize the entire air story field 
have be keenly interested in tbe rapid progress of aviation tbe past i can readily see the dossibllitie and viewpoint which -PRON- author have 
this be especially true in bloodless war by david keller 
i actually believe that future war will be fight exactly this way or in way similar to -PRON- 
but -PRON- certainly be true that -PRON- will have radiocontrolle shi in the near future have more of dr story 
the ark of the covenant by victor be a wonderful story though in -PRON- opinion a bit farfetched as far as completely stop all transportation as well as put -PRON- victim in a coma be concerned think -PRON- have carry -PRON- a bit too far 
of course i have read only tbe first installment and there be probably some big surprise in store for -PRON- in next month installment grand rapid mich 
-PRON- can agree heartily with mr driswl on the forccfulncs of dr presentation of a possible war to be fight from the air 
gener mitchcl formerly commander of -PRON- air force have show convincingly that the airplane in the next war will be tbe most powerful weapon of offense and because -PRON- can descend on an enemy practically without warning will constitute a most terrible weapon

continue from page little doubt that the next war will be win from the air and probably with a suddenness that will stagger the defeat 
by this time mr driscol will probably have read the second and third installment of the ark of the covenant and -PRON- will have perceive that the power give to the raider be not a bit farfetched 
the condition be so possible of realization that a civilization not adequately protect from the enemy within -PRON- border as well as from those from without may well tremble 
editor 
cite peril of foreign domination editor i have just recently finish read -PRON- air wonder story and i be write this to congratulate -PRON- upon this splendid piece of work no sooner have finish -PRON- than -PRON- be borrow and from that time -PRON- have go the round 
i be unable to say or guess how many person eagerly peruse this remarkable magazine 
besides -PRON- a number have intimate to -PRON- that the ark of the covenant promise to be one of the good story -PRON- have ever read 
as -PRON- say editorially the author victor be a past master at the art of writing as i have see few story which in -PRON- opinion have approximate this story in suspense interest style and literal construction 
island in the air the beacon of airport seven and man wing be every one most excellent story hard to beat 
i eecially want to commend dr the bloodless war 
this graphically bring home -PRON- imminent peril of foreign domination 
to a great extent the next war will be fight in the air and william mitchell have conclusively prove that the united state be absolutely unable to defend -PRON- in the air 
in the bloodless war dr keller show what will soon happen to -PRON- unless -PRON- snap out of -PRON- 
yes sir i reiterate 
-PRON- have produce a fine magazine and as several have say -PRON- bid fair to lead science wonder story in popular esteem 
how about an air wonder quarterly 
hobart okla 
this letter of mr wardner be another of the flood of letter of congratulation that have reach the editor 
as -PRON- have indicate on mr letter the nation that control the air may well control the world 
an enlighten public opinion with a full knowledge of the fact be what be need 
one can not afford to look backward to or for a glimpse of what future warfare will be like 
an announcement regard the possibility of an air wonder quarterly will probably be make in the near future 
no interplanetarian story be contemplate at present for air wonder story 
-PRON- be believe by the editor that air wonder story should concern -PRON- with terrestrial aviation for that field really embrace a wide and thrilling field of play for the imagination of writer and reader alike 
however -PRON- cordially invite the criticism of -PRON- reader on the editorial policy of air wonder story -PRON- must please -PRON- reader edifor 
want two more magazine editor i have just read -PRON- late magazine aiu wonder story and find -PRON- exllent 
i must also congratulate -PRON- on get frank paul as -PRON- art director 
i think most of -PRON- drawing be superb 
island in the air be the lst story i think 
next to -PRON- i would rank the story the bloodless war 
i do not like -PRON- first installment of the ark of the covenant by victor i have follow mr gemsback through -PRON- career and i think that -PRON- be fully capable of put two more great sciencefiction magazine on the market 
i wish -PRON- could persuade schlossel to writ a sequel to -PRON- story which appear in -PRON- former magazine 
the second swarm be the title of -PRON- 
i have read nothing to equal this or do i think i ever will if mr schlossel docs not give -PRON- a sequel 
minneapolis minn 
-PRON- be not sure whether -PRON- understand mr scammon aright when -PRON- say -PRON- be capable of put out two more sciencefiction magazine 
do -PRON- mean two in addition to air wonder story and science wonder story 
if so -PRON- feel mightily tell -PRON- truthfully mr scammon do -PRON- really mean two more edyor 
wait for the next issue editor recently purchase a copy should sa the first copy of air wonder story have read -PRON- from cover to cover and enjoy -PRON- immensely 
the only thing i can find against -PRON- be that i wonot know what to do until the next issue come out 
the sketch of the author on the first page of every story be a very fine idea 
keep -PRON- up 
give -PRON- more story by leslie stone 
-PRON- man wth wing be fine 
victor new serial sure keep -PRON- in expectation 
morrow and syke be also very good 
david keller be fairly good but for goodness sake donot overwork -PRON- 
i find many interesting item in aviation news 
if -PRON- keep up the good work i donot think i will ever nave any complaint 
cincinnati ohio 
somehow the editor have an impish desire to do something that will cause a complaint 
-PRON- just isnot right that -PRON- should not receive some 
harden and matured as -PRON- be to brickbat like the krazy kat of wellknown association -PRON- be rather lonesome without -PRON- 
however -PRON- be over appreciative of the good thing that be say about -PRON- editor 
have there be wing man 
editor want to compliment -PRON- on -PRON- new magazine as there be some very fine science in -PRON- and make very good reading matter 
-PRON- man with wing by leslie stone in the july issue be certainly a wonderful story and furnish very good food for thought be a reader of -PRON- former magazine 
i be only twelve and of course have a very limited knowledge of science but i like science story and be very interested in science 
have what have cleverly be think of in man with wing ever be really try by scientist 
i suppose not but i be just wonder 
amesburg mass 
as far as -PRON- knowledge go there have never be an experiment with man to give -PRON- real wing 
there be of course the fabled story of man wear artificial wing and fly through the air 
such a one be that of icarus whose father daedalus fit -PRON- with wing and -PRON- both fly across the aegean sea 
but icarus wish to fly nearer the sun than -PRON- father dare rise high into the air 
but the sun melt the wax that hold the wing on -PRON- and -PRON- fall into the sea 
some day either what miss stone prophesy will come true man will be endow with wing or there will be develop artificial wing that -PRON- can remove when and as -PRON- wish 
possibly wing that -PRON- be force to wear all the time may constitute something of a handicap to -PRON- 
but there be no reason why something picture for example in flight in in this issue should not come to pass 
as bruce gould so truly say in -PRON- new book skylarking review in this issue the desire of man to fly have always be with -PRON- as a deepseate spiritual need 
the picture of people stand with arm outstretche toward the sky be a real and vivid one 
perhaps in age long go by man once have wing 
and even though million of year have pass be chain to the earth have never satisfy -PRON- 
down through the age have trickle that stream of blood from -PRON- fly ancestor whether a fly reptile fly lizard or what not 
and the sight of people fly only serve to awaken that primordial instinct 
this of course be only an hypothesis but -PRON- have much to sustain -PRON- 
editor 
from an associate editor editor i have receive -PRON- magazine and be tremendously interested in the story 
i have one boy of sixteen year of age and when science wonder story and air wonder story come aljout a dozen boy of the neighborhood gather in

the sustain force on the airplane be principally due to a partial vacuum on the top side of the wing 
at high angle of attack about seventyfive per cent of the lift on the wing be due to the vacuum on the top of the wing

new regulation for transport pilot rom a survey of the accident on airplane during result in the conclusion that the human equation be responsible for about half the accident and per cent of the total be due to the poor technique of pilot new and strict regulation for transport pilot will put into effect on september 1st this be the statement of edward howard chief of the air regulation division of the department of commerce by transport pilot be mean those who pilot commercial plane or plane over a certain weight 
the new regulation will allow transport pilot to only the type of plane -PRON- be license for 
to fly any other new examination must be take 
three class of plane will be list 
the first be those weigh not more than pound the second include weight of to pound and the third over pound 
all license will be revise after september 1st and -PRON- be expte that safety in the air will be materially increase 
development of safety great need -PRON- development of great safety in aviation be the industrys great need declare john northrop chief engineer avion corporation as tell to rochlen in the new york american 
fog and fire be the two most deadly menace which must be overcome 
-PRON- believe that -PRON- be gradually eliminate these danger 
the elimination of fire will come from the use of engine and fuel especially design for that purpose 
in this connection the diesel engine be note 
aside from -PRON- low operating st -PRON- use a nonexplosive crude oil and have -PRON- iwer system so that fire be practically impossible 
plane of tomorrowj -PRON- say will power by slim nigged diesel place out of the way of parasitic drag and bead resistance 
the need for pilot to know -PRON- altitude above the ground rather than that above sea level have give rise to the development of new altitude meter one of which nas be develop b the genera 
electric company 
such a meter be invaluable while the pilot fly in a fog 
the use of radio beacon will not only guide the pilot through fog and give -PRON- landmark but with automatic stabilizer will keep -PRON- on bis course telephone conversation already carry out between a plane foot up and the ground promise well for keep the pilot in touch with what be go on on page company assist fly club formation nthuse by the reception that the fly club idea have be give by the country the swallow airplane company have engage -PRON- research department on the task of form club 
a set of bylaw for use by club have be draw up and be available through the company 
the club be to be know as the swallow fly club of the city in which -PRON- be form 
the company be locate in wichita kansa 
the idea of the club be to allow people who have not the time or money to go to an air center to learn fly to do so at -PRON- own home city at time convenient to wage earner 
lure of aviation strong to youth igure show the number of applicant for pilot8 license and student license indicate the lure of aviation to the youth of the country say jesse lankford chief of the licensing bureau of the department of commerce accord to a new york time despatch 
one of the great impulse toward aviation be give by col paris flight 
the whole aviation industry have be give suclk an impetus and the need for train flyer have grow so that a pilot can easily command a salary of a year today

what be safe method of travel i an attempt to discover just how safe the airplane be as a method of travel the washington star have collect figure on accident by train automobile and airplane for the year as a result of the operation of railroad one person be kill for every mile travel 
there be one fatality for every mile travel by plane while the automobile account for only one death in mile of travel 
but the death do not indicate the full extent of the risk 
every fatality on train carry with -PRON- accident not fatal for every death by plane there be hardly two injury while accompany every automobile death there be person injure 
while the automobile apparently be safe than either of the other two -PRON- margin of safety be not great while the risk of travel by auto be increase rapidly with the grow congestion 
navy aid commercial aviation say ingall rom the experience of the world war and take an enlightened view of the future the navy department be do all in -PRON- jpower to aid commercial aviation say david ingall assistant secretary of the navy for aeronautics 
since the armed force of the country can not be great enough either in man or uipment for cither an offensive or defensive war there must cxist some reserve which can be call upon 
this be the text of one of the reason why commercial aviation should be aid 
the navy department be share with the air company the improvement that -PRON- make in plane and plane equipment 
-PRON- be no longer compete with the commercial company in any wajr -PRON- offer advice and maintain research division hope that a great number of train pilot and a number of jplane convertible to national use may be available

-PRON- therefore take on with some grace the post of apostle and exponent of the new art of aviation 
for art -PRON- be accord to mr gould 
there be to nothing in -PRON- book that smack of the carrying of beef or cheese or dry good 
aviation to -PRON- be principally a thrilling experience that the god have put into the lap of man 
and man use -PRON- to swing through the starry weight of night or straight into the blazing orb of tte sun laugh -PRON- defiance of those god be therefore a symphony on the joy of fly 
-PRON- be write with the author strain to the utmost to catch all fleeting shade of mean that a trip through terrestrial space allow 
perhaps -PRON- overdo -PRON- coloring so that the reader feel hnally a sensation of surfeit 
but if that be true mr gould probably err on the side of too much enthusiasm rather than too little sincerity 
the lxok be not wholly take up with the paean of joy at man ability to fly 
several chapter be devoted to the history of fly d of the great flight of the past ten year 
the reason for the success or failure of each analyze with a striking impartiality

the author begin at the beginning by illustrate the simple maneuver of the plane the use of the elevator aileron and dder take the reader for a theoretical ride the author indicate how the control should be apply in each case and the practical complexity that attend the use of the control 
the author wish to make an art a practical art of the business of fly 
therefore each possible situation in take off maneuvering and landing receive -PRON- attention 
interwte psychologically be the method of ulustrate a point by a picture in which the reader actually see -PRON- in the plane and behind the control 
this should help somewhat to give a student the feel of be the pilot of the plane

-PRON- must therefore grant -PRON- the qualification to write authoritatively on the principle of aviation 
element of aviation seem design to provide basm understanding of the principle of flight 
through a study of the effect of air flow on the airfoil of a plane -PRON- learn the aerynamio principle that operate the plane 
for one who wish really to fly too much can not be learn about the elusive and often temperamental factor that govern flight ror be base on such a fluid and evermove thing as air flight require a knowledge of the physical law that govern the air 
particularly interesting be the chapter on the wrth atmosphere 
here the extent and quality oi the atmosphere the ceiling etc be analyze and explain both from a mathematical and a general point of view 
the possibility of high speed at high altitude now seriously engage the attention of aeronautical expat consider subject in the book receive a careful mathematical treatment and therefore -PRON- be of special interest to those who wish the quantitative and not merely the qualitative elementa of the flight problem from page what be ae roll and immelman tear

also what be a roll 
wilmington del 
the immelman turn invent by capt immelman one of the great german ace during the late war be a combination of inside loop and a roll 
the pilot pull the stick fully back so that the elevator rise and turn the lane over on -PRON- back 
at the same time -PRON- wer the aileron on one side and raise -PRON- on the other so that the ple turn over on -PRON- side 
tbe opposite be often find in diving when a diver will jump into the air execute a half somersault and then before -PRON- reach the water twist over on -PRON- side

correct too editor aviation fomm often hear -PRON- say that landing be one of the most difficult part of pilot a plan 
i have often wonder just what a pilot could do if be be glide to earth at too steep an angle and when near the ground suddenly discover -PRON- error 
could -PRON- save bireself and -PRON- ship 
i would appreciate an answer to this espwially in diagram form if -PRON- do find space for one 
kansas city 
mo 
such a predicament as mr brown describe be one that would call for a great deal of steep landing skill 
if -PRON- assume that -PRON- come out of the flide at say twenty foot from the ground the two diagram show would indicate what would happen in two contingency 
if after come out of the glide the craft head upward again and the pilot do not correct this -PRON- will find that the plane will stall on the upward climb and -PRON- will probably pancake to earth as show in the upper figure 
if however -PRON- depress the nose of the craft after come out of the glide while -PRON- still have fiye speed -PRON- can continue the glide to earth at a smooth angle tn before and make a safe bl imi utn tocbtot iwild 20feet ground level too fast wkal pilot do ukk te lb mtaf ad cairy otf a nomul wrong and right way to correct a glide which be at too steep an angle with the ground
