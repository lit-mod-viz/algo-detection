also send priestess of miirdeif bij artkur leo zagat author of death lives at our house etc a thin of terror lurked in hiding waiting to work its ghastly evil upon heautiful leila was her lover in truth the monster who sought herf was it lovely eve her best friend
or were darkest suspicions could it he that she herself changed periodically into the thing of horror and death that haunted that stricken countryside he house was full of whispers
mooroy small iu the huge easy chair fumbled at her throat
a sob was trying to rise there knotting her musdes with a sort of phjracal pain
the house was ftdl of whispers
the ancient fannliouse that always had been her home was an abo of brooding dread a place of dark despair
the groaning of the old timbers drying fibers seemed terribly loud in the oppressive silence
they came from the very walls about leila from the agedarkened rafters overhead from the ominous gloom of the entrance hallway that somehow repelled tlie livingroom hffht from the broad staircase a daringly differeni long fovel of eerie mystery and weird unholy passiim twisting upward out of that foyer to appallingly empty obscurity above
the house was full of whispers shredding frayed nerves with terrible reminders of her days long agony
just such a place of muted ominous sounds had the courtroom been
unshed tears through the anguished hours had blurred its crowded benches and the only reality had been the gaunt suffering figure of her greyfaced father in the prisoners dock
but the whispers had been inescapable
all day they had hissed at her as they were hissing now mutterings of horror as witness after witness had damned justin monroy with husked tales of brutal unutterably savage killing gasps of outrage when leila herself gave halting testimony that she had been with her father here in this room all the fatal hour between the time when shean rourke had last been seen alive and the time when foster corbett had found his hacked and mangled corpse beneath the poplars dividing the two farms
whispers had met the exhausted girl whispers of tightlipped condemnation when at last she had stumbled down from the witness chair and the sunday silks had rustled selfrighteously drawing away from the defiling touch of the girl who hostile eyes said had lied desperately to save a bloodguilty slayer
whispers whispers whispers seething out of the pulsating silence as the stonyfaced jury marched back into their box
and then the whispers had become a soundless scream searing breast as the dreadful verdict soughed from the foremans tight throat
murder
while insane insane
the recollection flung leila monroy up out of her chair held her rigid in distress
insane the word hissed within her skull hissed from the stark vacancy in which she was so utterly alone with terror and despair
slithering foliage stirred by a swiftly rising wind hissed it at her from the terrible outer night
insane insane i the kindly tender old man to whose gnarled hand she had clung as the brown clods thudded on the drab wood of her mothers coffin the hardworking weatherbeaten oldster who had been father and mother to her through so many years a madman
her father
from whose veins came the blood surging now so darkly in her veins
leila quivered
tremors ran through the long delicate curves of her slim form
the tiny oval of her smallfeatured countenance blanched with a new dismay
his blood in her veins
what if that blood were tainted with a foul lust to kill with an stavistic urge to tear with fang and claw to rend human flesh and taste the warm saltsweet tang of human lifefluid on smacking gory lips
what if she had not really drowsed that halthour whose lapse fatally had invalidated her testimony
had she run instead ravening by his side while a fearful heritage of homicidal madness blotted memory from her soul as the alienists said it had blotted recollection from justin a the light within was paled by a blue blaze glaring in through the window on which her unseeing stare was fixed by lightning that split the skys black vault with a jagged and blazing fracture
thunder blast became to the shocked girl the devastating roar of an enormous beast that leaped on the house that battered it that shook it in huge jaws whose slaver was driving rain
storm tumult howled about the old walls crashed through the empty rooms drowned out tlw whispers that had tortured leila drowned out the whispers in her harried brain
almost after the first terrific onslaut she was grateful for the fury li that woid4 o loiter let her hear those whispei5
but it could not drown her dreadful thoughts
np she moaned
merciful lord no as she had mcned when justin suave attorney had elicited from the baldpated alienist glib testimony that had saved his client from the deathchair and condemned him to a living hell
nol it be true ootdd have done nothing else the lawyer lad answered her reproaches afterward
it was your fathers ax foster corbett found buried in the dead mans chest
ypuf fathers footprints were traced ottt of the trampled mess around the corpse surf across the meadow to your back porch
there was the old boundary line feud between your father and his neighbor his threats that if foster corbett or his oon stanley or his farm hand shean rourice stejed on monroy land they would regret it
against that we had only your won that he was seated in the rown with you all evening
and on crossexamination you admitted that you had fallen asteep
the wind pounded against the door as their fists had pounded coming to accuse dad of the awful deed
foster corbett triumphant at last over his ancient adversary
stan corbett pale lips writhed
stanl in his arms she had known happmess against her lips his lips had thrilled
defiant of the enmity between their fathers they had loved
if state trooper stanley corbett had fired his gun into her heart he could no more cruelly have slain that love than he had by sayir to her father under arrest mr monroy
rain lashed against the window in a spasm of new fury
the world was ablaze with a flickering dectric flare that spilled bluely on the tossing poplars marching along the treemarked boundary between the two farms
it was ju there that shean corpse somethii moved stealthily vague and black among the windbent trunks darkness smashed down again
who was it
who prowled the stormdrenched night
the demoniac slayer who had made a ghastly horror of what once had been a man
the tea killer stalking a new prey
stalking her
icy fingers clutched leila throat chill priddes tickled her spine
hi bloodthirst still unslaked inflamed by bis terrible crime for which dad unjustly had been condemned to terrible expiation the murderer was creeping up on her
on her an ancient legend of whispered terror trailed a slimy speculation across her fear
a name breathed with shudders of apprehension by the gaffers clustering around the cberrybellied stove in the village
the monster of west cliff
the traditional phantom that was reputed to haunt the stony precipice whose sheer rampart rose behind the fertile plain along which from north to south lay the three neighboring farms of the corbetts the monroys and the stars
often of late he had bear seen stalking the dark belt of primeval forest cloaking the base of th cliff the elusive appalling wraith it was said of an indian chief whose tribe had been massacred by the plains first settlers
stalking the ages waiting for a chance at gruesome revaige
every accident every unexplained disaster of the countryside was ascribed to him
was it he who arched the heavens once more exploding into momentary existence the tempesttormented trees the downpourbeaten pasture between
they were deserted vacant as the house itself
nothing no one was anywhere in sight
the prowling shadow had been an illusion a figment of her anguished wait
the iituned sight had recalled something to leila
an incident of the fateful night that she had utterly forgotten till now till it was too late
the girl groaned beat her breast in bitter selfcondemnation
stepping to this very window that evening to pull down its shade she had seen or thought she had seen foster corbett dodging behind the tool shed just visible left of the house
she had said nothing to her father fearing to excite him fearing to jeopardize the reconciliation for which she and stan plotted
the terrible events following had obliterated the matter from her memory
utterly till now
how could she have forgotten it its astounding implication
the murderaxe whose bloodsmeared helve had shown no fingerprints had come from that very shed
perhaps it was not yet too late
perhaps if she told her story shrill sound sliced across the thought
it stopped spurted again
rrrring rrrring rrring
it whirled leila around to it
rrrring rrring rrring
the telephone three rings the monroy signal who could be phoning her
stan
incredible
eve starr perhaps
eve her neighbor and closest female friend calling to extend sympathy consolation
like eve to remain loyal when every one else shunned her
rrrring rrring leila flinging across the room into the hallways dimness jerked the receiver from its hook
hello
lock your doors a hoarse unrecognizable voice grated without preamble
lock your windows
a voice choked coarsened by some inexplicable terror let any one in
not any the telephone was suddenly dead with the flat inanimate deadness of a line from which the humming life of its current has gone
dead had the storm blown down a frail wire or had some human hand cut it
some human hand just too late to stop the husked warning
some human hand
icy terror one more struck at leila monroy
the hand of some one who even now crept up on the house
then she was moving had flung herself to the great front door was thrusting into its socket the heavy bolt clamped to its sturdy oak
the back door was already locked she remembered
the windows shutters creaked out of recesses in their embrasured sides to the frantic pull of her trembling hands were also bolted
she rushed in frenzied haste through dining room through kitchen clicking on light as she went light from which sliadows fled that were black sinister silhouettes waiting around comers behind doors to spring upon her
the lower floor was at last a blaze of light was a locked and barred fortress against whatever menace threatened
the lower floor but there was the upstairs yet the upstairs that was blacker as dilated pupils stared up into its mystery because of the luminescence about her
no longer was it the warm familiar bedroom floor of the old house but a precinct of stygian gloom haunted by some darknessshrouded threat
the girls small fingers tightened on the newel post to which she clung tightened till the blood was driven from them and they were grey trembling splotches against the lustrous patina of the wood
it was only the dark up there of which she was afraid
over and over she told it to herself
it was only because of the dark that she had that hint of evil lurking just beyond the stairhead of monstrous evil crouched just beyond the range of her vision haunched and waiting to pounce upon her
there was nothing more in the corridor above leila assured herself than shadows like the eerie phantoms that had fled from the lights she had turned on
nothing
a shriek sliced down to her the hh shrill scream of a wom in deadly taror
it checked off faded into vague thumpings as of a fierce struggle into the thud of a stormtossed brandr against the building wall it came again muscles twitched in cheeks
insensate humorless laughter sounded in her fluttering throat
it was the wind that had screamed from up there tightening her scalp with fear
it must have been the wind
no one could possibly be op there
bui she was afraid
afraid to go p there and look
afraid of the storm and the dark
a sharp crackle jerked her stared wideeyed at the entrance door
fool that had been only the splintering of a galeriven brandi it came again
unmistakable this time
the crunch of a heel on the gravel pathway outside a foot thudded on the porch just beyond the door and unseen fingers rattled the door knob
through a crashing peal of thunder the terrified girl heard a threatening hoarse bellow
swneone was just the other side of the sturdy portal
some one the killer i the mad killer seeking her
he bellowed again pounded wild fists on the wood
the great panel shuddered under flie berserk attack
its hinges creaked
the furious pounding piled a frizied terror on her fear of the storm and the dark
realization pierced her that only five feet of air two indies of wood sqsarated her from the monstrous creature that had made of shean rourke a mangled horror
it twisted her about sent her hurtling headlong up the stairs that a moment before dread bad barred to her sent her dashing dirou the lightless corridor in instinctive flight to tlie fancied sanctuary of her own bedroom
her hand clutched the knob of its door swung her to it franctically she thrust open the panel slammed it shut behind her leaned back against it gasping quivering
rain lashed against the window pane threshed on the roof above her
dulled by distance the savage pounding on the door below beat about leila as though tangible blows buffeted her
momentarily the lightning had ceased
the chamber was obliterated by tarbarrd daricness
a feeling grew on leila dial she was not alone here
leila monroy whimpered stabbed blindly at the lightswitch she knew jutted from the wall to her right
the small room sprang into sight a dishevelled apparition stared at her from her dresser mirror russet wedth of hair tumbling about her now pallid face mouth twisting and livid grey eyes dark with the frenzy of her terror
she pulled her gaze from it saw the bed crumpled on its scarletflecked counterpane lay the contorted body of a girl hair veiled her face but where a pink frock had been cruelly tom away lurid fingermarks on a white throat showed the manner of her death
her death there was no motion no movement at all in the awful stillness of the pathetic figure
the exposed blanched breast stirred with not the slightest breath eve leila whimpered unable to do no more than stare aiul whimper
eve forgotten the tumult of the storm the battering at the entrance door
forgotten everything but the horror that burst within her skull
but she had no memory of arrival
no mory time must have dropped out of her consciousness
time for her to have summoned the girl to have lured her up here time enough for her own hands to have clenched on her friends throat to have pressed pressed until life no longer throbbed beneath her throttling fingers the phantom in the treei to leila monroy that she could feel in her icy palms memory of the soft fleshs slow crumple beneath their lethal construction
once she had hated eve when the girl quite openly had tried to win stan corbett away from her
that jealous hatred had passed away with her own triumph and they had been friends again
had it passed had it not rather sprung to sinister existence with the blood madness inherited from the father they had led away to a padded cell darkness smashed down as the light went out
the window was momentarily a blue oblong flickering with the electric radiance of lightning
leila a voice came up to her
open up
stan leila
stan stan he had come for her as he had come for her father
he had come to drag her shrieking to the same chamber of horrors where justin moore had agonized
he would have to catch her first
if she were mad she would avail herself of a lunatics cunning
from a window at the end of the passage rainspout clamps made an easy ladder to the ground
tlie storm would hide her she would bury herself in the woods leila got the door open behind her flung out into the hall
thunderous crash of the portal below met her and the tempests howl blasting in through the house
the sound whirled her startled glance in its direction
the stairs were in darkness feet thudded on the steps coming up
lightning glimmer threw climbing shadow against the wall made visible the face of a crouching figure
it was the grizzled distorted face of foster corbett of own father i waiting for his son with a revolver uplifted in his hand
stan
leila screamed
look out
a shout drowned her out a blast of bestial fury
somewhere a shot blazed and then the world crashed in on her
she fell headloi into a limbo of whirling coruscating sparks
she felt herself lifted in powerful arms felt herself thrown over a heaving shoulder
shouts shots echoed about her a gibbering chatter of apelike defiance
rain drenched her an icy gale pounded at her
oblivion claimed her
a leila dared to lift her lids bit by slow bit
she blinked
darkness was about her strangely mottled with glancing fragments of silvery light
darkness and glistening dank rock above her
the earthy smell of a tomb in her nostrils
she was it dawned on her in a shallow cave
the luminous flecks dancing about her were splotches of moonlight shifting through the leaves of high trees
a cave trees this must be west cliff then
leila thrust herself up to a sitting posture as terror sliced her
was this the cave of the monster
but there wasnot any monster she thought
there was only the criized slayer who had hacked shean rourke with an ax who had throttled eve starr who had crouched with lethal gun to shoot down stan corbett
not any phantom monster
not justin toy either nor leila hwself
foster corbett
for a moment leila forgot her pain her danger in the jubilance of that revelation
dad was no maniac killer nor was she
it was foster corbett who had schemed with the cunning of the insane to slay and pfece the blame for his crime on the man he hated
foster who had dragged a second victim to leila bed so that the daughter should be doomed t the same terrible fate to which he had condemned the father
foster corbett who losing all hold on ron had haunched in th stormbattered corridor waiting to kill his own son
had he
had he added filicide to the role of his crimes
a sliot had blazed across her scream of warning just before the madman had whirled to attack her
if stan had fired edtl tmaniac could not have moved so sw scljftllt had been fifed at stan then h itself in his breast
in the le areaof the man ste loved loved
leila ha iirom springing to her feet knew love for stan was no not de a sob t6re at her throat
she ne rcgb to him
reddess that at ward to the caves entrance
then she froze as a rattle of rolling pebbles came up to her from bdow tire cavern mouth i of stones dislodged by some one the face of the cliff
he was coming for her
he had home her here left her here wliile he pursued some other dreadful mission of his murderlusting brain and now he was returning to work his mad wdl upon ha

helpless
leila lip snarled up from her tiny teeth
she was suddenly a creature of the wilds
the desperate courage of hopelessness entered into her the feral cunning of wildernesss small beasts who will fight must fight when escape from their persecutors has become no longer possible
she stooped snatched handfuls of jagged stones from the cave floor flitted to its entrance silent as a cloud peered out and down slyly cautious
there he was i like a huge black spider clinging to the splattered bare precipice
working his way up indomitably slowly by the necessity of finding handholds footholds in the bare sheer rock face
hidden now by a pool of stygian shadow revealed now by fragments of leafsplintered moonlight
inexorably climbing to add her to the dreadful list of his victims
distorted by the eerie light he was somehow unhuman somehow a monster of primitive evil spewed out of the past
and leila monroy the weak thing he hunted was primitive too
primitive and pitiless
her hand flew back arced forward
a stone left it and struck fair on the skull of the maniac
the crunch of its landing came up to her sickened her but she flung another stone and another
a dark splotch apfeared on his forehead and then the man let go his holds plunged down a black sprawling figure crashed terribly in the underbrush below
a thrill of triumph ran through leila a hot thrill of triumph that was a torrid flame boiling in her blood
her laugh bubbled up in the dark silence of the forest
a shrill thin cacchination of black laughter spilling from her gaping throat rioting out in the rainwashed night
it was horrifying
her throat clamped on it
she checked it icy with loathing of the savagery that had inspired it quivering with revulsion at the thing she had become
she had killed a man and laughed with joy at the deed
she leila monroy qiff and forest whirled about her in a sudden vertigo
the hot flush of joy at thumping fall the jubilant laughter were these the reactions of sanity soaring glee at killing only a lunatic could feel it only a homicidal maniac
murder
while insane
what if the incredible acts she had ascribed to foster corbett were fetid illusions of her own darkened mind
what if she were indeed the lunatic slayer and he a good neighbor trying to save her from herself the victim of her mania
what if her hand that had slain him was gory already with the blood of eve starr and of stan no
not stan
that at least was clear to her even in her bewilderment
if stan were slain she could not have slain him
there was the test
only a madman would kill his own son
corbett or she
she or corbett
if stan were alive she was the maniac
if he were dead if he were dead the thought slashed at her like a sword
that she should hope for his death her stan upstanding frank eyed
no
rather that she be condemned to the eternal perdition of raving madness rather that she take a knife and slice it across her own throat
bullets do not always kill
was he lying thqre wounded desperately wounded suffering
not dead but bleeding to death while she dallied here delaying the aid that might save him leila licked dry lips with a trembling tongue
she was down on her knees on the narrow ledge that made a sort of porch to the caye
she swung over it was scrambling for footing against the sheer wall of the rock was inching down that perilous descent while weakness was kke water in her limbs while pain was a network of agony meshing her frail form
stan 1his name was a pra er on her lips as she attained the cliffs foot at last as she sent one shuddering glance at the still mound blacker against black that her missies had flung there
stan she plunged into the thicket
a root caught foot pounded her headlong into the mire
she lay as she fell heaving in great breaths of the dank air to her tortured lungs fighting for strength to rise to go on
the forest silence closed in on her a black pall of soundlessness
not altogether soundless
a vague ominous slither threaded it
it lifted head with a jerk despite the darts of agony shooting through her at even that slight effort
it pulled her burning stare through the treeboles that were grotesque giants reaching writhing arms down to pluck her from her miry bed
and then her scalp suddenly tightened
it drifted almost silently toward her wraithlike phantasmal
a vagrant beam caught it full and a scream formed in breast tore her constricted throat died at her lips
the phantom of eve starr was gliding toward her between the ebon trees
eve starr whose corpse leila had seen contorted in awful death on the gorestained counterpane of her own bed a dreamiand of dread blood jelled with in her veins
supernal terror queezed her heart as the apparitions ghastly approach held her eyes with the tppalled but helpless stare of a reptileludnated bird
and a twig snapped beneath eve starr feet
the sharp crackle of dried wood breaking beneath the pressure of a careless foot so little a thing to save one from blithering madness it forced reason into shuddering terror stung her to sanity with the realization that this was not a disembodied ghost advancing toward her through the obscurity of the fearfilled wood that it was flesh and blood that it was eve
leila moaned finding strength somehow to stand up
eve
startled the duskyhaired girl swung around to her fright distorting her bloodless countenance there she gasped
who is it her eyes were bumedout coals dark horror pitting the blanched whiteness of her visage
who leila hon
leila monroy
leila stark terror in that gusted exclamation
leila her hand went up to her throat to the blue bruises that splotched its whiteness the marks of throttling fingers
of whose fingers leila monroy knew that she must ask the terrible question though she was terrified of what the answer might be
eve she blurted
eve
who did that to you
who
was it was it eve
leila eve hadnot heard her touch me
or had she heard and was this the awful answer to the momentous question
keep away
the girl whirled dashed away
started to dash away
she stumbled went to her knees snatched for support at the rattling withes of a low bush swayed there in pitiful weakness
she was feeble so feeble
the cold and the damp of the woods would kill her before morning if she were left here alone

eve
leila reeled after her enough eve mamed to keep just ahead of bw just beyond reach
she was a flitting staggering form just ahead of leik always just ahead dwayv just about to drop but somdiow kecfmg m ir feet somehow maintaining a httle between them
the reason for her riiase slid away from lrik
she knew emly that she must catch the luminous wraith she pursued knew onty tliat rile most keep going through the nightmare blackness of the impeding forest

had disappeared
she wasnot anywhere in st and there was no sound to tell where she had gone
had she after been pursuing a phantom created hy her own mad brain
was rile doomed forever to wander a dreamland of drid in which siis would be unable to distinguish the from the unreal
doomed forever see these very trees seemed instinct with a baleful life
they semed to be closh in on h
one of them aur movii was coming toward her with a slow iidmitely evil deliberatiott
it couldnot be moving
she was imagunng it
how could a tree move it wasnot a tree
it was a bent massive ure of a man huge browless head set neckires on gargauiriuan shoulders naked torso gleaming eeri in the moonlight fes rowing redty out of an droding countenance
it was the of the qiff
but she had killed the monster
no fliat was corbett she had killed
this monster didnot exist
it was a figment of her knsnarion this bestial thing that crept inexordly toward her
it wasnot there at all and she wouldnot run from it
if she didnot run from it it would vanish smd she would be sane again
she must not be afraid of it
she must not be afraid of the bigmuscled arms that seemed to reach out for her of the stubbed and fearful talons
that closed on her arms with a sudden fearful pain diat told her the thing was real
that told her too late diat it was ldla screamed hut tfie shrill cry of lier terror and her ony was drowned by the ferocious overwhelming roar of the 6ter
towering over her he slammed her against the shaggy unyielding bark of a giant tree behind her trying to crush her it seemed into the very heart of the quivering timber driving breath from her so that she could scream no longer
she could not scream but she could flail desperate fists against the steelhard thews of his giant arms
the beast laughed at her puny efforts chatteringly gibberingly
his blacklipped mouth opened to display yellow rotted fangs a cavity in which the flesh was not red but a hideous black
leila writhed jerked free
almost jerked free
the knee came up thrust excruciatingly into the softness of her abdomen pinned her helpless against the rough treebark behind that cut through her flimsy dress and stabbed her with countless tiny points
pinned her helpless so that one of his bestial paws released its grip and flew to the neckline of her frock
it tore downward as the seamed hairless countenance mowed with insensate obscene glee
pretty the thing chattered
pretty and his leathery palm fumbled at breast rasped it with a lewd caress
calban likes girls hand spatted against the indurated cheek her toes banged at the shins
he squealed like a stuck pig and his fingers flew to her throat clutched it constricted lungs pumped unavailingly fighting for air they could not find
the brutal digits tightened still more till the girl thought they must cut right through the flesh must squeeze clear through her neck
knives stabbed and twisted within her chest invisible fingers gouged at her eyes
the glaring ferocious visage of her tormentor vanished in a great roaring blackness
through which she seemed to hear a high piercing whistle
the roaring in her skull was drowned in the blast of feral roar
the whistle came again and leila crashed to the ground as the terrible grip on her throat the pinning thrust of the bestial knee were released
leila wallowed in her distress while somewhere above her a tumultuous sound crashed momentarily and died away
she pulled air into the sore agony of her lungs
leila stan cried somewhere above her
it wasnot stan
it couldnot be stan
stan was nng dead in the old house that had suddenly become an abode of horror
stan had bled to death there because she had not been able to get to him in time to save him
leila darling hands were tugging at her were rolling her over hands
his dear face was looking down at her anxiety clouding his eyes face leila
speak to me
leila
the girl sat up
he was dishevelled
his troopers uniform was gashed tom by the tearing brambles of the forest and there was a livid weal across his tanned cheek that a lashing tendril had mbde
but he was alive
it was stan who had saved her at the last possible moment from an awful death
stan
what how did you get here
how was knocked out there in your house i came to heard the back door close
i rushed out there and saw you vanishing into the woods been hunting for you then wasnot talk now stan silenced her hurt exhausted
when i get you home get you warm you can tell me all about it
he was tender solicitous
he loved her tiil
leila nestled in his arms thrilling to his strengtfi thrilling to tlie feel of his heart beating inst her own
she would him she wold keep qniet ior a few if started to talk if told him that it had been eve be had seen not her she would have to tell him the rest
she would have to tel him that the girl hi his arms bad killed his father
how could she tel him that
how could she
the black trees of the forest slid by nistling in the night
leila whimpered
hush darling stan murmured soon be out of this soon be where its warm and light
light
would there ever be light again in her dark soul
daricer than ever now
thought burred through aching brain
stan had been attacked in the house had been imecked unconscious
that was evident
foster corbett must have done that iyit in ambush
ttien leila must be san but eve actions bad confirmed tlie awftd speculation that it was leila who had attacked her
leila in whose mind no mory remained of the terrible deed
that proved her insane
there wasnot any answer
there be any answer because she didnot know tow much of her experiences was real bow much she had forgotten how modi she tod imagined
the monster for instance comii had saved her frn him but stan didnot seem to kjiow anything about him
had that lecherous attack been only her own madness
had her own mamac fingers tom the clothes from her shoulders clamped tightening about her own throat
or had call his ttocshing approach frightened the brute away before the trooper could see him over shoulder leila saw a shadow move high up on the bough of a tree
it liaunched came sprawling down great aims spread spatuiate talons clawing for throat i masur oi dw moaitn leila monroy shrieked and in his arms driving her forehead against bis chest
this instantaneous inspiration of her terror was the only thing that could have saved her lover
it imbalanced him sent him reeling backward and the downdropping monster missed his mark
the brute crashed down into the underbrush was mentarily tangled in the whipping leaves in that instant leila slipped from hold as the trooper recovered his footing and reached for his hollered gua
calban bdlowed soared the ground
his stoggy arm lashed ahead of him with a cotoas lightninglike lash gunwrist pounded the weapon from it its metallic gieain sliced into the underbru and the antagonists came tether with a thud of fiesh against fie that was thunderous to the terrifiai girl fists pumped two flashing istons into taut belly
the monsters musclebulging arms damped around the trooper in a ribcracking clinch
they swayed black and gigantic in the eerie fore light and from the taut straining agony erf that cdinch burst an appalling cacaphony of bestial sounds of growls and vicious snarls
a shrill piercing squeal forced by unendurable pain frem a strong mans ups galvanized leila into action
she dreped to her knees searching frantically in the meshed baffling underbrush for gun
the tumult of that eerie battle increased behind her a chattering mindless scream signalled that stan had got heme a telling blow
run leila the man yelled
get iway
i canot hold him
the girl twisted saw calban momentarily driven away from stan closing in again
her lover met the renewed attack by a ferocious uppercut exploding from a crouch
his fist landed on the monsters jaw with the blast of a rifle shot his other fist crashed against the brutes chest
the devastating blows might have been ricks of a flys wings for all the effect they had
calban was not even staggered
his huge paw closed on neck engulfing it with its vast span
his swarthy other hand drove for the mans groin
somehow a thick stick was in hand and she was hurling herself shrilling primitive fury at the monster
her improvised club pounded against forehead
he roared with anger rather than pain and the hand that was reaching for groin flicked sidewise instead
it struck leila in midair catapulted her backward crashing her into the threshing cushion of a bush
jarred and halfstunned she saw attack focus again on stan saw her lover swept from his feet saw him lifted high above the grisly creatures head by straining arms shaggy with a beasts black hair
the terrible tableau etched itself on mind
the gorillalike brute his bestial ferocity the more horrible for the fact that he was no beast but a man degraded obscenely decadent poised momentarily motionless as he gathered his forces for the throw that would smash stan to a pulp
above his head stan was as motionless rigid and helpless in the gigantic grip of leathery hands at armpit and crotch his face contorted and pallid his eyes staring in agony an eternal moment that awful pause persisted
and then the lurid gleam of beady savage eyes flared more redly and the muscles in his huge arms writhed snakelike beneath their hairy skin and leila knew that in the next instant they would sweep downward
from somewhere a whistle shrilled high and piercing through the quivering terror of the woods
it came again the strange high sound that once before leila had heard through black clouds of death swirling about herself
it froze calban to an astounding paralysis leashed him as though it were a chain writhing about his savage limbs
leila could almost see the deaththought seep unwilling from the black and terrible frame protest was a grisly roar blasting through the black forest aisles
the huge arms bent slowly reluctantly letting stan down
the trooper twisted abruptly freed himself from loosening grip
he thudded to the ground sprang erect snarling but the monster was gone had away into the veiling thickets
for minutes the lovers heard the threshing of his huge evil body moving away and then a sinister silence close about them
a silence sinister because it cloaked not only the ravening manbeast but another mysterious entity a lurking invisible being who was master of the monster whose whistling command the brute obeyed even in the height of his frenzy
twice leila had heard the weird whistle twice it had saved her
not her but stan
it had been at approach that the ravening human hound had been called away tliat first time it had been stan whose deadly peril had just now been averted
if it were not for stan god the youth groaned
who is he
where did he come from
he pulled a trembling hand across his bruised forehead above his glazed unseen eyes swayed with exhaustion
why did he quit just when he was about to slam me down ssd facreak kme in bof struggted out o ds ngtoig bu which caibtfi hd flung her dorft know stan
sm was cold ky with foreboding widi realizathm of a tersibie enmity focused upon heraeif
her cmped as stan pitchad ferward pounds hmp dmim hy and tmconsciais hi spongy loun
leia texdwd to bun
her hand flew to a dark spreading stain on shirt found warm visdd wetness
it was tod
his bioodi but caiban had no knife grl tore away with trembling fingers
the angling wound across his riba from whidi the gory airy fluid gued was no knifeslash
it was the path of a bullet and under the fresh scarlet pour yfs the bttss of aa
dd leife ripped a hasty bandage from the tatters to which her own frock had been rtucd worked frantically to ttwt grisly flow
and as rfe wrfced a vague estplanation of what ld happeied formed in her mind
hfes mad fathers bulkt had ploughed across ribs had ffia him down at the foot of the stairs
tlw slow seepe had stopped itsdf
he had come awake
hearing what he thought was leila running out of the house he had his wcertions the battle with the apefaced monster had opened die wound afresh
weakened by the new loss of blood he had fainted once more
now he lay here unconscious in the black depths of the forest
he lay bwe and she with him and somewhere in the glimmering caninous shadows calban roved and tseck pridded abruy with tibe sense of eyes upon her of glaring hostile eyes
leave rustled stealthily
sie crouched low over stands senseless form throwing the frail protection of her bt body him and quivered with the kn we that eut of the tmuk h eneny was creeping silentiy to le upon her and destroy her leap upon her ft was she the unseen adversary threatened not stan danger lay only in toat was wito him
twice that had been proved
if she cotdd lead the chase away from stan she leaped from her lovers recumbent form
come and get me she cried and was hurtfing once more through the lashing tearing brambles of the woods
was running headlong and blindly through the shadowed aisles not knowing where she ran not caring so icaig as it was away from stan so long as e led the destroyer away from the man she loved
the forest crashed into sudden life behind her
some one was following her was flinging after her a hollow echoing shout
its direat spurred her to renewed efforts
despairing fraaticv guping feargoaded girl catapulted through the tearing brambles crashed into stunning treetrunks catomed and ran on
and then suddenly was of the farest
she was nmniag down a wet but grasssoft stope and before lier across the familiar pastore was the yellowwindowed bulk of lier own hou uack apiast a sky tinted by the haunting gray of false dawn
aknoet at once she was in lr own back yard was leng the backporch steps was tugging at the knob of a friendly kitchen door
it resisted her efforts
it would not open
she gasped remembering that she bad herself iodtod it from toe ktside
unhqjed for safety tantalizingly offered at the last moment was snatched away
leila whirled to meet the fate from which she had fled
silver of the setting moon sluiced an empty field
no one nothing was there
she had outdistanced her invisible pursuer had left him behind in the forest
or had he fooled her as she had thought to fool him
had he left her fleeing blindly through the woods while he turned back to pounce upon and destroy the lover she had planned to save by her rejected sacrifice
something moved there in the ribbon of darkness that was the forestedge across the fields
something moved and came lumbering out into the brooding lunar luminance
a twoheaded grotesque monster it came slowly inexorably out of the shadows
gelid fingers clutched throat
what nightmare thing was this what awful spawn of the dark forest
the porch floor heaved beneath her feet threw her back against the paintpeeled door
it wasnot there she fell backward through it fell against a warm feminine figure the matter
eve starr exclaimed
where have you been
dose the door leila screamed
close it
somehow she was on her feet again had her hand on the wood of the portal
she threw a single terrified glance through the opening and checked the closing panel
nearer and distinct now in the silvery light she saw what it was that had come out of the woods
saw lolling pallid face
saw that he was leaning heavily on the shoulder of another man
of her blood was a black flood in her veins of foster corbett
of his grizzled father who she thought lay dead at the foot of west high parapet
she knew now who was master
she knew now whose high shrill whistle it was that had twice drivoi the monster from his prey to save stan into tbe grifly night eve cried
why is your door broken down and the place upset scared you so
leila monroy twisted to her fell back in astonishment
the girl whom last she had seen with a few shreds of torn clothing fluttering from her lacerated almost naked form was fully dressed her hair carefully arranged no signs of the wild night about her saw your lights come on after the storm and i came over to see if anything was the matter
i found eve cut off as stumbling feet pounded on the boards outside the door as foster corbett staggered in with his greyfaced limp burden
stan
mr corbett
in the name of all thats holy whats been going on here
never mind now the older man grunted
help me
leila jumped to his side
eve
together the three lifted stan from his wavering legs carried him in to the living room where hours ago leila had cringed from the whispered lash of fancied voices and laid the youth on the couch there
stan groaned his lids flickered open
where where dad his eyes lighted up
leila you both here
both all right fairly all right son the old man answered
there was a black bruise on his brow another on his check
his clothing was smeared with the brown loam into which he had fallen his shoes were packed with it otherwise he seemed unhurt
his ueamt brooding gaze fteaed an leila slid to eve weat twk to stan do
but you need a doctw call no
stan sboved himself up to a sitting position and leila winced as his face twitetod wit the pain of the effort
no kind of frayed at the edges but tart
tm itae eve
i wutt to know wltfd this ta all atawt
leila started to spesdt but the old man beat her to it an fike to know that stan
suppose you give us your story first he was starting wrong end to leila thought there was a reason for that
he was conoeating sometiikig
of course he was concealing something
he was master
kc was die moving force behind the terrible evente of ae night and he wanted first to hear how much the others know before he ceacocted his own stery to fit
she w8iridol interfere keep quiet and give hia rope eimugh to liang himself and then but stan was tafidng tried to get to leila after the iwti but she was gone by the time i managed to shore through the crowd
i saw eve though told ho to t leila come to her as soon as my tour of duty was over
the storm eaug me as came up ffte road lights were all on heard a seren from the house and she didnot answer when i knocked on the door
that scared me
i went frantic started to batter down tte door
the lights weat out just as it gave way
i ploughed in yefiiz for her
the lightning showed me she wasnot on the lower floor
i started up the staks
i heard her scream again
a shot jabbed me
it seared across my ribs jolted me off balance guess i must have gone down on my head and knodced myself out because noct thing i knew it seemed a long time after i heard the door dose ami w her nmmi into e woods eyes sicked to eve
the girl was listening openmouthe did not interrupt to correct misapprehension
that was queer
queer as her evident ignorance of all tlmt had happased to her or had seemed to have hamened to her
if she had lain dead on the bed above if she had run screatmng in terror of leila herself ffiroi the woods how couki she be so nea dresd so uadtatmibed
the awful dibt of her own reason closed in once more on leita with ks nameless fear
tinaeceuntably ttie brute chipped me and and i fainted again from loss of wood stan fitirehed
then you were bending over me
dad mfere hrfpii me up how about you leila
fortw corbett tamed to her your end of the story eyes bored into her and in their rheumy depths she saw littie light of triumph crawl
if she answered she must convict herselfof eer incredible madness
of madness
how coidd she tell of filing eve apparaidy dead of the strange scene of her terror in the woods when the girl hersdf was so calm so tmperturbed so evidently ignorant of it that
how could confess to the attack on father
her month opened dosed again
she swayed put out a gromig hand to the arm of a chair to keep hwsdf fni falling
and eve
ame to her rescue yon s how weak she is mr corbett the darkhaired girl indignandy exdained as she jumped to ude ami hdped her into the diair
she canot talk
but weve got to get at the bottom of this thing corbett insisted damn queer goii on
seem to tm youve gat a sy tvt eve countered why doot yeo k
had the same thought occued to her too that the man had taken charge of the aituatloa in order to up his own guilt
how come you were out there in die woods at this time of the morning
yes dad
stan put in puzzling toa ctebett made a peculiar gesture with his gnarled hands as of defe canot hrip nuidi he said
but tell what i know
when the storra feffobe i thoght of leila and looked out of window to try and see she were alone over here
the lightning struck into that line of poplaas betweoi our farms
i saw some one among them just at the spot where we found shean rourke a dark crouching figure watching the monroy house
there was somhing ksdescrihahly in his pose and it flashed oil me diat perhaps we had been all wroig aboot beiri murderer that perhaps diis was the real kfllcr and toat new he was after leila
he rted moving in the moment i glimpsed him dodging low the high grass of the pasture
i lost sht of hhn ran to the phone to warn leila
i just had time to tell her to lode her doors and windows when the wire went dead
i snatched up my gun ran out to cone to her aid
her lights were going on i saw her shadow going from window to window pulling dw screens across them
and tten i saw the fellow spotted before
he had climbed to the little roof ewer the kitchen porch was sliding into a window up there knew that because of ray own warning letk wonld not open the door to me
by the time i got her to understand the prowler woidd catch her would kill her
my orfly course was to go after him the way he had entered try to ca him before be did any demse
the sflm redoubled in violeiice and i am an man me hours it seemed before i managed to get to tiv house before i managed to climb tip to diat snudl slanting roof
i heard a muffled scream from icsnk as i into toe room up toere heard a damnal paadcmotilum gmng an
the room was pitdi bkde and a minute passed before found toe door sxtd got out into the halt just as i did so the door crashed in behtw twisted to the stskway htd some cie shout down there as he came in could not make out the words
then i reccnized voice and in the same instant some one screamed behind me
some one screuned and a bkxk form surged at me from somewhere behind struck me
the blow my finger that was preseiflg the trigger e tl gun and fired the shot
i whipped around time to see that same dark gfrotesque form pounce on leila and carry her i shouted did not dare shoot for of hitting her
the invader hurtled along the corridor dived a room at the very end
i went after win for stan was out dad and didnot hear you
so know now
that rowi door was jammed and by the time i opened it the chamber was empty
but the window was open and torough it i saw the kidnaper vanishing into the wood leila on his shoulder
i saw that he must have climbed down a rainspout that passed the window but i didnot dare follow that way
the head of the back stairs however was at this end of the corridor
i ran down them out through the back door ain across the fields and into the forest where i had seen the fellow vanish
in the storm i couldnot trail him
i shouted fired off my gun in the hope leila woidd respond
in vaki
then the storm was over as suddenly as it had begun
the clouds started to break
moonlight sifting through showed me trampled bushes shreds of a girls clothing caught on briars
i followed that trail reached the face of west cliff
just above where the spoor ended i saw the mouth of a cave thought i sensed movement within it
possibly i thought my shots had scared the kidnaper away and leila was alone up there
i started to climb up to it
suddenly rocks started to fly down at me
one struck me on the head
i felt myself falling struck and lost consciousness
leila thought his story fitted
was it the truth or a tissue of lies
somehow it explained everything too patly everything except who the monster was and where he had come from except the mystery of eve weird part in the dreadful night face was an expressionless mask her unfathomable eyes fixed on seamed horribly tired countenance
when i came to i heard the sounds of struggle faroff
a pile of dead leaves had cushioned my fall i wasnot badly hurt
i staggered to my feet ploughed tlirough the woods and found stan knocked out
or had he come on that scene just a little earlier in time to whistle off calban in time to send the monster ravening after her through the woods
was he playing still for a chance to get her alone to finish her
the speculation wrenched a groan from the bemused girl
leila eve exclaimed white
you look as though you were going to faint ni get you some water
she was out of the room as her sentence ended
the kitchen door swung closed behind her
leila foster corbett spun to her
what do you know of actions tonight
have you seen her
a scream sliced across her amazing question a scream from behind the kitdien door
corbett slewed around
gun in hand he hurled himself across the room pounded that door open
the brickwalled room beyond was starkly gruesomely vacant but the back door was just slamming shut and from beyond it a thin high wail of infinite terror told where eve had vanished got her now the old man yelled was wrong
come on stan
and then he too was gone into the grisly night
monster at play came up out of her chair fighting the intangible but cloying threads of her weakness fighting a giddy nausea that whirled within her skull and tweaked at the pit of her stomach
through that dizzy whirlpool she saw vague form dart past her lurched to follow it
the room seemed to whirl about her as she moved there was a wall where the door should be a wall into which she jolted she pawed at the partition found the door away from which she had reeled in her vertigo reeled through
the kitchen a place of black threatening shadows danced about her
she staggered across it stabbed at the outer door missed it pulled in an agonizing breath and tried again
this time leila contrived to grab the doorknob as it went by and steadied herself by it
gripping the jamb with her other hand she fought to get the porta open succeeded
something lay a black unmoving bulk on the porch outside
stan
it must be stan her bemidered at her and she went to her knees beside it
sbe pijed at it her durred visimi re fumg to clear
the bo cfone suddei alire over
the apdit ferodous vag of die monster glared at her uack curling aw from fangs la a strange jabbering laugh of bestial triumph
a scream her throat and then gigantic arms flawed around her crushing her to him crudung her ribs clamping tha scream to sileaoe ia her breathless lue
he surged to his fed bringing her with him as though she had no weight at all
he lidched beck into the house with her the kitchen the uric room he ploughed chudding lewd glee
into the foyer he sliouldered the piggish little eyes under his beetling brows lurid with an obscene light his calloused rasping fingers writhing as though with sane vile life of thek own on her shrinking quivering flesh larynx swells once more with a shriric but celban caught her intention by some unhuman secondsight ami gagged her her with the pressure of his slobbering lips on hers in a kiss of ulrimate horror
crushed thus in the visehke cradle of the arms gaed thus by his insuflfierable caress leila knew that he was carrying her up the broad stairs to the passage above
to the passage where her own room was her onmt bed no doubt now no doubt at of what the bruteman intended
no doubt of what he intended or of what had happened
he ld been waiting outside had grabbed eve and killed her probably
foster corbett had taken advantage of the girls one cry to get out of the way hunself to get stan out of the way and had sent back his creature to finish off leila unlocked for presoice time and tsne again had interfered with his macaber jdans but was out of the ymy now id lrila was in power being carried up to the room where the mghts horror had begun and now would be consummated
calban was the room thrusting the doew sl with a foot as he passed thrm twisting to the bed with a swift surety that told of curious familiarity with its locion
even in that terrible moment leila noted that noted that her white was rumpded and bloodflecked that the indenmtion of a contorted figure w stifi visible on it then calban had flm her shmniiy down on the bed had pihned her to it with a digging cruel knee as he tore avidly at what was left of her clothing
pre he jabbered as he had jabbered before in the forest
pretty
catban likes
he paid to oat over the quivering beauty his violating paws had revealed
calban likes very much tortured eyes fled from the evil antietpm of his drooling mouth slid past the musdes of his terrible arms
her hopeless gare id akmg the walls of h room that now was a ceil of ndness and despair reached the door
it was evening
slowly silently it was oponing and white fingers joed its edge
the girls heart leaped
please she whimpered pulling her gaze back to her tormentor
please calban let me go
at all costs she must distract his attentiwi keep him from notiedng the advent of her rescuer pay you give you lots of money jewels
the monster gibbered his mindless laugh
calban no want money jewels
calban want pretty wanan white soft flesh of pretty woman
ijke this and suddenly he leaped away from her leaped to the center of the room and whirled to the opening door
some sixth sense had warned him of danger jumped into the room a long carving knife in his hand that must have come from the kitchen below
leila he yelled
run jump out of the indow
i can hold him long enough calban roared plunged at him
stan met the attack with a darting slash of the knife caught the monster across the knuckles
the other fist crashed against the troopers shoulder him against the wall
leila screamed started up from the bed
calban twisted to her
a flick of his long arm pounded her back to the creaking mattress
stan rebounded from the wall sliced at calban
the giant sprang backward avoiding the rush dropped to the floor and rolled toward the trooper
leila was out of the bed was darting once more toward the window
black digits closed on ankles heaved upward
the trooper was flung high into the air
he twisted hthely came down on his feet crouched to meet his snarling adversarys lunge juggernaut rush swerved at the last instant and the girl felt the impact of his fists once more blasting her headlong away from attempted escape
she sprawled brought up thumping against the wall
stan ducked forward slashed a long cut across the others leathery cheek
calban squealed more in rage than pain and exploded into a swift blur of action which eyes could not follow nor stan avoid
suddenly that whirling battle was static terribly static stan hung from the giants tight clutch on his wrists hung from arms stretched horizontally out from his shoulders in that terrific grip
crucified on an invisible cross the troopers body was a taut arc of suffering his face a fishbelly white sweatwet mask of hideous torture
a low moan squealed from his rigid throat squealed into sound
get out leila your chance gurgled into a nondescript gust of agony as gargantuan span of whipcord muscle widened to crack the bonejointures in his shoulders with the gruesome power of its living torturerack way to the door was clear as long as calban held the straddlelegged pose he must to continue his grisly torment of her lover
this was her chance to escape
she shoved away from the to which that last fierce buffet had flung her came up to her feet
came up to her feet with the light bedroom chair in her hands leaped toward calban and pounded the improvised weapon down on his head
the chair splintered smashed
calban let stan drop and whirled to leila he was laughing actually he was laughing his twitching ups spewed
calban like you that way
his hands lashed out his fingers dug into the girls shoulder sent fiery agony darting through her twisting almost nude body
calban like woman that can fight but canot play now
must finish with man first
tear arms out legs like flys wings
no leila screamed
no
leave him alone
do what you want with me but leave him alone simian visage was distorted by his yellowtoothed imbecilic grin
calban do what he like with both
she was helpless infantile in his great hands as he flung her once more on the bed as he ripped the sheets into strips and lashed her ankles her wrists lashed them tightly cruelly pulling the knots with sadistic violence
the rough edges of the tom linen cut into her shrieking flesh were scarletedged with oozing blood
on the floor behind the sava giani a img fodder ran through stan crunip itame and be was crawling as a steppedupoii ltle might in wtuxn life was yet te but unhke flt btle the man moved with a definite purpose a yard beyoid his shh hand lay the knife he had dropped
a yard to his anguish body dt yaid was an infinite dstacee
but if he could reach that knife leila seeing stoppered in her throat the momjs of her own agony sought to wrench from her and contrived a question to hold calban long enough for stan to succeed
what will your master say if you harm him
your master doesnot want you to cdban have no master the brute rage flaring into ws little eyes
no cmc tell calban what must or must not do
dismay pierced leila as he twisted away from her as he lurched toward stan whose scrabbling fingera were still mdies away from the inirfe
no one the whistle shrilled in the whistle that twice before had saved stan
a vague figure blotted the windows dim rectangle
mr corbett leila screamed killing stan killing a bargain with the rend foster corbett who came surging in tlirough the aperture
it was eve astoundingly it was eve
calban she yelled
the whisfle hadnot stopped the monster this time
he was lifting the lacerated almost unconscious man from the floor by one hand and his ofler was at diroat
calban
eve cried again
stop it the gnt msed
over the limp lolling frame of his vidam he ghoed at the darkhaired ghiy his face a denuxniac visage
no he chattered
calban will not be cheated any more
calbaa will tdll the man and take the woman your ties will net stop him aiu
calban
i not lie to you
grotesque hideeua this cofloquy between the slim girl whom leila monroy had known all her kfe and tire beetlebrowed barrelchested savage who was an atovism from the very dawn of time
it was you who foigot our bargain and tried to force from me what i promised would be yours when you finished the task i set you
if you hadnot attacked me choked me oh godt it was blasphemous even to think his name in the presence of that woman
you you fiend lefla burst out
you brwigtrt him here to kill me
you glance flicked to her and it ung leila aa if e evil in it were a barbed whiplash of frozen sted
shut up she hissed
you donot count now then she was concaitrating on the giant
calban she pleaded tet him go
let him live
lurid crawled siuisteriy in the brutes small eyes no he gnintwi and his throtdmg fillers started again to close bit by cruel bit on throat no
you want him and youll never give yourself to calban while he lives it is it cry was abruptly a hollow whisper of defeat what i must pay to save him here then calban
htre
her hands flew to her throat her fingers at the high lacy collar tliat veiled it
then the flimsy silk was ripping as those white lands tore down through it ripping away from her chest the creamy heaving rounds of her desirous breasts the taut quivering hollow of her abdomen
the shredded fabric slid down the long line of her thighs reached the floor and she threw out her arms to the beastman in an abandon of seduction noisome as the uttermost depths of hell and glorious as heaven itself
glorious because whatever the woman was whatever evil had driven her she descended now into hades to save the man she loved the man she loved
in that moment the whole story was clear to leila
eve loved stan and calban whimpered
he let his victim fall
he lumbered uncouth shaken by the tempest she had aroused within him to the naked alluring form of the temptress luminousseeming in the moonlight glow
his black arms slid around that voluptuous form
by some accident of the inscrutable fates stan had dropped right atop the knife he so futilely had struggled to reach
his twitching bloodless hand closed on its hilt
eve moaned shudderingly as shaggy arms enfolded her that moan seemed to explode in stan with a sudden spasmodic strength
he lifted to his knees flung the knife
point first it was a silver flash streaking the moonlight and then it was a black excrescence quivering from the middle of back
blood spurted
the monster squealed with the sudden pain
his great hands gripped the woman they had been fondling flung her from him in a paroxysm of rage
she catapulted into the wall
the crackling thud of crushing bone sickened leila
and then the bound girl was screaming in terror for her lover as the wounded beastman whirled and plunged ferociously at the trooper who was swaying on his knees was toppling over from the effort alone of throwing that knife writhing fingers closed on stan
thunder crashed in the room
it was the thunder of foster gun blazing from the doorway
long orangered jets of flame seared across the room great form jolted to the impacts of the lethal lead once twice
he collapsed like a ripped meal sack rolled over near his intended victim quivered and was still
foster corbett came in
he was mudcovered from head to foot a blue bruise blotched the seamed gray of his face and one trouser leg flapped grotesquely somehow in two disjointed halves
but the mans old tired eyes glowed with a strange satisfaction
you gals sure can play hell he growled when you get to fighting over a boy
he picked up the knife and sliced lashings then bent to his sons flaccid form
is is he leila dared not finish the question but corbett understood and answered it
no just knocked out and hes coming out of it now be all right by noon i imagine right enough to stand up with you in front of the parson and he wouldnot marry me now leila moaned
he wouldnot marry the daughter of a madman
madman hell corbett grunted swinging around to crumpled moaning body
his gnarled fingers probed the girls hurts with a curious tentemcss
then afraid youre through eve he said
maybe things will be a little better for your soul where its going if you tell leila yourself
white lips moved in face that was agony incarnate
yes i swore you never would have stan
calban imbecile living caves west qie everybody thought monster
i made friends nt3ssms murdbr 3t with him got him kill rourice throw blame your father kill love for yoa iastesd
a gush of blood burbled from her lips she writlied to a sitting position threw out her arms
forgive me stan
and then there wasnot an eve starr any more
only a pitiftd nude corpse slumped in a corner of the dreadful room pieoed it together afterward tale of that dreadful nigkt how learning of message that her plot had failed the lovemaddened girl must have determined to have her dpe kill leila

tke sinisterly handsome was the stranger who brought a secret gift to the girl whose dark beauty matched his own whence had he come

frances bra mklciletoii
author of pagm idocktry ftej
a ll day long i had been hoping against hope that young philip rice would reach palo alto plantation house by supper time
for a full year we had heard nothing from him had almost ven up any expectation of ever hearing from him jin
so my old heart was set fluttering a bit by that peremptory knock and i went to the door myself
birt when i reached it old jude had already opened it
i caught a glimpse of bob shane the only taxi driver in the county as he hurried down the graveled walk toward the gate
only a glimpse for he was almost out of sight behind the jasmine bushes and my old eyes had been drawn as by a magnet to the stranger who stood in the doorway looking into the gathering shadows of the hall
i canot describe him
he was tall and slender and dark with a face of free wild beauty
his eyes were black that black which is a total absence of light and when they looked at me i was lost in them completely filled with that insane desire which comes to some men on the summits of high places the desire to hurl oneself over the parapet to the ground below
for with all his beauty and grace there was about him something dreadful sometliing terrifying
if you will pardon this intrusion the stranger began
and his voice matched the rest of him
it was low and vibrant
at the sound of it i felt an icy hand close hard around my heart bring a memento from young philip rice the voice was continuing left him down south there
he made a curious gesture with his long slender beautiful hands
never had i seen such hands as his so sensitive so capable
i am an old man and shocks are bad for me
i stood there gasping
a then quite unexpectedly he smiled and i knew at once that my fears were foolish
i could see that he was just an extraordinarily handsome man who was asking hospitality at a door which for more than a hundred years had refused hospitality to none
come in i begged in confusion
the place is crowded and afraid i must put you in sherburne room spoke hesitantly for we never use that room at all
it has been called a haunted room ever since sherburne rice the second hurled a man out of it and down the north stairway to the death of a broken neck in the garden
but this was all eve when all of us gather to celebrate tbe date of the houses building
every room but that was full and i was imwilling to thrust so strange a guest upon any of my kin
he smiled queerly am sure i shall be at home there he said
my name is minos dis and i come from a strange far country
as i said i have brought a remembrance from your kinsman philip rice
for me
i asked
i admit my voice was eager
young philip had occupied the limelight at the family gathering last year
he was an explorer with an already brilliant and bewilderir history in spite of his youth
again the stranger smiled that strange haunting extraordinary smile do not know yet for whom it is intended he answered and his voice though low and very very quiet had something dreadful in it some hint of doom unthinkable have come to learn
and is philip he made a slight gesture with one perfect hand
it silenced me as if those slender fingers had dosed around my throat shall tell you all presently was all he said
i myself led the way upstairs to sherburne room
i did it reluctantly but i could see nothing else to do
and yet somehow as i opened the door into that orderly but long disused room i felt that there was a certain significance a certain fitness in ushering that man into that particular room
i could not umlerstand why i should feel so but i did
i saw to his comfort and left him there in that feared and haunted room
and as i walked away through the dim old hallway toward the stairs the mans strange and foreign sounding name kept echoit through my mind
it had somehow a faint familiarity
minos
had that not been the name of a fabled king of crete
a straie name and a strange man who laid claim to it surely
but then our hoise has icmg been used to strangeness and to heartbreak and to dread
it is an cdd house a pioneer house built solidly and substantially of brick
there are heavy iron bars at windows
there is a huge pantry behind the kildien and a deep cistern under the floor
and its time its people have been thankful for thinga
for palo alto has a dark and flameshot history
they say that pirate gold built it and that pirate and huecaneers tried tg raid it in the old days
and it is certain that withstood a siege in by santa men and a grim and furious battle fought up and down hs stairways in sixtyfive
and more heroic still when one of its women was marooned there in the flood of ninety nine she fought off the hungry drirfccrazed blacks and saved herself and her two baby girls from horror indescribable
a strong hard breed tfiose children of fearfully remembered sherburne rice who come back each thirtyfirst of october which is the date ifl the cornerstone to celebrate the building of our bouse strange things hpen yet something always brii us together again tiio very fascinaticm perhaps of the autre and the unpredictable
and our very terror urges us to make of it a very festive occasion even riotous with all the trappings and old wine brought up from the cdlar where rodney wife was once walled up alive
at least we are always glad to see each other and we always make a volant effort to be gay with games and dancing and laughter
but we were not gay this year it was dusk when i found patricia rice standing alone on the wide front gallery watching the darkness inarch down the turgid river
and i knew she was thinking of that time thirtysix years ago when the high ground the house stands on was an island in a sweep of muddy swirling water and shft stood tliere alone patricia is an old woman now a grave and sensitive and understanding woman and some people say a little psychic at times
she spoke without looking at me donot like it jerry
something is going to happen and its always queer things that ha in this house awful things thinking of the old days i told her
it isnot that altogether
i can fed something have as eerie a feeling as when i carried my babies into the burial vault out yonder to escape those maddened blacks
of course i do ways remember too niuch when i come here jerry
i canot forget that i stood guard beside the bones of sherburne rice the pirate and sherburne rice the terrible of reconstnrction days
i canot forget that it was the negroes terror of those very bones that saved me and my babies
but i lived through horror too
and i had to
dll two men
it does something to you jerry gves you a cert power
and i tell you something horrible is hovering over us something more horrible than anything that has happened yet wish young philip rice was on his way i uneasily been so long
but couldnot go on
and for a while we stood in silence we who are old and who remember such strange things
as for philip come to s that year for the first time
not one of us had ever seen him before
he had just got back then from an exploring trip into the heart of south america somewhere where white men had never been before
he had tried to fly over an inaccessible jungle he explained but the plane had crashed
he had come down in the outskirts of a city as yet unknown to white men a bewilderingly lovely deserted city
his eyes grew rapt as he talked about it he seemed to be lost in memories
his own enthusiasm fired even our earthbound imaginations
he made us feel that place its unimaginable splendor its beauty its vastness its unthinkable antiquity
and as he talked he seemed to me to be the very quintessence of the rices to be possessed of all their charm their beauty their love of adventure and their valor without those darker qualities for which so many of them have been famed
i loved the boy and i hated the way his eyes were held by moma lane
a tribe of indians mayas lived near the city he told us but they never entered it except for religious ceremonies and even then they barred him out
so he had to explore it by stealth taking his life in his hands at every venture within its sacred walls
he had stiunbled all by accident upon a mayan treasure house
the natives would have killed him if they had known
for these mayas had a rabid dread of white men
around their fires at night they told strange old legends of the conquistadors horrifying tales of pillage and torture and enslavement
there would never be another invasion of white men into their land they swore
yet paradoxically they had welcomed philip offered him membership in their tribe made of him a sort of reincarnation of their fair god
and i could understand that looking at him down the table
he was one of those fortunates whom people love at sight
certainly our whole family fell in love with him that night
and he
well he fell in love with moma lane the stepdaughter of one of our many cousins
she was one of those fair girls whose beauty seems to shine to dazzle mens eyes
and she was captivated with philip or with the things he stood for
their eyes were locked together while he told his tale
she was breathless eager
and she begged him to go back
but you must she cried you see
you brought nothing out with you
you have no proof of your discovery
go back get pictures and specimens and astonish the world
bring me a mayan amulet phil
philip laughed and shook his head
he knew the danger you see
if he having been a sort of god among the mayas before his escape should now return
it made me shiver even to guess at his punishment
besides the mayas had been in the habit of sacrificing the incarnations of their gods
that old puzzling heathen idea that the essence of the human god must go back at stated times to keep the godhead strong was one of the fundamentals of their religion
no one knew that better than philip
yet he did return to his mayan city
we heard about it later and the news had made my heart sink as if under leaden weights
i am an old man and i had loved that boy
and now some one had come wlio claimed to bring us news of him
but how weird and strange a messenger yes i believed with patricia tliat something was going to happen
something dreadful
something far worse than merely strange one of the darkies would go to sherburne room to summon our strair guest to supper
they made various plausibleseeming excuses but i understood
they were afraid
so i climbed the weary stairs myself stairs that had been tracked with human blood these many tunes
my liand a little as i knocked on sherburne door
that strange weirdly melodious voice bade me enter but i did no more than open the door
the stranger stood bareheaded in the lamplight
the unearthly beauty of him struck me with new force
my ey were so lost in that compelling gaze of his that i was barely conscious of the box he held between his hands not a large tox but extraordinary like everythit else about him
it had tlie look of having been made of a single opal yet impossible as that seemed i know that i thought nothing of it at the time
he shook his head slowly at mention of supper beed to be excused
he would join us later he said
and such was the sprfi he had me under that i no protest though deep down in me was an almost paralyzing fear
a guest who wmdd not eat our salt or brealt our bread with us was not that a gurat truly to be feared but as i turned away from titat hated room a queer chokedoff cry jerked my thoihts away
terror lent me strength
i hurried to door and jericed it open and lunged inside
she was standing by the hearth in the full light of the tall white candles on the mantel
her face was ghastly and she held both hands to her tiiroat
her eyes had tiiat supernatural look they sometimes have
as i cried out at her in terror she lowered iter hands and turned to loc at me
slowly her eyes regained their sanity
she swallowed hard thought for an instant that something had me by the throat was throttling me she whispered shakily
i donot know
if sherburne bice is walking it might be a ghastly business jerry
it would be like liira to want to avenge his kinsman if her voice died in a hoarse rattle in her throat
i got patricia downstairs someliow
a buriness that aipper
one of our sudden northers struck the ace just as the meal was served
before the fires could be built up to give adequate warmth the house was staridy cold
we were all shivering when we came to the loaded table
and the wind was crying in a bmishees dirge through the leaves of the live oaks keoiing under the eaves aioimd the cornices of the old house
a hound down in the quarters li fted his voice in the eerie howling that tells you death is passing
and the negroes moved on noiseless feet their dark skins grey their eyes wild their hands aquivcr with terror
and i could think of nothing but young philip rice whose infatuation for an emptyheaded girl had sent him into what must have been unthinkable and of the stranger who claimed to ame from lum mid of the cooleyed smiling moma lane who sat acnoss tiie table from me
we old folks sat about the fire in the back parlor after supper and listenal to the shrieks of the rising wind and told tales under our breatlj of the bloody deeds of shelburne rice the bucaam and of his grandscai sherburne rice the second
and while we whispered of past terrors and bloody deeds the young petle danced in the big front parlor bobbed for apples looked in mirrors and had their fortunes tc
but their attempts at gaiety were futile
the bht of tlte strangers presence was on them too
it was midnight when the strainer came into the dim temjdight of the room wliere we were wmting
the box i had seen in the haunted room iqstairs was in his hands
it seemed to me that a little chilly wind not bom of the shrieking norther outside came in with him
and the far away howling of the dog had now become an anguished maddened whine of fright
the music in the front room ceased
the young people crowded in witii us and sank down upon stools and cushions around the fire
morna eager piquant face stood out startlingly iu the soft light
i could not keep my old eyes away from her she seemed so excited so avid for the news that was coming
and suddenly i knew that i hated her
and the stranger stood in the wide doorway between the parlors and looked at us with his unfathomable eyes all knew philip rice he stated quietly in his grave deep organtoned voice
he was kin to you
some few of us murmured in assent
philip had been kin to all of us except to moraa lane
he went back to the village in the jungle the sonorous voiced rolled on
he must have known that death awaited him there yet he was driven by a force he could not resist
he paused and the silence was absolute except for the soft crackle of the fire and tlie wind and the howling dog
he went back
even then he might have escaped his doom if he had been careful for he had friends among the mayas
they are a remnant of a once highly civilized and mighty race as yet uncontaminated by intermarriage with other breeds
their great stone city is an amazing place
you would marvel at it if i could make you see it
where did the stones in its walls come from
they are huge and expertly cut
but what force brought them from their distant quarry what force lifted them to their destined places in the towering walls
no man knows
unthinkable wisdom those long dead mayas must have had unthinkable riches
their ancient treasure house would make the richest treasury in your world look like a beggars pittance
gold and strangely wrought ornaments and glowii gems
why did philip rice persuade the mayan girl who loved him to take him there that place was holy
he knew it
what untumable force could have sent him there
his black eyes moved from face to face and i saw men and women sway backward as his eyes moved over them even as a field of grain sways when a wind blows over it
he took something exceedingly precious from that treasure house the stranger said very quietly
and his eyes came to rest on the opalescent box between his hands
i saw moma lane lean forward just a trifle as if to see it better
but her face was inscrutable
i could make nothing of it
could she have cared for philip and still betray no sign now that he must be dead the mayan girl loved him with a selfless undemanding love
she helped him do the thing that he desired to do
she showed him a secret pass through the hills
because she loved him
savage women are like that sometimes women to whom love is everything even though the loved one lias no thought for them as philip certainly had none for her
his thought was all for the white girl who had sent him back
he was mad to get for her the bauble she demanded
and it was only through the native girl that he could get it so he took it and started home alone
and he might have escaped for the mayas made no attempt to pursue him
they but sent a messenger after him with the severed hand of the girl who had helped him
come back and burn their message said or we burn the woman instead he did not hesitate
he went back
and they gave his body to their gods screamed
i think the rest did too
i couldnot
my breath stuck in my throat
i was beyond the relief of any outcry
i was stuni
the stranger watched us with his relentless eyes tlwase eyes that were black with the blackness that is total absence of light
he lifted the priceless box that was neither large nor nall the box that seemed to be made of a single firetinted opal in his perfect hands
i bring back from the jungle he cried a pulse throbbir in his voice as the sacrificial drums must have throbbed in tile jungle while philip died
it is meant for some one itere
to whom does it belong
it was beautiful that box
it glowed ml glory in the ligtit of the leaping fire
no rainbow in the world could ever have shown such colors colors that wrkhed and burned mid faded and burned ain
but we drew tck frwn it in horror
it was accursed for all its beauty it was stained with another oolor that did not show
the color of blood
it belongs to one of you the stranger said inexorably
i saw morna lane lean forward suddenly
she gasped as a swimmer might gasp on tlie brink of an icy plunge
her hand reached out drew back reached out again
she tried to speak and could not
the stranger gave her a long still look from his fathomless eyes
it is yours then he asked and his voice was husky and filled with deep vibratioiw like die music that comes from the strings of a bass viol
still she could not speak
but she nodded jerkily and swallowed hard and her outstretched fingers clenrfied and unclenched and clenched again in a spasm of desire
he laid that lovely priceless thing within their grasp
he turned slowly and walked away his head bent like a man who was very tired into the front parlor and across it into the hall
i watdied him climb the stair slowly and sadly and yet with an air of duty done
when he had passed from sight my eyes came bad to that room of silence
only one of the group liad moved
morna lane was gone
the rest sat still whitefaced silentstricken the morning i went with weary plodding feet to call our stranger guest to brkfast
it was late in the morning then but only a few of the kin had come downstairs and they looked as if th had not slept
the wind still bowled
the hound was silent
oid jude imd whispered to me with tangled stammering tongue that during the niglit die dog had died of terror
my old hand shorfc as i knocked on the door of sherburne room
there was no answer and shaking as in a chill i pushed the door open
there was no one in that haunted room
there was no sign that any one had ever been in it
nothing seemed to have been touched
even the bed was undisturbed
even as be had refused to eat at our table so it seemed he had refused to sleep beneatli our roof
slowly painfully i stumbled down the stair
never had i felt so old and helpless and dismayed
patricia took my arm in the lower hall and for the first time in my life i was glad of a womans help
swnehow she got me to the telephone
after what seemed hours of fumblii i got bob shane the taxi driver on the wire
when had he taken the stranger back to town
but i never brought nobody out to palo alto he bawled in exasperation
nobody at all
old jude mustve gone plum loco
i brought out a small package that come by express an i left it with that old dumb nigger at the door the matter with the old hellion anyhow
i couldnot answer him
the receiver dropped from ray nerveless hand
i was sick but there was something i had to do
that box i gasped to patricia
quick got to find out what was in that box morna isnot down yet patricia objected
most of the young folks arenot
up late last night you know it makes no difference i mumbled got to find out patricia
i tell you weve got to find out i saw her own face whiten
i donot know whether her thougiit was the same as mine
i never did know for we never talked about it afterward
but she helped me back upstairs and down the hall to the room that was moma les
she didnot answer when we knocked and her door was locked
i had to send for some of the men to break it down
and then i wished i could have left it locked till judgment day
i can never get that picture from before my eyes
the opaline box lay on the night table by the bed
it was open and empty
morna lay cold and quiet in her bed
her white hands still gripped the wrist of a severed brown hand that clutched her throat in a desperate futile effort to wrench it away a brown hand that had once been part of a mayan maid who had loved and aided philip rice
and face that is what i would almost be willing to give my immortal soul to forget
but forget i cannot
and even as we stared spellbotind with horror the brown fingere relaxed their grip the hand fell to the pillow and lay still its work well done sherburne rice patricia was babbling h3f6terically over and over
the vegeance of sherburne rice but i was not so sure
i stood there thinking of the strange man who called himself minos dis the man who ate not and slept not in our house the man whom bob shane had not been able to see
and i remembered then that dis is another name for pluto the god of the nether world and that minos was one of the judges who rendered judgments there
perhaps but how could it be otherwise

author of corpses for witches ileen was just hanging up the dish towel on the rack beside the kitchen sirdc when she heard john car as it came into the driveway and stopped by the back door
a slightly annoyed look settled across the girls pretty face
john omarra alwa3rs made her feel strangely uneasy even more so of late
john with his heavy black brows and his habit of scowling at nothhig
he insisted he was loved pain it was the spirit of the devil the good irish folk said that infested and blackened the soul of lovely nancy gannon
for ntmcy smiled at the sight of blood and laughed when men died in agony and at times her strange heartnumhing joy drove her to dance naked the one shfh doom that was upon him in love wife eileen but when he came to see her he would often just sit there staring at nancy eighteen year old sister
eileen couldnot understand him but for some reason she was afraid of offending him by showing her uneasiness
she looked at the clock
it was just seven oclock in the evening early for callers even in blairfteld
quick footsteps sounded on the back porch and the kitchen door banged open
john omarra stood there for a moment breathing quickly
hello john
the girls hands went to her hair then smoothed the apron over her slim hips wasnot expecting you this evening come to see you this time eileen
john omarra made a quick nervous jerk with his head your dad
in the living room
a look of sudden alarm spread over the girls face happened wrong
plenty john omarra went through the small dinii room of the gannon home with eileen at his heels
paddy gannon father big and barrelchested with black hair that showed no sign of grey was sitting beside a table lamp reading his paper
his wife frail but brightlooking was knitting at the other side of the table
mr gannon raised his eyes looked at john face and let his paper drop to the floor
trouble eh johnny
yes sir
a cavein
eddie dwyer is trapped cavein
paddy voice became a growl
how could that happen
i looked that tunnel over just before sundown something very dirty going on johnny
he stamped out into the hall and got his hat
eileen went over and stood close to her mother
the two women watched with fearful eyes as paddy gannon opened the drawer of the living room table took out a white brassard and slipped it on his left arm
as they started out john omarra said got to get father doyle mr gannon ril see you at the shaft
is there a doctor there
yes sir
one of the boys got dr akers
the noise of paddy small car joined that of john for a moment behind the house
then they both roared out of the driveway tightened her arm around waist
trouble eileen darlin trouble
black days are upon us
working the mines in the dead of the night sneaking the coal out in trucks that donot turn on their engines until they reach the bottom of the hill
fights with the ccnpany men
now this secret society
the silents they call themselves
secret societies breed trouble
this is the third accident in two weeks
it seems as if a curse has been put on the blairfield mines eileen interrupted her mother
nancy
her mother blinked once or twice
nancy went out right after dinner
i suppose shes over at the house
eileen have you noticed anything strange about nancy of late sometimes the child frigjitens me bright blue eyes looked into her mothers tired grey ones and she caught her lip between her teeth
well you know how girls are when they reach eighteen always hard to understand at that e
but youre twentyone mrs gannon said
you didnot behave so strangely at her age
sometimes the womans voice dropped to almost a whisper sometimes i feel that shes not my own daughter at all
hush mother
eileen patted the older womans shoulder going out for a little while
do you mind
out
her mother glanced toward the window
but its starting to rain
where are you going up to the mine
now eileen donot go up there
you know your father wouldnot like it
they donot want the women up there especially when theres trouble
there will be a rough crowd up there and besides youll get drenched wear my slicker and rubbers and mind my own business eileen said keep out of their way
if you want anything before i come back neil is upstairs doing his home work isnot he
yes like a good boy
but i wish you wouldnot go wonot be long eileen was pulling on her raincoat adjusting a soft felt hat so it would deflect the rain from her face and neck
she opened the door on a nit that was black with a winddriven rain
there was a group of a score or so of men gathered armmd the mouth of the aft in the blairfleld coal mines
coal oil torches flared and sent out fitful downthfust flames hi the storm wind
the ring of faces around the entrance to the shaft was picked out in red and black lights and shadows
mostly men because the women had bn forbidden to come
eddie mother and sisters were there for it was eddie who was trapped in the tunnel
their faces were no less grimly expectant than those of the other watchers
paddy gannon and the doctor and priest were in the shaft with the shift that was trying to dig through to eddie dwyer
no word was spoken in the waiting huddle
off to one side on slight rise made by a dump pile two figures stood alone
the man was straight as a pine tree dressed in rags and his long snowwhite beard was spread out on his chest by the wind so that it looked like a white jacket
the girl was slender and she wore neither hat nor coat
her black hair airled in the rain and her thin dress was so wet it clung to her every contour revealing a figure beautifully and youthfully feminine
she had a lovely elfin face with large eyes that seemed to tilt up gently at the outer comers and her hair was blown back showing tiny ears that came to points at the edges
there was a strange expression on her face as she stood there beside the old man heedle of the elements watching the group around the shaft
she looked like a person who is witnessing a pageant of rare beauty
her lovely lips were half parted like a cliilds in front of a christmas tree
the old man just stood beside her still and without expression
standing there together they looked in the weird lit of the torches like the study of an inspired sculptor came up the skirted the group at the mouth of the mine shaft and climbed the little rise to where the girl and the old man were standing
she seized the girls arm
nancy
what are you doing here
standing in the rain widiout hat or coat better come home the whitebearded man turned his head once to look at eileen then looked away again
nancy gannon turned her lovely young face toward her sister oh eileen that a beautiful picture
those people huddled in the rain and torchlight with their faces hard with worry and sharp with pain waiting waiting
it is so beautiful it fills me with delight makes me want to run and leap and sing nancy
her sisters voice was brisk
eddie dwyer is trapped in tiiere
daddy is one of the men trying to get him out
he and the others might get cauglit in a cavein before they can reach eddie talking nonsense and youll catch your death of cold
come
come home with me at once
all right eileen naticy said slowly
i hate to leave such a lovely sht
good night seamus ocallahan
lovely like the little folk gathered around their fire waiting for one of their mates who has been trapped in the world and is late in coming
eileen twitched her sisters arm
keep still and hurry
they had gone a dozen paces or so when eileen said why do you talk to that old hermit seamus ocallahan
everyone knows hes crazy
people will talk if they see you with him like that been told before
seamus ocallahan is not crazy nancy said
he is a gentle and kind man with a sensitive soul
he sees beauty with eyes that others lack
he talks to me until too can see beauty
if i tell dad youve been talking to seamus ocallahan and calling it beautiful that eddie dwyer got trapped in the cavein hell take a strap to you even if you are eighteen
nancy shivered and started to walk faster
her voice had a quieter more normal pitch when she spoke this time wet through hurry
the two sisters were lying side by side in bed when they heard their fathers car come into the yard
they heard him stamp up the back steps into the kitchen
mrs gannon was up waiting for her husband with a pot of coffee on the stove
the girls could hear them talking in tlie kitchen right below the bedroom
did you get him out
mrs gannon asked
yes paddy gannon rumbled
we got him out too late
dead he was when we got to him
too late for priest or doctor
i tell you mary there is something very dirty about it all not natural like the place was bewitched
three accidents without any reason or cause one after tlie other
for all the world as if there was a black spell put on the place
black clouds dropped off to sleep to dream of the grim tableau at the mine
again she saw the huddle of anxious fearridden figures at the mouth of the shaft
no word or cry had been uttered at the shaft but eileen dreamed that somebody cried out sharply
the cry came again cut through tlie veil of sleep
it seemed still to echo in the quiet house when eileen sat up in bed fully awake
nancy moved restlessly by her side but did not answer when eileen spoke to her
eileen leaned close and saw her sisters eyes were shut and that she breathed like a person in a deep sleep
this time the noise was a frightened wliimper and it came from the next room
eileen slipped out of bed and pulled on her robe
as she went through the door to her young brothers room she switched on the light
neil her ten year old brother was sitting up in bed his eyes round discs of fright
he was still whimpering
what is it neil
eileen approadied tlie boys bed
he looked at her without answering
paddy gannon came thumping into the room in his bare feet wearing an old fashioned flannel night shirt this
was that you screaming son donot know the boy said slowly donot know if i screamed but i was asleep and it was like as if somebody was holding a light over me
then somebody slapped my face hard three or four times
then the light seemed to go out and i woke up
bad dreams
mr gannon scoffed
too much sweet stuff on your stomach
no the boy protested
somebody was really slapping me
i can still feel my face sting
eileen leaned over the boys bed
yes dad
his face is red just as if he had been slapped
red and white welts
wrinkles in the pillow mr gannon rumbled
go back to sleep neil and donot let me hear any more out of you
you frightened 3ur mother out of a sound sleep
the hoy put his hand gingerly to the side of his face then slowly lay back
yes sir turned and went back to her room
she switched on the small bed lamp for a ond
the faint smell of hot wax came to her nostrils
there was a candle in a pewter stick on the bedside table purely an ornament
but there was a little pool of melted wax around the wick
the wick when she touched it was still warm
the candle was on side within easy reach of her hand
eileen stood there looking down at her sister with a strange halffrightened expression
but lovely faunlilffi face was wreathed in an innocent sleep smile
the neck of her nightdress was awry ahowmg the white throat and the of her breast
half child half woman all lovely
slowly shaking her head eileen crawled back into her side of their bed
nb no
it couldnot have been nancy
she wouldnot have done tliat
but his face was streaked
and that candle was lighted only a short while ago oh no
not my sister nancy unthinkable the next evening nancy was not home for dinner and the gannons sat down without her
prom time to tune paddy gannon looked at the clock and demanded sourly nancy keeping her donot know mrs gannon said at length
she must be over at the i canot think of where dse she could iie
paddy gannon finished his second cup of coffee and thumped his napkin down on the table going after her
what kind of conduct does she call that not commg trame to meals staying out by herself after dark wandering around
it seems you havenot taught your second daughter the things she should know mary time i took a hand
he filled his pipe put on his hat and coat and stamped out
oh dear mrs gannon breathed fearfully hope she is at i do hope she is eileen patted her mothers shoulders reassuringly but there was a serious cast to her pretty face as she carried the dishes into the kitchen
mr gannon had not yet returned when paul savage came to see eileen
he was a slim goodlooking young man with a rather solemn expression
he dressed mudh better than most of the yoimg men of blairfield
he was in the living room talking to mrs gannon when neil came out to the kitchen where his sister eileen was putting away the silver
that paul savage is cnit in the parlor waiting for you neil said
you donot like him do you neil
eiken smiled
aw hes a dude
i like john omarra
why donot you marry johnny omarra sis rular and hes a big shot in the silents
sshf eileen put her finger to her lips
you shouldnot talk about that
you know it
huh neil muttered
everybody knows who the silents are one of them why he donot like a company man like paul savage coming around to see you
he likes johnny omarra too
you keep still eileen warned him
or youll get yourself in trouble
she took off her apron and went into the living room paul savage rose from his chair
when he smiled he looked much younger
would you and your nujther like to go to the movies he asked
no mrs gannon quickly added
thank you paul but i want to wait for mr gannon
you and eileen go
come out in the kitchen paul eileen said want to show you something in the kitchen eileen closed the door and faced the young man
paul terribly worried about nancy where dad is now out looking for her
i want to wait until he gets back been acting awfully strange of late
paul took her hand
eileen why donot you stop worrying about your silly sister and listen to me
i want to marry you eileen call her silly please eileen begged really worried
as long as you must talk about her paul said all right
people are beginning to notice that shes well different the prettiest girl around not counting you of course
yet she scares the fellows away because she never wants to do the ordinary things
she wants them to go out and run in the rain with her instead of going to the movies
she doesnot talk like anybody in blairfield
she could have any young man in town if she stopped being like that
what are people saying about her
eileen asked
paul savage shrugged
oh i donot listen to gossip you interested in sweet paul
but worried
oh heres dad now car came into the yard and stofd at the side of the house
the front door opened and eileen and paul could hear mr voice
well i found her mrs gannon said mildly where have you been nancy dear drove all over town looking for her paddy gannon growled
and where do you think i found her
in the grave yard where
i was driving past slow thinking and worrying and i heard laugh
i hopped the fence and there she was sitting on a tombstone in the dark by the side of a newly filled grave talking to crazy old seamus ocallahan
the two of them perched there on a headstone for all the world like two ghouls
and crazy old seamus telling her mad stories about the little folk and the banshee and the leprechauns fairy stories well now mrs gannon said placatingly a great many people aroimd here who still believe those things and youd not call them crazy
you said yourself there was a black curse on the blairfield mines
if there are evil spirits why canot there be hold your tongue woman paddy gannon made a threatening gesture toward his wife
nancy stood there watchii and listening with a sort of pleased smile on her lovely young face
mrs gannon made a helpless little gesture and stopped talking
i troubles enough
gannon demanded
trouble getting the coal out
trouble with accidents that donot look like accidents at ail
trouble with the company and the men
and then my fine young daughter spends hgr time in the evening in the graveyzud talking to a mad hermit old enough to have done with that childish stuff nancy
look at you
why youre youre a woman
old seamus tells such lovely stories nancy said sweetly
if i catch you talking to him again take the strap to you gannon thundered take the back of my hand to you in the public street grown and all as you are
no nancy said softly beat me
you would be very unlucky the rest of your days if you were to strike me kind of talk is this
gaanon bellowed
he took three quick strides to pass between the table and his wifes chair to reach his daughter
his foot caught in the electric lamp cord swept the lamp off the table to crash heavily on the floor
in falling it had missed mrs gannon by bare inches
gannon stood there with the wrecked lamp at his feet and for a second his face was purple
then the anger seemed to go out of him
that almost hit you mary he told his wife sorry for my clumsiness
nancy looked from her father to her mother and her face was calm and sweet going upstairs to bed
in tile kitchen eileen gannon turned to paul savage
you heard it
sitting on a headstone in the graveyard listening to a crazy hermit tell stories
paul so worried about tier
it isnot tliat she herself is crazy sure just that some times she isnot nancy at all
mother and dad donot inrow how to handle her afraid its up to me wish i could help paul said
but shes your sister
i wouldnot be much ure afraid
mr gannon came into the kitchen stopped dead when he saw paul savage
hahl so youre here are you
good evening mr gannon you company men gannon said deliberately are all pleased to hear that eddie dwyer died in a cavein
you donot understand mr gannon paul explained only work for the company but i know how they feel
they know go in there and take out coal and ip it out quietly by trucks
they know you have armed guards stand there while the men work
they could call in other armed guards and cause bloodshed
they donot because of the men in blairfield worked in the mines for yrars and will work there again when things open up
but you work those shafts at your own risk
you know that mr gannon
there has been a lot of mysterious trouble lately gannon said suppose the company doesnot know about that either the company doesnot want trouble paul insisted
when hotheads like john omarra get excited they blame everything on the company
johnny omarra is loyal to his own kind gannon said sharply a trouble maker paul answeral firmly
things are bad enough without men like omarra keeping things stirred up
if youre interested to know gannon said slowly look with more favor on johnny omarra than on another who was raised in blairfield and went away and got a fine education and came back to work for the company against ids own kind know you mean me paul said do work for the company
so did you for years as a mine foreman
and when things pick up youll be working for them again unless there is serious trouble not sol gannon exploded
the company never intends to work blairfield again and they hate to see us scrape a few dollars out of it to keep from starving
paul savage shrugged keep a check on johnny omarra mr gannon getting too big for his pants let him get you into an rthing youll be sorry for
from outside came the rattle of a noisy car coming into the driveway think thats john now eileen said
please donot start any unpleasaiitness
john omarra came in tlie back door said good evening to mr gannon and eileen and nodded curtly to paul savage
he stood there awkwardly for a moment
then his heavy black brows drew down and he said mr gannon could i speak to you alone what i have to say is ncrf for the ears of company spies
come with me gannon invited
they left the kitchen and went into the living room
johnny was just one of the boys working in the mine when things were good paul said meditatively
now with all this trouble hes getting to be a person of consequence
the men defer to him and your father alike
if your father doesnot watch out hell be taking orders from johnny omarra yet
trouble
eileen put her hands to her temples
the air is heavy witli it like watching a black cloud come rolling over the horizon
she shivered
who walks at night was sound asleep when eileen retired
the older sister stood looking at the younger girl for several moments before putting out the light face was so sweet and childishly free from lines
the black hair clustered around her temples and the lashes curled smudgeblack against the warm whiteness of her cheek
eileen bent and kissed her sisters forehead very gently
in sleep lips curved
eileen stretched out beside her sister but sleep was reluctant to come
she shifted position constantly but did it gently so as not to disturb nancy
eventually she dozed off a fitful tense sort of halfoblivion instead of a sound relaxed slumber
suddenly she snapped out of her halfconscious state and sat bolt upright in bed
she reached over and tried to touch nancy
the other half of the bed was empty i smothering a frightened exclamation eileen switched on thebed light
her sister nancy was gone eileen sat there hands to her temples trying to think coherently
the house was silent as a tomb
if she started to look for nancy it would wake her father and mother
then if nancy had left the house there would be a terrific scene
paddy gannon would go looking for his daughter and when he found her hed give her a horrible beating
not since they were children had their father struck either of them
but eileen knew if her father discovered nancy had left the house a black rage would get the best of him
eileen covered her own face with her hands
no no
i wonot wake them just wait and pray come back
she must come back
a that dragged like a prison sentence then the clatter of a car a thximping on the front door
eileen bounded from bed snatched her robe and ran down the stairs her heart pounding
something has happened
something has happened to nancy
her fingers groped for the light switch and then fumbled with the front door latch
she had to cling to the door jamb to keep from surrendering to her trembling knees and folding up on the floor
john omarra pushed in his dark face pale and his eyes bright with a strange frightened look your dad
in bed eileen stammered
is something wrong
did something happen to get him up
john facial muscles jerked as he said each word
what goes on down there
paddy gannon bellowed from the stair head
john omarra
come down for sake john shouted
the shaft is haunted
i saw it with my own eyes
joe dixon and i were on the second level waiting for the bucket when all of a sudden joe says in a scared voice look
i looked and saw something white gliding toward us from the tunnel
joe let a yell out of him and stepped back and fell down the shaft killed
i fired a shot right at the ghost but it just disappeared
you must be drunk or crazy no
i saw it
joe saw it too and thats what made him fall
while we were getting body out another one of the boys saw it
a white thing tliat seemed to floatalong in the dark tunnel
none of the boys will go back in the shaft get dressed and be right with you paddy gannon said
eileen stood downstairs in the hall clutching her robe around her
what did it look like this thing you saw
could it have been a woman or a girl
no
it was nothing human i tell you
i fired right at it
you shot it voice was unsteady
and it disappeared where
just disappeared john repeated
into the blackness of the shaft
mr gannon came clumping down the stairs his shoes not yet laced
he grabbed his hat and coat
haunted his voice was scornful think you were bach hi the dark ages in ireland
after they had gone eileen crept back upstairs to bed
she was trembling so she had to grasp the banister with both hands as she made the ascent
once in her room she threw herself face down on the bed
once more the house was very pounding of her own heart boomed in her ears
nancy gone
a white figure in the mine a ghost
joe dixon hurtling to his death john omarra shooting point blank at the white figure
nancy gone
the words and thoughts flooded her mind in a confused and terrible jumble
she was afraid as she had never before known fear
not fear of a known thing something tangible you see and understand and fight off but a heartchilling terror of some unknown menace she awoke the sun was streaming in her window and the little clock on the bedside table said six
she turned quickly
nancy was lying there beside her breathing regularly sleeping like a child
maybe it was all a horrible dreamt then she saw a red smear on the bed sheet that covered shouders
she drew back the covers white nightgown was torn at tire right shoulder and under the tear a crimson groove marred the flawless skin
not deep but raw and angry looking
it might have been made by the branch of a tree run into in the dark
it might have been made by the lash of a whip or the sting of a speeding bullet as it grazed its mark eileen went quietly into the bathroom and got the iodine bottle eyes opened as the strong antiseptic seared the red flesh of the wound
she looked up at her sister and smiled sweetly
it doesnot hurt much nancy
eileen leaned over her
where have you been darling
what happened to your shoulder have been asleep right here beside you nancy murmured drowsily
and i had lovely dreams
red lights in the dark underground and yellow lights and mens faces reflected
and one face so frightened the mans soul was stamped on it like the brand of a whitehot iron
it was lovely
then she closed her eyes again and slept
eileen threw back the covers bare feet were bruised and soiled with a thick black dirt
like coal dust
gently eileen covered her sister and tiptoed from the she had to get out into the air out and walk in the ainshine
she couldnot talk to her mother or father or little bner about diis evincreasing fear tliat was seeping into her bones
she left die house and walked quickly takii breaths as she reached main street she saw little groups of people standing about talking excitedly
only one or two of the stor had opened as yet but there were more people on the sidewalks than was usual at notm
they nodded a good morning to eileen as she passed then turned to rume their fevered discussion
in front of the drug store there was a larger group
eileen stopped and edged into the fringe around an old woman who was talking in a hi thin cackle and holding her listeners spellbound
the first sentence eileen heard made her heart and still
bewitched i yes
you donot believe it heh but you must believe now
i remember sixty years o when leadville was bewitched things happened and men dropped dead at their work
the whole town soon frit the curse
men were afraid to work and they couldnot get any money
when they found the witeh they burned her
then they could work again
blairfield is bewitched
no man will set foot in that haunted shaft
blarrfield is doomed
doomed
a bystander echoed the word stupidly
yes ckiomed to waste and die
doomed unless you find the witch
eileen caught her lip between her teeth to stifle a cry and walked quickly away
as she walked the words kept echoing in her mind
find the witch
find the witch the people of blairfield were simple close to the soil
many of them were only one generation removed from the peasants of an old eoimtry whose lor was woven around strange tales of little folk and fairies and leprechauns handed down from the time of the so strongly a part of their consciousness that centuries of christianity could not eradicate it
none among them would deny in his own heart that certain families had a banshee an evil spirit that wailed outside the house three nighls running whei a member of that family was marked for death
they prayed to god imt over their shoulders their eyes were peeled and their ears attuned to another groups of spirits that recognized neither god nor man
dancers la the forest family was seated at the dinner table that night waiting for the head of the house to come home eyes kept straying across the taide to study the face of her sister nancy
mrs gannon looked tired and nervous and little ten year old neil was chattering aboirt the topic that was the paramount subject of conversation in every home in blairfield
haunted little neil piped his eyes round
the mines haunted and nobody dasnot go near it
the ghost will strike tlrem down dead
neil voice was not quite steady go around repeating such nonseiise
cackling old women txy to explain everything by blaming it cm the spirits
you wait until dad comes home and ask him
but they do say that all over town mrs gantion offered not just the old women the men too
the young men
johnny omarra was one who saw the apparition and hes not a kd to be easily frightened
boyl neil exploded
johnny omarra yanks out his gun and hang
the old ghost neil stop please eileen cut him short
her eyes probed face for the barest sign of a reaction
she even engaged glance switched to look at right shoulder then back meaningfully to her sisters face
but the play of glances seemed to mean nothing to nancy
she just sat tlaere her small face in repose her large eyes that slanted up a bit at the outer edges dark blue pools of innocence
paddy gannon came into the house with a bang of the door and a noisy clump of his big boots
he marched through the diningroom to wash at the kitchen sink
through the splash of the water his voice carried through to the family in the next room
mary you get ready and get neil ready to take the eight oclock train for reading in the morning going to stay with your sister for a few days that paddy
mary gannon asked in a startled voice
aw gee
dad neil protested wanna stay here and see what happens about the ghost oh you do mr gannon stamped in and took his place at the head of the table going to reading with your mother young one
and hear no more of your lip
he turned to his wife get ready
this is no place for kids or women with weak hearts
do you know what the whole towns talking about saying the mine is haunted the spirits who are to blame for the trouble show them whos to blame they wonot go near the shaft and you know what that means
starvation that will come so quick we wonot have the strength to pull ourselves out of the way to die
haunted it may be by all the evil spirits in hell but well work it just the same
and there will be bad days
so you and neil go stay with your sister
why canot we all go
mrs gannon asked plaintively nothing here now but a bare living made by sneaking out coal in the dead of night
trouble all the time
secret societies and wearing white bands on your arms so you wonot shoot down your neighbor not ever coming back paddy
blairfield is cackling like the old wives in the village eh gannon barked
do as i say
eileen and nancy can look after me and the house and look after the mine haunted or not
serve the food mary was a tension a harsh discordant note that seemed to vibrate in the air imlike the usual harmonious home life of the mrs gannon looked scared and her hands trembled visibly
even little neil appeared to sense the change the sinister feeling of foreboding that hung in the room like a fog
his strident young voice was dropped to a hushed whisper
as eileen studied the guikless smile on her younger sisters face a cold chill raced down her spine and the small hair prickled on the back of her neck
it was nancy not the talk of the haunted mine who had by some strange means deliberately charged the air with an ominous portent and she was enjoying the result
her smile said so
nancy eileen called sharply look like that
stop it nancy looked at her sister and smiled even more sweetly
eileen clenched her hands until the fingers were numb and shut her mouth tight
she mustnot let this wild spirit of discord that suddenly permeated the house draw her into its whirlpool
why did nancy delight in making people afraid
eileen excused herself and went into the kitchen
it seemed that smile had a slightly derisive quality as she watched her sister leave the room
that evenhig paul savage came to call
mrs gannon was upstairs with neil getting ready for their visit to reading
mr ganncwi had gone out wearing the white brassard of tlie silents on his arm
nancy was sitting on the front steps watching a full moon come up to paint the countryside with quidtlver
paul and eileen sat side by side in the living room
paul covered the girls hand with his
eileen wlqr do you keep putting me off
is it of omarra
my mind is filled with other things paul
terrible disturbing things
some baleful influence seems to have settled over all of ns know paul said heard the talk thats going on around town
that the mine is haunted and all that rot
but its dangerous talk more powerful than any sensible propaganda
we know there arenot any ghosts in that shaft but as long as people think so youll get no sense out of them
anything is apt to result from a wild story like that
i even went down the shaft myself looking for tlw ghost
but nobody can prove it isnot haunted eileen said know i shouldnot believe those fantastic stories but there are a numbo of things i donot want to believe been fighting them off rejecting them as impossible but they persist and terribly worried
i canot even tell you paul what tliey are
it would be better if you did paul coaxed gently
eileen shook her head and ttiey sat for a moment or two in silence holding hands
the girl started suddenly and a dliill tremor ran through her frame
prom somewhere outside came a weird half human cry a wail that lingered like the echo of a soul in torment fingers locked around hand
what what was that
some dog baying at the full moon paul smiled
no
eileen turned a tense face toward paul
no
i heard it last night too
just hl that
paul got to tell somebody she jumped to her feet
nancy
she was outside sitting on the front steps admiring the full moon paul said guess shes still there
eileen ran for the front door and flung it open
the moon drenched the oountiyside with a wan mysterious light
the front steps were carpeted in its glow but they were empty
nancy was not out there
eileen stood by the door and called several times
paul came out and stood by her side
suddenly she turned to him
paul we must find her she seized his lapels with both hands
we must find nancy
but where did she go
paul asked
where will we look
eileen started down the steps digging paul after her by the hand
come quickly got to find her
paul where does old seamus ocalahan live
you know the strange hermit in the woods beyond the ridge some place
paul said
but you donot tliink nancy would be there do you oh i donot know but lets try
if you only knew what afraid of stumbled through the woods climbing the slope to the ridge where old seamus ocalahan was believed to live in a cave
the bright moon made their path easy to find but haste made her feet unsteady
at the end of twenty minutes she paused to get her breadi and leaned weakly against paul savage
nancy paul dear
i canot even tlxink of you until i find out whats wrong with her
paul patted her shoulder understandingly help all i can darling
a little farther on they came to a clearing the grass silvered like the surface of a lake by the moonlight
paul seized hand held her fast
look eileen stood there by side in the sliadow of the rim of trees and blinked her eyes unbelievingly at what slie saw in the clearing
old seamus ocalahan was standing straight as a graven image in the center of the clearing the moon making his long white beard a cascade of silver
two figures danced around him in a wide circle one following the motions and gyrations of the other
both figures were snow white
one was a beautiful young girl nude as a nymph of tiae forest
the other was a great white goat
the goat was dancing on its hind legs pawing with its front ls as a dancer keeps the rhythm with his hands and arms
nancy voice was a choked whisper
yes paul said slowly
nancy
eileen started forward but he held her back
wait he said marvelous barbaric beautiful eileen tried to break away from him
paul are you crazy too my sister nancy dancing out there naked in the moonlight dancing with a goat in front of a crazy old man
paul got to stop her
wait
paul held her his eyes gripped by the strange sight
graceful as birds on the wing smooth and supple as fish gliding in water the goat and the girl danced in a smaller circle each time closing in around the still erect figure of the old man with the silver hair and beard
as they watched a strange music seemed to come from nowhere a lovely pulsing rhythm that was part of the dance and the moonlight barely audible faint but clearly defined
paul
eileen begged
let me stop her let her do that mad pagan dance there without any clothes in the moonlight
reluctantly paul walked by side as they left the fringe of trees and started across the clearing
old seamus ocalahan unfolded his arms and clapped his hands once
the faint music stopped
the great white goat dropped to all fours and trotted off int the woods
nancy stood there unashamed in her natural state and watched them approach
eileen stood before her sister probing her face
nancy smiled
it was beautiful she said it beautiful
where are your clothes
eileen demanded
qothes
oh yes
nancy walked straight and poised as a yoimg goddess to the edge of the wood where her clothes lay in a heap
paul savage his eyes still filled with the wonder and beauty of it touched old seamus ocalahzm on the arm
the music where was it coming from the old whitebearded man spread his arms
it is always there all around us
it only grows louder when we need it
eileen holding her sister by the hand was calling paul hurry go home please
paul joined the two sisters and they started off through the woods in the direction of home
eileen was sobbing audibly
nancy was walking proudly gracefully
once at a tight comer of the path nancy turned her head and looked up at paid
she smiled sweetly the moonlight showing every contour of her lovely young face
it was like a childs no more selfconsdous than when he had seen her doing the naked pagan dance a short time lack
paul looked back over his shoulder
the clearing was still there like a pool in the moonlight
but the old man with the silver hair and beard was gone
gone too was the great white dancing goat
but a dark figure appeared at the far edge of the clearhig
a man was cutting across the edge of the clearing toward the deme woods
the moon was so bright patd had no difficulty john burly figure with its characteristic truculent stride
now did that bird come from paul asked himself
was he hiding at the far side of ffie clearing all ffie time nancy was dancing he must have been
why should he hide and sneak away after i think its about time i told eileen a few things i know about that lad
hurry paul please eileen called from down the path frightened turned and hurried to catch up with the two sisters
they were almost home when a noise on the path behind them made paul turn to look
coming toward them plainly visible in the light of the moon was an old woman
she moved quickly despite her hunched shoxdders and bent frame
a grey shawl with bng fringe covered her head and the upper half of her body
as she approached made a cackling noise and strudc the ground before her with her cane
as the path was narrow and the old woman evidently in a hurry paul stood aside to let her pass
the old woman passed him without a glance and stamped up even with nancy and eileen
ha her shrill tackle awoke echoes in the wood
the her bony finger was extended toward nancy almost toucliing the girls face with its hooked nail
nancy stopped walking and looked at the crone with a halfpitying expression
eileen pushed the old woman away
go away you crazy old idiot ever call my sister that name
she is
she is
the old woman beat the ground with her stick was there at her birth
your mother knows she is a cfangeling
i have smi her with old seamus ocalaban laughing at tragedy sitting on headstones in the graveyard i saw her tonight when she danced with the goat in front of that old hewitch seamus ocalahan no cliild born of woman
and faring bad luck and sudden death to them as lives with her and are dose to her
savage took some money from his pocket and pressed it into the old womans hand you didnot see a thing
take this and get good and drunk and have yourself some more hallucinations
she closed her bony talons over the money held it close to her face to look then shuffled off bobbing her head
paul turned to the two girls wait a little while and let her get a start half crazy lialf drunk
you mustnot feel hurt at what she said nancy was just thinking nancy said softly
how odd and tlirilling it would be to find out one was a diangeling
not the cliild of mortal woman but an ageless spirit that comes back to the earth every century or so
stop it nancy voice was hoarse talk like that being silly the natural daughter of your mother and mine my very own sister and i wonot have any crazy old hag calling you things like that
from far up the path as if she had heard came the old crones voice crying out in a brittle caclde changeling changdingt cdl of the bandiee residents of blairfield were frightened
something had happened to call a curse down upon them that was unanimously agreed mine tlmt pirt food in their mouths and clothes on their backs was haunted bewitched
the curse was reaching out to envelop them all
soon the pinch of want would be added to the vague apprehension of the curse of the mine
no more trucks rolled at night
paddy gannon talked himself hoarse at a meeting of the silents but not one man among them would join him to enter the shaft
not even johnny omarra
for johnny had seen the specter with his own eyes
the women folk backed their men go near that shaft tis cursed and be sure of that and an old crone leaning on a crooked stick and holding her fringed shawl around her bent shoulders with taloned bands shuffled up and down the street stopped at stores and houses
everywhere she cackled the same awesome story
there was a changeling in their midst a thing in human form not a child of woman but a creature of the spirit world walked among them daily
posing as paddy own daughter it was
but no natural daughter at all at all
a changeling paddy gannon heard the gossip and took his pretty daughter by the hand
he brought nancy around to father house and held his broad thumb on the priests bell imtil an aged housekeeper opened the door
is his reverence in
gannon demanded like to see him if he is
yes
the old housekeeper was hesitant donot know see me sure
gannon pushed in still holding nancy by the hand
he walked into the hall and a gentle voice called from the front room
in here paddy gannon
the shades were drawn and the room was in darkness
gannon halted on the threshold
are you in the dark father afraid i am paddy gannon father doyle said gently few hours ago i lost the sight of my eyes
dr akers was here and will be back
there seems to be no reason for it
but i am blind
enough of that then
can i do something for you blind
paddy booming voice dropped to a whisper
god preserve your eyes father
but brought my daughter nancy a cruel rumor going around
the people are saying my daughter here is a changeling
what can we do to stop this terrible talk
come here my child father doyle said
can you see me in the dark
give me your hand
there
you arenot going to let this cruel talk make you bitter or envious are you because we know there is no such thing
there is only one spirit and that a benevolent only man is cruel and wicked
oh i donot mind
father nancy said sweetly think it would be thrilling to be a spirit not bound by the shackles of this earth
all youth feels tlmt way my child the priest said
now go outside please
i want a word with your father
after a moment the priest asked has she left the room paddy gannon
yes father
she moves so lightly one might well believe her to be a spirit father doyle said with a smile in his voice
send her away paddy gannon to a good convent some place in the country where live and growing things aboimd
the good sisters will know what to do to shape that nimble mind without breaking her spirit
but send her away because these good people of blairfield can be very cruel word went aroimd that paddy gannon had taken his daughter nancy to see the priest to have father doyle drive out the devil that possessed her
but before he got there father doyle had gone blind the devil had closed the eyes of god even on the street now people talked in awed whispers
nancy gannon walked down the main street and people stopped as if turned to stone at her approach
mothers pulled their little children out of the way as if the devil htmsdf was abroad
even the seemed to sense the fearful isolation and slunk out of her way
in the old days they told each other she would have been driven out of town as a witch
maybe even burned of it had no effect on nancy
she walked as if in a world of her own and her very manner of goit whipped tlie people mto a frenzy of hate
she was no real daughter of paddy and mary gannon
she was a child of the devil and the curse that held blairfield in its grasp was her doing
nancy went her way smiling sweetly a faraway look on her lovely elfin face
eileen gannon was tearful and more than a little frightened as she talked to paul savage
what can i do paul the whole town is calling nancy a spawn of some evil spirit vicious stupid peasants
paul growled
but paul eileen stammered
she does such ttrate things you can hardly uame them
she sneaks out at night and meets seamus ocalahan
she was there when the cavein killed eddie dwyer
the night the ghost was seen in the shaft and joe dixon fell to his death she was gone all night and in the morniag her feet were bruised and black and she had a strange wound in her shoulder
maybe this crazy old man has something to do with these awful events
maybp he is influencing nancy to do things that are connected in some way with these tragedies
seamus ocalahan is a bit cradeed paul told her
but hes not the one to bring the tremble that holds this community in its grip right now a theory of my own
and donot worry about nancy a rare and lovely creature
sucli grace and beauty to be bom and reared in blairfield stop it
eileen screamed
ever since you saw her dancing naked in the moonlight youve done nothing but stare at her and follow her with your eyes it bad enough that my own sister is bewitched but you have to fall under her spell eileen youre hysterical show you please go
eileen begged canot stand any more come back ever
you you too are coming under the spell
i can see it feel it
go for keeps and forever
first she bewitched john omarra now its you
you need a little rest paul said see you tomorrow
no eileen slammed the door beloind him and leaned weng against the wall
never come back
there wonot be any tomorrow
paddy gannon was talking to a group of grimfaced naen at a meeting of the he was using strong words in a strong voice
were they going to sit down and wait for starvation
were they going to let their wives and kids starve with good coal ready for the pick because some old crones had said there was a curse on the mine going in there tonight he shouted
and going to get coal
and if theres a man amotg you with the guts of a louse hell go with me and the rest of you can stay home and tell your beads and starve like rats when he climbed the hill a little later fifteen men were ijehind him
others were getting the trucks still others carried rifles and sidearms to stand guard while the shift worked stood in her room with her back to the door and watched her sister nancy get rdy for bed
when the younger girl had retired eileen turned the key in the door and began to undress going to sleep beside me arenot you eiken nancy asked
yes of course
eileen tried to keep her voice steady
why not everyone else is afraid of me
everyone in the world
mother took neil away and father wonot stay in the house
the people in town draw away from me but you arenot the least bit frightened are you
of comse not
eileen was trembling
she got into bed and reached out to extinguish the bed light but halted her hand
it is strange to see fear on peoples faces nancy said
it gives one an exultant what would make you twist your face in fear eileen
the younger sister moved close and looked into eyes
eileen steded herself against showing any emotion
she tried to smile at her sister
suddenly there came the weird halfhuman cry she had heard on tlie two previous nights
it seemed to oome from the ard outside the house
its gliastly timbre swmed to run up and down her spine like needles as it climbed the register to a wail of torment
she sat bolt upright in bed that
nancy laughed gleefully your eyes showed fear stark uncontrollable fear
your naked terrified soul was in your eyes the way a person looks when death stares them in the face
it is marvelous thrilling
she edged close to eileen
soon i shall see that look in your eyes again
i know it soon
but tliat oise eileen muttered
that dreadful sound
ihe banshee nancy shrilled nights it has wailed
and that means death
she bounded oat of bed and stood on her bare toes as if poised for flight
her head was thrown hack her eyes alight with rapture
the eileen covered her face with her hands then by sheer force of will pulled them away and looked at the weird tableau of her sister standing with outstretched arms head thrown back
for a split second it looked to eileen as if a huge white bat wings spread stood there instead of nancy
resolutely she got out of bed and approached nancy
go back to bed nancy hysterical but sfie couldnot keep her voice levd and the nerves in her body tingled so that she walked jerkily
nancy lowered her iiead and stared at her sister then as eileen drew close arms came out toward her went around shoulders
tense and shaken eileen went a little limp
as she sagged she felt fingers slide up and close around her throat
through a haze she heard voice have heard the banshee call
i must go
when eileen recovered from her faint nancy was gone
death ia a nymph responded at once to frantic call
as he drew up to the front of the house in his small car eileen was standing on the porch
she ran down the steps and seized arm in her two hands
nancy has gone again
we must find her
do you know where she went
no
but lets try the mine
paul she acted like a mad persott
we must find her and bring her back
all right
paul started the car
but its dangerous to be sneaking around the mine at this hour of the night
the men are working up there and theyll shoot on sight know it eileen said in hushed tones
she only had her nightgown on
if she goes up there they might think it has something to do with the ghost that is supposed to be haunting it
they might kill her in the darkness before they see who it is
hurry please
you know how excited they all are
right
paul savage guided his car out of the village and up the hill to the dark shaft of the blairfield mine
he took a short cut over a bumpy road as they neared the top of the rise
as they bounced around a curve his headlights picked out something that flashed white in the darkness
he stood on his brakes
what was that
it was nancy eileen gasped sure it was
over there by that wooden shack
paul savage took a flashlight from the pocket of the car and got out
come on he told eileen
that shack is an air vent to number one tunnel soon see if that was nancy
the two left the car and ran across the field to the little wooden shack
it was unlocked and paul directed the beam of his flashlight inside as he swung the door open
the grating that covered the hole inside was leaning against the wooden side of the little shanty tell me paul said slowly
she couldnot have gone down that vent she must have
eileen insisted saw her come in here
paid knelt and played his light down the vent a hole about four feet in diameter roughly shored with heavy planking
there are footholds in this thing he said
but i still canot imagine she went down there
eileen insisted gone down there where the men are working see her white nightgown in the dark and shoot her
paul weve got to go down and find her another one they donot want around here paul said ruefully think i was spying for the company and give me the business but here goes go down first and give you a light
he switched tlie light off and let himself down the vent feeling with hands and feet for the iron footholds that had been driven into the shoring
the vent sloped off around hard rock and was narrower at that point
then it widened again
eventually his feet struck hard surface
he flashed his light again and saw that he was nr the end of a tunnel
above him he could hear progress down the vent shaft
he played the light for her and the two of them stood in the tunnel black as the coal it sired except for flashlight
she must have gone this way paul said
come on was a narrow gauge track along the floor of the tunnel and the footing was imcertain so paul kept the light on the ground before them
they approached a bay and paul stopped suddenly
did you hear flut noise
yes
what was h voice was a hushed whisper
the men are working number three vein the next below on this shaft paul told her about one hundred and fifty feet down
the vein below that is flooded because the pump hasnot been kept going
they must have stopped working because the lift bucket isnot moving
but that noise eileen repeated
it seemed to come from right ahead in the tunnel know paul said
and nobody is working up on this level
maybe its nancy
come on
he led her out to the bay and around the shaft
there was no indication that a score of men were working right below them
the vein ran off at a tangent on the other side of the bay
eileen stuck close to paul and walked with one hand extended touching his back
it smells very unpleasantly she said
almost gagging
they are working without the exhaust blowers to dean out the foul air paul told her
clean air comes down the shaft but even at best its hard to exhaust the had air
these men are taking chances but its diat or starve thats why my sympathies he stopped talking and his frame stiffened
standing bdiind him with her hand touching his back eileen knew from his abrupt tenseness that they had suddenly come upon something in that dark underground tunnel
he stood there with the light directed straight in front of him
eileen moved so she could see around him
he tried to stop her by an upfiung arm but she had already seen
propped tip against the wall of the vein in a half sitting posture was big paddy gannon father
he was still as the blackhewn wall behind him and his eyes were wide open and staring staring up at them
paul held the light on the man sitting there so limp and like a collapsed figure in a wax museum
dad eileen was on her knees before him happened wrong
hold the light
paul gave the girl the flashlight and moved her gently to one side
he knelt beside the slumped form of big paddy gannon and felt for a pulse
then he placed liis ear against chest and listened for a heartbeat
but he knew from the touch of him that gannon was dead
his flesh was already cold clay although rigor mortis had not yet set in
he put bis hand behind shoulders in an effort to straighten the grotesque figure
his hand felt something wet and sticky
as he pulled it away and looked at it in the flashlights beam he saw it was covered with blood
eileen saw it too
she let out a pitiful litde cry and dropped the light
paul turned quickly and reached for her in the dark to catch her as she fell
she went limp in his arms
gently he lowered her to the ground and began to fumble around for the flashlight but it dudcd his groping fingers
paul straightened up and his fingers were unsteady as he probed his pockets for matches
there was no warning sound but suddenly a light seemed to flash at the back of his head
the darkness spun before liim in a dizzy cone
he could feel hhnsdf falling losing consciousness
it was as if the roof of the vein had fallen in on him
as he slipped into oblivion his last thought was so this is what a cavein is like regained her senses slowly
size was coughing and gagging and the darkness was around her like a tiiick black blanket
she began to strule to her feet as she remembered the events just before she had fainted
she was in the coal vein with paul looking for nancy and they had found her father dead
and there had been blood on hand as he pulled it away from her fathers body
she snapped alert
utter and complete silence esaept for the regular drip of water somewhere
paul
she callal quietly at first
then as the only response was the chokedoff echo of her own frightened voice she called again louder
still no response and she screamed his name again and again only to have it beat back at her like the mocking taunt of a hundred fiends hidden in the blackness
her head turned first one way then another trying to make out some object
in one direction she thought she caught the flicker of a light
she stumbled over the rough floor of the tunnel toward the gleam of lht
the narrowgauge track tore one shoe off but she stumbled on unheeding
the tunnel made a turn and her hands fumbled along the rocky wall following it
then she came upon the light
and she stood frozen with horror her senses refusing to accept the scene
standing in the middle of the tunnel was her sister nancy still clad only in her white nightgown
nancy was holding a coal oil torch in her left hand holding it aloft so its yellowish flame licked at the roof of the vein
and in her right hand nancy gripped a long knife and its bright blade was smeared red with blood nancy nancy came toward her sister slowly holding the torch out before her
in its dancing light eileen could see face plainly
it had a strange expression one of almost childish delight
and her voice when she spoke was like the pleased gurgle of a little girl
ah you are afraid
i can see it now
your face is all knotted and your eyes they stare so
they stare like my fathers eyes stared when he knew he was dying
all life is dull until the moment of death
then comes the thrill the only real thrill in the world
the thrill of meeting death eileen tried to speak but her tongue was numb
she tried to pray but her mind was in the throes of a terrible agony that blotted out all reason
nancy is mad
voices shrieking inside her said
she is not your sister
she is a fiend incarnate
she killed your father with that awful gleaming redsmeared knife
she can kill because she has no soul
she is a fiend and now she is going to kill you
she is going to plunge that knife still smeared with your fathers blood into you
just so she can see your eyes when you die
her knees gave way and she knelt helplessly before the slim young girl who smiled like a child but held a murderous knife upraised pray eileen nancy said softly
it will do no good
i do not like prayers
they are the meanings of weak mortals
maybe when you die you will become a spirit as i am a spirit
you will be happier face took on the reddish glow of the torch and the crimson smear on the bright knife seemed reflected in her eyes
she moved closer
eileen tried to shut her eyes but a strange fascination held them wide and staring
before their terrified stare figure appeared to float toward her like a wraith a murderous specter redstained with human gore
hell underground struggled back to consciousness with the strange feeling that somebody was calling his name far off
his head vibrated with pain and when he touched the back of it with his fingers he felt a large swelling cut across the top
he remembered thinking he had been struck by a cavein but he was not hemmed in by rock or soil
he felt about him in the pitch blackness then called name
there was no answer
his head spun and breathing was difficult
standing erect paul braced himself and took a deep breath
smoke the unmistakable pungent smell of smoke permeated the foul air of the vein tunnel
in the blackness it was even more terrifying
it rolled about him until he thought he could see it in the dark he could taste its oily yellow stench and feel his aching eyes smart with it
eileen was somewhere in that tunnel
she had been lying there in a faint when the blow he believed to be a cavein had felled him
scrambling liolding small paper matches in his fingers he found the fiashliglrt
eileen was gone
tlie crumpled form of paddy gannon was there eyes still wide and staring but the girl was gone
the flashlight showed drifting slow coiling clouds of smoke
somewhere in the iilfated shaft there was a fire
calling the girls name paul hurried toward the far end of the vein tumiel
ahead was a curve and beyond it voices
he rounded the curve and came upon a scene like a picture of an ancient human sacrifice
eileen knelt head bowed on the floor of tlie tunnel
before her holding the torch and die uplifted knife was nancy
the expression on face was sheer rapture
she was staring at face with a gleeful concentration
she did not look up at arrival
he started to shout tlien checked himself
nancy in this mood was dangerous
the knife in her hand was red with blood
put down the knife nancy he said quietly must go
the shaft is on fire
it is burning and we must go
nan took a backward step
fire
beautiful red flames lighting the frightened faces of men inen trapped by fire fire is more beautiful than the knife paul stalled inching close
give me the knife nancy
we will go and watch the fire
the yellow smoke was getting dense in the close tunnel seeping in closing around them like fog
nancy started to hand paul the knife
a voice behind him snarled give it to him point first
plunge it in his throat nancy
watch his eyes as he dies
paul whirled to see john omarra standing in the tunnel right behind a flashlight in his left liand and a club in his right
by the light of torch paul could see the murderous light in dark eyes
paul swung his arm quicldy and threw his own flashlht
john omarra was too close to duck but hie right hand swung the dub just as the flashlight struck him between the eyes
paul dived and lodced both hands around john omarfa s right wrist was trying weakly to get to her feet the smoke was winding and gagging her
the torch nancy held was losing its glare in a pall of creeping smoke
paul hunched his shoulders and held omarra with botli arms while jolin hammered his face and head witfi his free hand head came down and he dosed his jaws on right wrist
he bit down until he felt flesh give felt the bone in his teeth john omarra gave a scream of agony and tried to free his arm
he let go of the club and thrashed around like a wounded tiger
paul could taste warm blood in his mouth
suddenly he unclenched his jaws and smashed with both hands at the face writhing before him in the smoke
as john omarra went down paul drove his heel in his face kicked him savagely ruthlessly until the man went limp on the ground
eileen yes
the girfs answer was a choked sob
the fire is in the shaft
we must go through it to reach the vent we came in by
give me your hand
nancy suddenly came to life at the word fire
she darted past them holding the torch aloft
she disappeared down the tunnel and around the curve
paul tied his handkerchief around nose and mouth and began to lead her back along the tunnel
near the bay where the main shaft went down the smoke was thickest
the fire was dovm below where the men were working but the lift bucket seemed out of order
its cable was silent
only blackness and the oily smoke showed in the beam of light
a down draft at the main shaft forced the smoke out in smothering billows and drove it along the vein
paul held his breath gripped hand and pulled her after him eyes were almost blinded and his lungs were bursting when the opening of the vent showed in his flashlights beam
he pushed eileen up the crude ascent
she was so weak he had to support her weight on his shoulders at each step
the air became clearer
he could breathe
climbing fighting for breath they made the surface toppled out of the little wooden shack and fell forward on the ground side by side
burn the witchl a flash of lightning word hit blairfield
lights went on in houses as the awful news was shouted from one to the other
trouble at the mine
the curse had struck again at the little band of men who had defied it to scratch a little coal from the bowels of the earth
on foot and in tinny old cars the frantic parade wound up the hill to the mine
torches flared and the crowd gathered
they could not go too close for foul black smoke rolled in great billows from the mouth of the shaft
fire
some of the men who had been working on the shift gasped out the story
without warning the first stench of smoke had smitten them
without the usual precautions it was every man for himself with no facilities for fighting the fire or even determining the source
the men on the second level were suffocated before they could claw their way to freedom
some got up in the bucket but the vengeful yellow and black smoke drove back all who tried to reach the others
ten men trapped in that veritable hell while their friends and families wailed and prayed and screamed outside the mouth of the shaft
somebody raised an agonized cry look
nancy gannon and old seamus ocalahan stood on the rise to one side of the shaft
their forms and faces were plainly visible in the dancing torchlight
the old mans face was devoid of expression but the girls was registering sheer ecstasy
the changeling
her standing there bubbling with joy while her own father is in that pit of hell not her own father no child of the world the devils spawn and the cause of our grief a witch
the griefmaddened mob poured its emotion toward this fresh target
the men and women began to call insults and threats
nancy turned toward them and smiled
somebody called
if wed driven her out of town wed have been spared this curse
drive her out now burn her
burn the witch old seamus ocalahan stood between the girl and the onrushing mob his arms outspread
no harm the child done no wrong the old man was trampled underfoot and great red stains showed on his silver beard in the jumping light of the torches as they swept him down to the ground
the girl backed away slowly at first then she turned and began to run throwir over her shoulder a look like a young doe in the forest being harried by a pack of dogs
the part of the crowd that held back at first leaped in their emotions whipped gffil fey the chase
they spread out their torches ttraking crazy jumpiag flaxes ai they raa
they ced bloodctjrdltng threats and goaded themselves by shriel ing words of abuse
the blood lust of the bust was upon them
the pentup fear and anger of days was finding its vent
they closed in behind the rtmning fir snarling like mad dogs and eileen gannon lay about two hundred yards from the mouth of the main shaft
for some minutes their labored and tortured breathing was the only sound either uttered
then paid ssid you all right eileen
yes she answered feeling a little sick and my eyes burn
paul i can understand it all been working on all this trouble at the mine paul told her in gasping breaths
old seamus ocalahan had nothing to do with any more than nancy did
i can explain it all to you if want to listen
yes yes
but not now
wliat are they doing around the mouth of the shaft
why are they all running like that
it must be the fire paul said
there must be men trapped down there nancy was running with mouth open now her eyes staring wildly
the mob snarling at her heels shrieked insane exultation as her gait faltered
her fleet young legs were trembling near exhaustion
ahead was a small clump of woods
she ran toward it
the pursoing mob fatmed and scrambled after her
she was traijod
the litrie knoll ended in an rupt precipice with a sheer drop of more than a hundred feet
she would have to stop at its edge
then they would get trer
the torches moved down more slowly as the pursuers closed in
they advanced oa the little fiogers of laud raised above the surpoanding terrain the trap the huxud doe was too frightened to see
they moved in relentlessly right to the edge of the cliff
a rabbit a small pure white rabbit lookl at them with wide bewildered eyes
but there was no sign of the girl
it was as if she had disappeared from the face of the earth eileen and paul savage searched the faces of the crowd looking for nancy
people paid no attention to them
no explanation of the chase was given
they did not ask
they just kept locdciag half fearfully through the crowd
then somebody told eileen that her father was one of those who had been trapped in the mine probably smothered
at the mention of her fathers name the horrible scene in the mine tunnel rushed back to flood tlie girls senses
she slipped to the ground in a dead faint
when slie opened her eyes paul had carried her back a little way from the crowd around the smoking shaft been woridng on this thing for weeks he told her
it wonot make you feel any better now that your father is gone but the curse that had all these people frantic was a deliberate frameup
johnny omarra had made a deal with a mob who wanted to take take over this mine and bootleg coal
but they knew theyd never take it from the blairfield crowd by force
he framed this stuff those accidents
he used poor strange nancy even started this fire
but the fire got out of band
i donot think he meant it to
i guess hell never come out now was afraid it was really bewitched eileen said
and i vas afraid that nancy and old seamus ocalahan had something to do with it
he had nothing to do with it paul told her and omarra just used nancy
paul do you think she killed dad
eileen whispered
no sure omarra did it
your father must have discovered john was responsible for the dirty work
nancy must have come upon them just as he killed your father
omarra knew nancy was strange so he gave her the knife to frighten us away
but she looked so horrible eileen insisted
she was going to kill me donot think so paul said
she just wanted to see fear in your eyes go home
nancy is probably there by now calm as anyone
nancy was not home when they got there
she was never seen again
the last anyone had seen of her was when she had fled frightened before the mob into that little patch of woods
three days later eileen was getting ready to leave blairfield for good
she was coming out of a store in the village when an old woman stopped her
the same old crone who had called nancy a changeling
the hag bobbed her head and cackled
did you hear about mrs downey eileen shrank back then asked civilly what about mrs downey little white rabbit came out of the woods and hopped right into her kitchen it must have been good luck because mrs downey childless these sixteen years just had a baby girl
and she not knowing or expecting one
i was there when it was bom
a pretty little girl with big blue eyes that slant up at the outside corners very nice sure
eileen hurried on to where paul was waiting in his car the matter
paul asked
you look as if youd just seen a ghost afraid if i stay here i will she said
paul drive as fast as you can and as far as you can
there are some things never be able to understand and i donot think i want to and never never talk to me about anything that happened here just as long as i live
still brooding about nancy
she gave him a long searching look
no stopped brooding about nancy hard to explain but nancy is off my conscience now
i donot feel that pm responsible for her any more
paul breathed a sigh of relief
thank goodness thats cleared up
eileen shook her head
no
it isnot and it never will be
but there are some things i donot want to understand and thats one of them
paul nodded
amen
bij appel author of attic of terror etc sequestered in their swampland home ralph payne and his beautiful young wife desired strong comely children
but that was before their splendid bodies began to turn into horrid travesties of human form which could never produce such offspring ometimes at night when a high moon glints on the surface of that dark pool where first i encountered the shrinking death doubt and terror cleave my brain with their daggerstrokes and i despair of ever regaining my normal physique and health
sometimes in my sleep i seem to feel again the hideous torpidity of mind the loathsome human fluidity of bone and muscle that rendered me an inert jellyfish shrunken to the proportions of a child
but science yet may save me
we were celebrating my thirtieth birthday here at the old louisiana plantation where our family the paynes have lived for a century past
on every hand the grounds are guarded by a barrier of forbidding swamps through which a hard road leads to various plots of high land now cultivated by adsite tenants oece tilled by my grandfatliws bkek slaves
during the year since grace and i were married the old manor house had been modernzed in varions ways and foremost among improvements was a gleaming whitetiled outdoor swimming pool designed to take the curse off torrid summer days
when the scorching sus had drojqjed behind a surrounding wail of nmssdraped ejpress trees grace proposed a coding dip
akhoi our guest
doctor hemerich koop made some small objection socm we coaxed him into a bathing suit and led him to the brink of the inviting basin
grace ran to the end of the springboard her delitely molded form poised as lightly as a mocking birds upon a swaying bough
arcing through the air a clean dive that setrt drops sparkling upward she rose to the surface laughing and called come in i delightful then her face sobered as she floated there regarding the two of us with thoughtfrri eyes the comparison she was msdfing vid knew the reason
doctor koc whom i bad endoyed ostetsibly to manage a small hospital tqon tfte jrfantation for the benefit of tenant families but actually to safeguard the health of my bride was one of her schoolday lovers whose doglike devotion had endured through adolescent years
as one of an adoring dozen she had given liis aspirations no serious thought until with college behind iiim and a profitable profession ahead he proposed marriage and she told him it could not be
with disarming candor she had confessed that wanted a husband whose physique would match her own bodily health and streitii because she desired numerous and there must be no heredity taints that might prevent tise growth of tall sons and love daughters years numbered the same as mine but i stood six feet two in my stoddngs and tipped the scales at two hundred weight
he was a scrawny man of five feet four and a childhood injury had left his back huitthed
beneath his bulging brow dwelt a brain whose keenness mine probably never would attain although i did enough at managing tlie estate
hemerich koop also guessed the tenor of lier thoughts
srailir he said heartily what a gorgeems pair of animals you are
in with you ralph and have your fun sit and watch
with die sense of something akki to pity plunged sympathizing with the hopelessness of his pliit yet selfishly glad in the knowledge that liis foodoeas for would result in especially watchful care
that meant a great deal to a young couple expecting to raise a family in tlie depths of a swamp forty miles from tlie nearest dty
it more than that to me five minutes latw when a monstrous face was thrust out of a dump of shrubbery a few yards away and the idiot pedro begaa smarling obscene spanish oaths which frightened grace into a fit of trembling hysteria
following a final gst of vile curses pedro hurled some curiously shaped object which splashed into the pool near where grace dung to me
then he scuttled into the swamp before i could call a servant to catch him
i held my wife in my arms sitting upon a bench beneath the pergola while koop ran to the house for his small black bag
returning he gave her a sedative
between us we strove to calm her fears insisting that the outburst was meaningless but still terrified she cried he has grown more boldl it has a dreadful meaning
that old crone zell mendez is slowly goading him to the point of murder
they mean to kill you ralph because of the accident that crippled him
i laughed the idea aside but even hemerich darkbrowed face betrayed deep concern
uneasily he said all the tenants talk of the threats zell mendez makes against you
they fear her curses
superstitiously they believe that she is in league with the devil
sometimes i wonder
sorcerers have performed strange deeds which science cannot fathom
for sake koop
i exclaimed
you donot mean that you believe in such twaddle he smiled grimly
not as witchcraft
if thats what youre thinking
but we live in a swamp ralph and i must confess that some of the secrets of swamp herbs and poisons handed down from one generation of voodoo practitioners to another have not yet been solved by the medical profession
did you read last spring of the man in bay st louis whose stature is slowly shrinking
who has been dwarfed to the size of a child from a height of six feet not only is he said to be suffering from a curse but similar cases have been recorded in barbados and in porto rico
it makes one wonder angrily i seized the bottle of brandy he had brought from the house and gulped a steadying drink
grace said tearfully why should she blame you that old old witch for an accident that was unavoidable three people swore that pedro mendez darted out of the brush squarely in front of your car forget it dear i said inwardly shuddering at the recollection of a stunning impact the sickening crunch of flesh under heavy wheels the screams of the stricken idiot when my speeding roadster felled him
doctor koop did everything pyossible for the poor fellow
and neither curses nor his mothers will mend his crooked legs nor harm us
hemerich koop was looking toward the glassy surface of the pool
what did he throw at you when he was swearing there saw something queer splash see
standing on the brink i scrutinized the white bottom saw a small blue bottle lying in the deep end exuding an inky cloud
there it is fetch it up
i dived
the immersion cooled my excited blood instantly
but even as i enjoyed the pleasant sensation blighting fir struck home
cooled met i felt chilled to the bone
my limbs seemed frozen
neither arms nor legs would function
in a state of complete paralysis i glided to the bottom
the air in my lungs slowly raised me to the top but i hung face downward helpless
by no force of will could i command the movement of a single muscle
when my tortured lungs rebelled and i could no longer forestall the gasp which filled them with water in a drowning flood i heard shrill cry of alarm echo as from a great distance
then a uack coma enfolded me time which foibwed was marked hy vagufr peria of light and darkness
i realised that i lay in a hospital bed tiiat a and a nurse came and wet that i had sot drowned but was alive and nights passed like a blur cd delirium studded with moments of excruciating agony broken by terrifying ta which tiie idiots face tft leer at me as i suffered there while he gibbered of escape from pain through u3e of some drug contained in a small beetle ef hellish midnht blue
at last after an eternity o nameless terror there came a ef clear consciousness yet so weak had my strange illness left me that i could not raise my heavy eyelids and perforce without a sign of life lay listening to the voices of doctor koop and grace
he is wasting away to death
my vrifes anguished tone was sharp with grief
it is zell curse i is doomed
you cannot save him now now my dear the doctor chided give up hope so easily
he lives
and while theres life theres hope aplenty
if only i could tell his voke thinned on a troubled note
whedier this queer shrinkage is die restdt of a drug or something worse said that before there was near frenzy in cry you too believe it is a curse that zell mendez has bewitched him nonsense
koop snapped sharply
of course it must be the work of a drug
but unfortunately the small blue bottle which pedro tlffew into the swimmmg pool had quite emptied itself brfoie i went back to recorer it of water the tank produced no satisfactnry tceidts because of great
tilution
we have not yet divered the nature of the poison
if zell mendez codd be forced to despair edged my wifes sweet voice plded with her but riie only laughs showing her yellow hags teetli in a gloating snarl calling down still more terrible oirses upon poor head
oh will he ever be conscious again
or trill he die try as i might i could not opm my ey nor give any sign that life was buramore brightly within me that all was not lost grace came to the bedside felt the warm towh of her fingers opon my cold and fiiuxtd hand in iter stifled sob acre was a note of sheer horror tlie reason for which i did not then comprehend
somehow you rau stop this horrible thing heuierich she exclaimed
at any cost
call in specialists to aid you use every resource that money can buy before it is too late
my dear grace hemerich koop said money wonot help nor can any specialist am doing my best to infitiicfr the outcome of this peculiar sekure and no one could do more
his words cheered me as i lay there a motionless helpless hulk for i knew the keenness of his brain his thoroughness in seeking the solution of difficulties
if only he could contrive to ease the worries widi which grace was besieged
they left the room together
i heard door open and close
then for hours it seemed i was plagued ly visions of vicious faces leering
the tmwholesotne countenance of old zell meadez loomed above the foot of my bed sixgetoothed wildeyed stringy grey hair straggling across her leathv cheeka
i the bps mouthed venomous curses over and over and never in life or death would she the accident that had cripfded her son magltgnant visage tormeftted me after his mothers dnsmed and faded
a moron at best he was and pimply
his forehead sloped straight away in line with a long pointed nose and his chin receded obliquely to form a snouted face like a hogs
after my car had smashed his legs and left them but flopping clubs upon which he stumped about with the aid of two canes appearance was enough to frighten women and children
his witless tongue forever drolled profane obscenity
lying there in my torpid state seeming to hear the foul threats he voiced suddenly i was obsessed with fear for grace
what if the idiot sought to vent his spleen upon her
alone in our big house save for black servants she would prove easy prey for him
the thought shocked me into wakefulness
my eyes snapped open they widened with consternation and my jaw hung loose at sight of the ugly face peering through an open window near my bed
i gasped
is it you
did i hear you talking meant every word of it he whispered shrilly
and why not
now youre no better than me
filthy beast i rasped weakly
if i hear that youve so much as looked at grace horsewhip you
and should you attempt to molest her break your back with my two hands
your hands
look at em and tell me how much breakin they can ever do never get off that bed alive you know that your finish is all planned
pedro loosened the screen and swung it aside
i thought he intended to clamber in and murder me but a streak of stubbornness kept me from calling aloud for help
with all the force of my will i strove to lift the hands he mentioned so contemptuously but could not as a babe i demanded hoarsely what do you want
what do you mean to do pedro grinned his eyes shining redly like two mirrors of hate
his subdued laughter jangled do everything i said after youre dead
she wonot listen till youre gone
but now that you look worse than me your pretty wifell let me love her once youre out of the way
a red haze of hate suffused my brain and for a space i could not see clearly
then the spasm passed and i found him leaning through the aperture balancing a tiny blue bottle upon his palm
take it
pedro invited
quick death easy death without any pain
ma wanted me to slip it into your grub to make sure you die
but worth the risk dyin now
take it yourself so your wifell quit cryin about you and listen to me
get out
i raged
go away from that window before i yell for help have you shot pedro drew back hurriedly
that ainot no way to act he complained after i came to do you a favor
here leave the bottle in this comer see it and youll want it soon
he re fastened the screen
after a long gloating look at me pedro disappeared
a lowflung shaft of light from the setting sun glinted upon the blue bottle and i stared fascinated wondering if in truth i might soon want the poison
why had the idiot said now that you look worse than me
i remembered doctor comment concerning a strange shrinkage that puzzled him
did he mean my skin the wasting of my flesh i shuddered at thought of freakish human skeletons i had seen struggled in a blinding effort to gain control of my limbs almost succeeded
after had fallen back gasping upon the psilow a harrowing iir possessed me
something was horribly wroi
i must get up and away to grace
what the ensuing effort to rise rost me in mental strain and mortal agony cmly god can realize
if there be such a thing as actual power of mind over matter then it was that which in the end gave me emnmand of my musdes again
striving to the point of deadly nausea beset in every joint by dreadful pains which nearly drove me mad at last myself to a sittit position swung my legs down frmn the bed
clinging to the white iron framework i made an effort to stand although at first my knees buckled miserably
dimly i perceived the door of a closet across the room
on hands and knees i crawled to it seeking a robe or other covering for my nakedness
i reached for the knob three times and failed before i could draw myself erect
swa dng there i found inside a suit of my dothes which grace must have brought as a childish means of bolstering hope that cme day i would wear them home
draggmg garments from the hooks i crawled back to tte bed again
after a grueling ordeal of rising and seating myself i drew on the dark grey trousers and to stand
dazedly i stared down at their absurd length noting that the legs were at least foot toe longi fumbling in the pockets found a familiar purse
yes indulntabty they were mine
turning a little then i caught a glimpse of my reflectioi in the glass of a window that was closed
a cry of horror burst across my lips at sight of the revolting figure there darkly revealed
a dvrarfted and hairless monstrosity
my bald skull bulked far too large for the scrawny neck and stunted frame which supported it
deepset eyes were gloomy cavems beneath my brow
my nearly fleshless jaws were those of a head lips per thin and dghtly drawn
my broad shoulders had narrowed and were bunched like those of a deformed child
my long and powerful legs were shrunken to sindling bony shanks from which the last vestige of strength was swiftly ebbing
staring at the odious reflected sliape i felt my reason sway
locsii a rendering screen i toppled upon tlie floor and sank into a bottomless abyss of blackness in which my sufferings were extinguished with the appalling slowness of creeping death
i lived
when next i knew deaths groping clutch had missed me it was to find myself again reposing in the hospital bed
tbe voices i heard and the xjken words dispelled an awful lethargy which gripped my brain but did not break the drains of weakness that shackled my leaden limbs
ah god i canot bear to look at him
it was my wifes despairing cry
no curse has done this
it fs the poison
i listened to her muffled sobs of horror
doctor hemerich koop was spealdug but i could not distinguish the things he said
when my eyes flicked open i saw that he held grace in his arms and was whispering with lips pressed close against her golden hair
she broke away and whirled to face him her cheela flushed with anger and dismay
you dare say such things to me
while ralph res dying as well say dead my dear for soon he shall be
and even though i were to keep him alive would you not choose me small and ugly though i am in preference to the jellylike thing which was once a man ah he is watching us see him quivering there like a viscous blob upon the sheet
you demon grace screamed in chattering frenzy
not zell mendez but you you did this and why not
he stole your love from me
as though i ever could have loved a hunched and evil creature am a man koop thumped his narrow chest proudly am active and strong
my brain is fine
look now at the one who thought himself superior
is not ralph payne a disgusting sight
he little resembles that father of tall sons and lovely daughters of whom you boasted
grace approached on laggard feet and stood beside my bed
tears streaming she touched my torpid arm my bony face crying bitterly love him his soul lives despite the ruin youve made of his magnificent body
oh what have you done to him
what blight have you wrought
doctor koop came near and hatred glowed in his eyes as he grinned down at me
it was a master stroke he bragged
the strategy of using zell mendez and her halfwit spawn as pawns in my little game
for days on end she voiced her threats to all she met after the accident
there are fifty witnesses to swear that she contemplated the murder of ralph payne and made pedro help her plan it
now both are jailed accused of poisoning your husband by contaminating the swimming pool and no one ever shall hear of the clever operation that i performed upon his throat
grace stared and so did my powers of speech paralyzed as yet although my tongue curled and twisted in an effort to talk
you operated on ralph why my wifes eyes were round with terror
oh tell me what youve done to him
is there no cure could cure him but at a price you may not wish to pay
another might if be were skilled in the science of the glands and knew what i have done
prevailing upon pedro mendez to hide nearby and toss a bottle of common poison into the pool after frightening you i let ralph drink of drugged liquor from a bottle i brought knowing that wed have to rescue him from his dive
the numbing effect of the drug i used is instantaneous
that gave me an excuse to bring him here to the hospital
with only a simpleminded cajun girl to help i planted a globule of metallic compound at the base of the parathyroid gland where it would immediately create sufficient pressure to halt the glands functioning
the result as you see was swift decalcification of his bones a shrinking of stature a wasting of flesh
he is like a thing of rubber and jelly now as death approaches
but he could be cured
grace pleaded
oh say that he can be saved of course
by removal of the pressure and with proper treatment in a matter of months he might regain his normal size and health
but who shall grant him that boon my dear
you shall
hemerich
you say you love me
you must be kind
restore him forgive and forget
stop this madness and use your skill to make him a man again
you heard my terms
i mentioned a price smile was lecherous
he seized grace in his arms and sought her lips
the price is yourself mine for always
and you must answer now shall i forget the play of torturing emotions that swept over my dear wifes face as she fought to submerge her revulsion to find the courage to endure an odious ordeal
she gasped what do you mean for always not after he is well
if i grant him life koop said harshly it must be without you and he shall never know
at best his mind might not be restored cwnpletely
it do rso harm to make certain of that
coerprehoiding his horrible intention to render me a witless hulk endowed witii life grace tfcrew herself upon her knees and
beaded piteously
roughly koop thrust her hands aside
if i only wanted you now take you
it most be of your own free will and always
again weakening he bis skhmy arms about her and pressed his raisive lips to hers
grace tore hetsdf free she strode him wkh her open palm and dropped in a sdng hc upon die bed beside me
let me die wkh ralph e moaned touch nse
only let me hemerich swarthy face paled greyly
i knew then that he had expected victory
failure seeraed to drive him mad
die
never you fool keep the pair of you alive so long as the spark can be held within your rotting bodies
you shall endure the same operation grace mid in tum sh become as he is
bones of rubber and flesh of jdly while your brain melts in harrowing helplessness
if you love him so you shall lie beside him and dream of the ecstasies that you win know no more
springing upon grace koop bound her hands ivith a towel likewise her ankles
dashing out of the room he returned with a hypodermic fringe and plunged the needle into her arm
soon my wifes froiaied strules ceased
removing lier bonds koop leaned across motionless body and peered into my startmg eyes
you know
i can read the suffering there both mast live to suffer endlessly
white i watdi over you day by day and laugh at two steong lovers eoited tall sons and lovely daughters his har mirth echoed in the room
he opened the door and called
addie cenne here a dulleyed cajun girl appeared fear written large upon her stupid features
koop exclaimed the lady is sick
you must help me operate he carried grace out
the girl cast a frightened look at me
i thought her lips moved in settndtess pky that she felt an urge to render aid btrt stark terror held her captive and she koop obediently
once more i set my mind to the task of making the fie
y
if only i cotald move roll off the bed crawl to the room where grace lay helpless beneatli his this time i coedd not
my greatest effort served only to elevate ragr head a triffing way
but in that brief instant a downward glance encompassed my shrunken legs and i groaned in trembling horror
the two limbs lay coiled awry ion the sheet like rubber tubes in which no of bone remaiaed
koop had spoken truly
i was but a jdlylike blob of slowly liquefying matter that was scarcely flesh
the shock seemed to disintegrate iy brain and consciousness faded was lying upon a bed which had been moved into the room before i awalsened
some one had turned me upon my side so that i might sec her there when the toqior lifted
a white bandage encircled her throat and lier eyes were wide and starii
both wrists and ankles were caught dose to the irem frasnework by broad straps to her prisoner
her quiverkig lips formed a whispered query ralph
can you hear me
can you speak
for long moments i fou the rigidity of throat mitsdes then croaking worda grated across my dry tth
yes i heu
oh god
i see he operated on me soon i shall as ymi orsl the dread sentice of doom gushed out of her very soul a gulp of anguish
how long gasped week he sa before the gland is aeriou affected
oh there is ao hope voice sounded at the doorway
his hateful vise was framed there grinning
oh yes there is my dear
i might yet reconsider within the week you decide that life with me is preferable to living putrescence i found the strength to curse him to utter threatening prophecies of retribution
doctor koop only smiled
you have revived considerably as a result of treatment last mght while you were unconscious i want you stronger that you may suffer morel while you lie there waiting watching
he stepped away to bed threw back the coverlid tore her gown away
lust gleamed in his hot eyes but hunger for vengeance and the will to torture prevailed
he turned aside muttering seeing her lovely form shrivel and shrink be wrinkles and bony angles where you knew curves and tender maidens flesh
love will be smothered in revulsion as you watch each other disintegrate and become two dwarfed disgusting thills with only brain cells hvir
kocp went out saying as he departed soon the treatment will make you ravenously hungry payne
in an hour or so bring you food and feed you with my own hands
for you must kve
to see and suffer
his brittle ladbter edioed from a distance
grace was weeping
i could think
rf no cheering thing to say
stupefied i lay resigned to the inevitable
but soon i experienced a faiat soisation oi hfe of tkodatiei in the atm which ky cnisfaed beneath my body remark flashed across my mind
you will be stroir
the treatment last night hepe flared faintly
strong enough to move to crawl to exhaust the last famt spark of life force seeking aid for grace
i thoiht of our isolated positiem in ffie swamp then remembered the telephone
but the instrument in the outer oflice might as well have been miles away
feverishly my frantic brain struged with the problem of what mitt be done if found some vntige strength restored
my wandering gare paused at ffie nearest window
an ktea sprat into being
grace i exclatml
there may be a fighting diance
if you could free an arm or leg
try it
pitifully she looked at me and shook her head but i urged frantically try
twist and try grace began to writhe to ti and struggle
faint moans of pain escaped her lips as the straps cut skin and flesh
at last said one foot loose
but i canot do any niwe
plant your heel against the wall i cried
push hard
force your bed against mine and shove me nearer to the window ojily a matter of inches grace succeeded in doing wliat i asked
our beds collided and the impulse of her thrust skidded my cot against tlie window sill rolling me upon my back as i made a desperate effort in that direction
lying there then i tried to move my hands found new life tlie finger tips but none in my arms
slowly gropiily nails scratching at the bed linen and mind savely intent upon aeoimplishment i draped one hand in fractional jerks across the sheet onto the window ledge and seized ffie tiny bottle that pedro mendes had hidden there
the trivial mtucukr feat that fcowed exhausted me more than i can express
with the prize precariously clutched between thumb and forefinger i worked my hand back by the power of fingertips alone until it reached my body
three attempts i made to raise that left arm and failed
then like a crawling worm i made it creep across my chest until it met the other
in a little while when the cold sweat of weakness beaded my brow and nearly all my strength was spent with my right hand i laid the vial in palm
her fingers closed upon it
what it means escape i exdaimed
hide donot understand
her eyes sought nune
i rolled my head and whispered it is poison came later bearing a well laden tray
his forecast was correct i knew the pangs of hunger but the viands he carried interested me less than the bottle of wine
placing the food upon a table he turned to smile at grace and said hurt yourself struggling
one strap was poorly fastened
why not agree to my proposals and have them all off
my wife looked up at him long and moodily
one could scarcely recognize her voice when chokingly she said canot bear itl to be hke him
oh godl i canot you mean doctor koop leaned above her eagerly
that you have counted the cost of hopeless love for the thing that he has become my love is dead she stormed hjterically was faithful i was true
but ralph payne is gone
there remains only that
she swung her eyes toward me and quickly looked away
koop exclaimed then come to me
oh this is glorious
awkwardly in his haste he fumbled at the straps which bound her
casting them aside he caught grace in his arms and helped her to arise
my dear one
my lovely one he gloated
always watched you wanted you
and now you are mine with a shuddering sigh grace pushed his pawing hands aside forced a shrill laugh crying yours i shall be but donot ever call it love the price i must pay
have it your own way he snapped
so long as you do pay be angry grace pleaded am upset and unnerved
perhaps a littie of that wine he snatclied up the bottle smiling again
of course just the thing pouring two glasses he raised one and turned to me in mock salute
now ralph payne youll have sanething more to watch to greater suffering
grace lowered the glass from her lips face white as death exclaiming drink your toast to me
have i not deserved it countenance split an evil grin improving my dear wcu get along famously
grace took his glass half emptied and gave him hers
the better to seal our bargain hemerichl she cried and a laugh like an echo from hell rattled upon her bloodless lips
koop tossed off the drink at a gulp
he started violently
a terrible tremor shook his scrawny frame from head to foot
collapsing he screamed poison man expired before he struck the floor
grace crashed her glass inst the wait aad swaged as though she might the door opened
addie the cajun girl stood gaping there through d keyhole ae whispewd
is he dead dead i shoitted rdief strengthenhig the voice in my throat executed just as we ffenned it he was a devi
he put a curse on jou she mtunbled stupidly
the tdihone i gaed as vague fears

private residence hotel or whatever it might be it perched like an eagles nest high on the crags with the rivergorge in a hairpin turn almost surrounding it
eerie location indeed with these wild lightless defiles slashed and broken stormswept by rain and wind of gale force now
the trail looped and turned and then we came to the small rocky top with the twostory rambling stone structure before us
the lights of its windows were blurred yellow blobs through the torrential rain
whatever sort of place it was it had to be our resting place for the night
our car would jack baker felt that all was not well in the ominous appearing establishment of the sinister dr groff but he little guessed when he took his beautiful young sister into that place that he was exposing her to the brutal lusts of one whom a weird madness had already driven to acts of unnameable horror a novell atto o nightcloaked mystery and death go no further
i pulled up under a portecochere
our radiator was boiling again the engine was knocking violently when i shut it oif
iiad enough i said as i climbed from the car
wherever we are here we stay
if i had known good evening sir
the voice by its very unexpectedness was horribly startling
edith my sister gasped with a faint suppressed cry
i whirled to find a man standing at my elbow
in the dimness here under the portecochere roof i could see him as a tall figure broad and burly
he was without hat and outer coat evidently seeing our approaching headlights as we toiled up the grade he had come out to greet us
oh i said
how do you do
my sister and i were lost
you we hoped this was a hotel our cars running badly were hungry
he turned with a queer stooping gesture as though peering at edith
he said dr emil groff
a heavy guttural foreign voice but there was a dignified suavity about it hotel he said
well not just that
but you are welcome
come in
the young lady must be cold
he left us standing on the threshold of the open door while against my protestations he carried in our two suitcases
we saw a dim hallway with electric lamps heavily shaded
a tall brownhaired young woman in a maids uniform stood watching us
and suddenly there was the distant sound of a girls laughter instantly checked
it echoed through the silent interior and there was about it so eerie a quality that edith and i stared at each other wordlessly and the maid whirlii at the soimd hurried instandy away
dr emil groff came with our suitcases
most horrible night my friends shall put your car away later shorthanded tonight
my nurse is on holiday and my man went to chattanooga for supplies
i fear the storm may keq him away for tonight
what was this place
a hospital
a madhouse
i saw this dr groff now as a man of perhaps forty
a burly sixfoot fellow with a head of closeclipped black hair a smoothshaven face of rugged somewhat handsome features
he stood fingering a black eyeglass ribbon that hung around his neck his dark gaze from deepset eyes under heavy black brows seemed appraising me
oh yes i said awkwardly
it certainly is a bad night
i told him our name baker and that we were traveling from florida to chicago
he listened with a very queer grave smile faintly pulling at his mouth and abruptly he interrupted me
well i am honored that you came here mr baker
we shall make you comfortable this storm no one could travel these mountains a night like this
his gaze clung to dark slim beauty
he added we are glad to have you my dear young lady
we will do everything possible to make you happy
a madhouse here in this wild lonely mountain fastness
this man himself one of the inmates
thoughts may run wild very fast edith took an involuntary step backward as though his words were physically repelling and she flung me a startled questioning glance
then before i could speak he had turned to me understand you mr baker
his lowered voice and his bulk momentarily exduded edith who was a few feet from us
your sister needs attention
later we will discuss the details that my wits were scattered ttw the brownhaired maid in her biack and white umform again sending near ua
i mmered wi we donot want to intrude dr groff
i reafly thought this was a hotel my one wild wish then was to get edith out of here storm or no storm
hotd he said
well yes you might call it that
of course your stay will be brief supper only perhaps if the storm dimimshes
when my man returns i will ha him fix your car
he is a very good mechanic the maid said shall i take tliem upstairs dr groff
yes millie
just temporary rooms
they may leave after supper bring up their hjge the maid touched arm
come miss
she said it gently but firmly as one would talk to a child
and again groff was leaning close to me
naturally they donot like the idea of permaaeney almost always the case
edith the patient to be humored upon her admittance here
i smiled with relief
look he i said got us all wrong dr groff
is this a hoital
i didnot realize it
i assure you theres nothing wrong with my sister
certainly this fellow was no madman
he saw that edith could not hear me now that i could not possibly be talking for her benefit he looked startled and disappointed
he said did not understand you
it is so almost impossible for any one to arrive here by chance
but we did i said and smiled
a sudden vue hostility had come to him
his gaze had an appraising suspicion in it i addfed wonot intrude further
his seemed to vanish
no inbsstcm ite said
this is groff hatf
we receive patients who are depressed
melancholic shall i say
my treatment has proven very efficacious
there is happiness here certainly nothing very sinister for all its weird morbidness
i said s well then if we might have lodging until the storm is past
of course he agreed
my charges are reasonable and we have plenty of room oh my wife
dr agatha groff
this is mr baker and bis sister
not patients they were lost in the storm
a woman in bladt load approached us
despite my polite endeavor to smile as i took her extended hand an inward shudder swept me
the woman was of indeterminate age certainly older than her stalwart husband little hunched thickset figure no taller than my shoulder gorillalike with long thick arms
he dress was stiff black taffeta wkh white ruching around her short neck where her head set down between wide hunched shoulders
the dress gave an incongruous air of primness carried also by her black hair streaked with grey primly parted in tlie middle plastered down and rolled into a knot at the back
but it was her face that most startled me
sharp hatchet feattires and for all her smile new there was so intent a malevolence in her face that i caught my breath
mr baker
you are welccane she bad the same guttural accent as her husband
her hand gripping mine was like a roughened scaly daw
then she turned to where edith stood you are welcome my dear
her little glittering eyes seemed feasting on dark slhn beauty die sucked in her breath with an audfele hiss
wl my dear child you are beautiful 4eautiful we presently followed the maid upstairs
edith grilled my arm go right after supper
yes of the storm was far more apparent up here on the second floor
the slap and pound of the rain on the roof was audible
gusts of wind as though this were a tropical hurricane rattled the old building from end to end
a dim upper hallway confronted us with ft number of bedrooms opening from it the maid turned to a dosed door almost at the head of the staircase
she said this will suit you mr baker
two connecting rooms
tliere is plenty of choice
we have only two other patients just now
she had a quiet dignity this maid
an intelligentlooking handsome girl of about twenty
wliat could have been her dark ftnd tragic history tliat made her a part of this wild place
i have often wondered
other patients
i said not patients leaving right after supper
as though the storm were hurlipg defiance at my words there came a sudden sizzling lightning flash and a crack of thunder with it
the lurid glare showed through a window at the distant end of tfie hall
the electric lights of the house simultaneously vanished so that for that bisant i saw the figures of edith and the maid painted greenwhite and the decrepit hallway an inferno of glare
then the hall lights flickered on again
the thunder rolled away into the distance like ft grumbling retreating giant
edith gasped good heavens that was dose
we have bad storms in these mountains sometimes the maid said
she stood with her hand on the bedroom door her gaze on edith going after supper not sick
no edith said and tried to smile not from one of these upper bedrooms near us now again came that eerie chilling burst of laughter
so close to us it seemed two girls laughing behind one of these closed doors
laughter so queer so wildly unnaturally strange that to the listener there could not seem any quality of mirth in it but only horror
i saw the maid stiffen she took an involuntary step toward the sound
then she changed her mind and swung on us going right after supper
she was breathless with furtive lowered voice
on the nearby stairs dr groff was starting up with our suitcases
you do tliat the maid added swifdy
you never mind tlie storm you get your sister out of here yes i agreed
i gripped her shoulder as i bent toward her
millie tell me a bedroom door diagonally across the hall burst open
from it two young girls came running
the hall light shone on their slim pinkwhite beauty their bodies clad in brief filmy undergarments their hair wildly flowing
they staggered together into the hall clinging to each other wildly laughing in a paroxysm of macabre mirth
then they saw millie as she sprang for them
we want mrs groff they screamed
where is mrs groff it time
millie was struggling with them
no not time yet
you go back
you shouldnot have done that you stop it
she shoved them back into the roan and banged the door on them
but their wild screaming laughter still sounded
edith and i stood frozen
gruesome unholy laughter
what was this gliastly thing lurking rend than five minutes had passed
dr emil groff had brought mp our suitcases with his face stolidly inscrutable ignoring that brief wild appearance of the two laughing girls
in the hall he had murmured a few words to millie with a glance at the nearby door behind which the girls now were silent
i caught a fragment of the maids answer locked them in
then dr groff had come to our door
supper will be ready presently
come down soon
he left us he and the maid descended the stairs
edith stood shuddering
i took a look around the two small bedrooms
they were meagerly but comfortably furnished
each had a single window and a door to the hall and there was a connecting door between them
i peered from one of the windows
solid blackness with only the wild rage of the storm
but i could see enough to realize that there was a sheer drop from these windows down into the canyon upon the brink of which the house was perched
those girls edith murmured when i went back to her
whatever this macabre mystery i could see no sense of talking about it
heaven knows edith was frightened enough get us out of here right after supper i said
then we heard a car arriving
not the manservant from chattanooga for as we silently moved out to the head of the stairs the visitors were visible down in the lower hall
dr groff and millie greeting a party of three
two men and a girl
one of the men was elderly greyhaired
he seemed ill he stood a moment thi millie brought a chair in which he sat down while the other man talked with dr groff
this other man was young in his thirties doubtless a stalwart fellow with smooth black hair
the girl had taken off her hooded cloak
the hall light gleamed on her palegold tresses
she was small no older than edith and extremely beautiful
i thought suddenly of the way dr deformed hag of a wife had stared at the dark slim beauty of edith
was this new arrival another possible victim
an aura of wealth was upon these three latest visitors
they came upstairs in a moment
at the staircase head they turned down the hall in the other direction so that they did not pass our door but the girls voice floated to us not too tired father
we were presently ready to go dowm to supper
as we started it seemed that amid all the noises of the outside storm i heard footsteps pattering away in the upper hall
edith wait here a minute the dim lull was empty but ten feet or so beyond the locked door where millie had shoved the two girls the hall turned a right angle to the left into anotlier wing of the building
i ran there
the hall beyond the angle was almost dark
thirty feet from me it seemed that i saw a shadow blob of dark indistinguishable shape disappearing into a doorway
i section of the hall was heavily carpetal
i padded noiselessly forward into the deepening darkness
it wasnot a doorway into which the sliadow had plunged but the top of a steep flight of descending back stairs
solid blackness
but down at the bottom there was a vertical slit of light which marked a door
the slit was narrowing the door evidently just being closed by whoever it was i had been following
the door stopped ajar and abruptly i heard dim voices
they were muffled blurred by the confined space and the sounds of the storm but i caught fragments of the words
you ludvig what are you doing
no busmess of yours
who was it who oanje
the forrests
the old man and rolf forrest his nephew
and the old mans dauiter came it was emil groff talking i felt sure of tliat
then ludvig said his daughter i i saw hut somehow glowinglike burnished ludvig
stop that you fool
youb get us into troubte with your devitisb you talk eke fftat to mel emil you dare talk like that
yes i do lia going to stojp i tell you
these two damnable girisfwhen they die thats the end have no in this get ns into trouble there was a wild cadthog fellah
this ludvig whose authority emil now was challenging was this a nr something near it get us mto trouble
worse than your muiders emil
worse than wg money fn that you focd
these fosre are rich be carefully pknoed so there is no daiir to us in it this young fellow rolf forrest you go to hell ludwig suddenly rasped
you canot control me youll do what i you as you always have
who owns tins building
whose mcm set yon in business here
again that wild chucklmg laughter
you dare to tell me what i shall dol plsure emil
what is life without pleasure
it seemed suddenly that they were scuffling
the door at the foot of these back stairs clicked closed as one cd dietn against it and the sounds were shut from me
with my heart pottnding i went back to edith
a maniac loose here
thus ludvig lurking here never showing himself intent only on hts lust for scmie weird fentastlc pleasure
edith was still at our bedroom door
jack what was it
nothing i said
swne one may have been up here went down the back stairs i didnot see anybody in a minute or two vrt left tlic room
muffled eerie laughter was coming again from the bedroom in whidi the two girls were locked
in spite of ourselves we stood a moment shudderingly listening to it then we desceitded the front staircase
in the front lower hall mrs groff came forward to meet us
ah my dear children you are ready come in to supper
she stood in her prim black taffda smiling at tis ingratiatingly
hideous little woman
a travesty of wonianhood like a grinning fanale gargoyle
i wondered then if my reyolted impressioiw of her were not inspired by the mere misfortune of her deformed physical ugliness
certainly she seemed trying to be pleasant
she fed us akmg the back lower hall to the dining room where a dozen broad tables stood devoid qf setting
you have very few patients just now i said yes only two millie serves them in their room
and a party of three who will dine with you
the table here in a corner of the dining room was set for six
the forrests came now and when the introductions were over mrs groff said my husband he expected to be your host but he is detained my thoughts leaped
he was stiff having troubte with ludvig
why was there no mention of this ludvig
mrs groff added but dr groff will join you presently
as for me i must hdp she smiled her grimace upon us all
she this terrible storm we will do our best for you she moved off to the kitchen and millie served ns
five of us with one empty chair like a spectre in our midst
we were in truth a strange little gathering
old mr forrest a man with the aura of wealth and the blight of illness so obviously upon him
rolf forrest his nephew stalwart darkly handsome fellow with an arrogant swagger that wealth had doubtless given him
and anne forrest
to her most of my interest went
she was sitting beside me hair of pale gold faultless complexion a face beautiful as a cameo
beautiful as edith
amazing contrast these two girls the dark slim latin beauty of edith inherited from our mother and this anne like a little fragile flower of the north not detail our conversation during the meal
it was strained awkward as though each of us might be engrossed with thoughts that could not be voiced
edith and i told the misadventures which had landed us there
and the others explained that old mr forrest had come here for his health a nervous depression which had come upon him from overwork in nashville shall be lonely here he said somberly
but only for a week or two uncle rolf forrest said
then youll be so well well come and get you and take you back
anne forrest spoke hardly a word
but when the meal was nearly over at a moment when the others were talking with edith she suddenly leaned toward me
and i caught her agitated murmur must see you alone tonight please yes i murmured
i had for the time forgotten that edith and i were leaving tonight
i admit i was attracted with a singular swiftness to the fragile golden beauty of anne forrest
whatever menace was here in this sinister household certainly it was directed at this other girl not at edith
and her whisper now was appealing
she added you and your sister i frightened i must talk to you rolf forrest was saying yes we expected anne and i to go back to nashville tonight
but the accursed bridge is down no way of getting out of here for anybody not till daylight
it brought a gasp from edith and it snapped me to alertness
marooned here
why i said nobody told us thjt
my sister and i were leaving tonight
young forrest shrugged
not a chance
you came over that bridge you know the one like a trestle nearly falling down of its own weight r he gestured
just down the cliff a hundred feet or so
that lightning flash lord wed only just gotten over the bridge when the lightning hit it he laughed
i suppose it was quite a normal laugh but it sent a shudder over me as though any form of laughter in this mysterious house must carry horror
that bridge he added just slid sidewise and fell
i looked to anne for confirmation and she nodded
mrs groff was approaching helping millie with the dessert
my husband has just been to verify the wreck of the bridge she said
it is down
on foot one might get around the canyon to the other road by daylight but it is many miles
marooned here
with the palegold beauty of anne forrest beside me i own that at that moment it did not seem so horrible a catastrophe
if i had known i i would have taken edith and anne and run out on foot to huddle through the night among the black stormswept crags if i had known murder stalks not going to sleep edith said take turns keeping awake i agreed
jttst aa a matter of precaution
but donot lets get too tense over it
i laugbed slwrtly and i was startled to see edith flash me a look as thougli to her too the sound of laughter here was frightening
mysterious damn jdaee i added patients morbid enough for anybody but i donot see any danger to us i said it lightly enough but the things i imew that edith didnot know again leaped at me
tlie luihing ludvig
a third member of this groff family
the one who held the purse strings a lustful fiend who must not be seen by us visitors or even mentioned
demoniac with his desires unspeakable so tudeous that even enifl groff was revolted at thn afraid of he cftaequent
yet emil himself had beeaond perhaps was now engaged in mttrder
and i thought of the appeal of anne forrest something was threatening her so that in her terror she had ajealed to me a i had had no opportunity yei of seeing anae alone
after supper we had all gone into a elieerless little siltii room
it was by then laearly nine oclock
we sat for perhaps half an hour discussing the storm which was raging
queer storms these of the tonuefisee mountains
the lightning bolt which had demolished the ramshackle brid was the last
no more had ome
but the wind was still high and the min was still a torrent
it seemed that anne was watching an opportunity to talk to me alone but could not find it
then her father seemed tired
they wnt to their bedrooms with the hunchback ihtle mrs groff escorting them to be sure they were comfortable and edith and i totlowed
at the top of the stairs as we all said goodnight seemed that anne flashed me a glpnce but whatever her meaning i could not determine it caai sleep if you like edith was saying
and staying here with you not iti my room
we sat together in one of the bedrooms
we had closed and locked the hall doors of both rooms and left tlie connecting door betwttn thesn en
the hotise had goite almost immediately silent
there was up here on this floor with us as far as we knew only the two girls iodced the bedroom diagonally across the hall and the forrests who had three adjacent bedrooms on this upper hall just beyond the front staircase
those two girls whose unholy laughter was so shocking to hear i sat wondering whether millie had taken their supper if any attention were being paid to them
they were silent now a silence that somehow seined more ominous even than their laughter
groffs and millie were downstairs so far as knew perhaps their bedrooms were down there
emil groff liad not appeared
and that ludwig i found that i was doaing with drifting thoughts
if only i were anned
some weapon but i had none save a very ineffectual peaknife
but i mustnot mention it to edith
tomorrow i would see anne again that hndvig would he be roaming the house now
tlie thotaght me into alertness
what is it jack nothing edith you better lie down on the bed stay awake no all right here
abruptly the small electric bulb in the was ejrtmguished
we were plunged into darioiess
jackr sit still i murmured probably itll come on in a minute but it did not through the stonn the lights of the bouse had been waverii but now it seemed permanent darkness crowded us frightened against all reason
i could hear terrified breathing her hand reached out and gripped my arm
oh jack
i said
there was a stump of candle on the table
i guess the lights up here in these mountains are never very dependable
i fumbled and found the candle lighted it
even its wavering tiny yellow glow was reassuring
then a startling thought hit me
the light was out in our adjoining room
the storm during the last half hour had seemed rapidly abating
the rain had ceased the wind was still strong but noticably less than before and outside our windows now there was fitful moonlight
queer that having weathered the storm the lights would go out now
were they out all over die house or just in our two rooms
had someone pulled out a fuse to plunge us and all the house perhaps into darkness
i went to the bedroom door with gaze upon me
what is it
jack
just want to see if the lights are out in the hall
the little hall was solidly dark
evidently every light in the house was extinguished
and there was a new silence here now a black empty silence with the rattle of rain on the roof missing and the surge of the wind almost gone so that now the silence was blank unnatural
i stood straining my hearing
was that a dim choking sound of laughter
i turned to edith
those girls i said softly laughing again
was it laughter
or something else now on impulse i crossed diagonally to the door on the other side of the hall
behind me edith stood framed in our doorway by the candlelight
i reached the other doorway
laughter
it was soft eerie
a choked laughter
i bent with my ear to the wooden panel
and i heard a blur of confused sounds
the thump of the girls moving about
and queerly gruesome sounds of their suppressed voices
giggles a laugh choking into a sob
a thump with a revolting giggling little scream
with wild rtmning thoughs i straightened to return to edith
and frozen
i stood tense with dilating nostrils
what was this i was smelling
a drift from under the girls door
a faint weird smell of which i had suddenly become aware
a stench
a perfume went back to edith closed our bedromi door and locked it in there i said
just the same laughing poor little devils maniacs there must have been some look on my face that stopped her questioning
i did not meet her gaze
lie down edith i added
the night will seem interminable if you just sit there all right
half an hour
it did indeed seem an eternity as i sat alone with my questioning thoughts
beside me fn a little wooden rocker with a bed pillow behind her edith was dozing
and suddenly in the silence i heard a tap on our bedroom door
3ft
furtive
edith sat up staring at me wordlessly
the tap came again open it edith warned as i rose
at the door i said softly who is it what you want mr baker
oh please voice
i jerked open the door and she came in like a white darting wraith the light of the candle she was carrying painting her head and neck with its yellow glow
tfow edith gasped and as i snatdied the candk anne ran to edith with a httie xxy
oh tve been so lightened i had to come to yoo
when the lights went out a while jst txjnldnot stand its i had to come she was mth and terror edith led her to the bed and sat there with arms aromid her
what is it dear frightened of course this ghastly house a girl terrified at being alone in this weird ac so ttiat she was jmpelkd to seek protection from us strangers even though her father and cousin were here with her glance questioned me
i said gently couldnot make any oppfsrtunity to talk with you
i thought tomorrow may may be too late she gasped
i suppose its just my silly fears
this thra ghasdy house as you say
btit i was afraid even before rolf brought father and me up here
my mind flung back to that altercation i had heaid at the foot of the stairs just before supper
emil groff and the mysterious ludwig
forrests are rich all been carefully plaimed
your cousin rolf brout you up here demanded
yes
father was taken ill a sort of nervous breakdown
depressed threatened with wbat they call melancholia
then rolf found this jfece
he came up here to inspect it
tb ffiey cure people here who have melancholia she sucked in her breath
depressed insanity thats what th call it when it gets worse
and rolf kiid that die cure here was wonderful and he persuaded father to come a kttle light in distant darkness i began to understand
your father is rich
i said gently
she stared
yes
and she added wiffi a stark note of terror in her voice guessing what fm thinking only ray imagination maybe but i always been alraid of rolf
he wants to marry me i donot love him afraid for yourself
i inuimured
no
afaaid for father
my father said hed never let rolf marry me
and tiieres the business the inheritance
rolf is general manager now but father doesnot like his work
they they qtiarrded a few weeks ago and fatlier threatened to have rolf leave dte and to change liis will niayte murder for a price so that was what emil groff was after big money in it no danger to us all carefully plannetb this place a murder house where one might bring his intended victim to be killed i a little of this grewsome sinfeter mysfory one angle of it at least now seemed plain
i said sviffly
is your father alone now yes
he has one bedroom is adjoining with a door between them
mine is nt to no door between you and rolf
no
and i got terrified just thinking
oh wliat are you going to do
i had seized one of the candles your father up i said have to plan some way lo guard him
in truth i had no plan save that i could not let tlat old man sleep in there alone now
if only i had a weapon
i saw now so many adversaries tonight in this sinister household
emil groff intent upon murdering this victim aided no doubt by liis malevolent gargoyle wife
and rolf forrest here to see the murder accomplished and to take the body back home with dr death certificate
and the lurking fiendish ludvig what part would he play in this both the girls were clinging to me
i said figure out some excuse to guard your father tell him you got too frightened to stay alone
then edith and i will stay with you and him they followed me clinging to me as i opened our door and raised the candle to light the dark and silent hallway
it was only fifty feet to the bedroom of father
we passed the front hall stairs
no sound
the wavering little light from my candle shone partly down the stairs with solid blackness in the lower hall
this is your fathers door anne
yes i rapped softly
i said softly mr forrest oh mr forrest wake up
the silence was wnlnous
ghastly
terrifying
the old door rattled slightly as though from a puff of wind behind it
i turned its knob and shoved but it did not yield it was locked on the inside
anne you call him edith murmured
father
father dear no answer though i rapped again much louder
it was loud enough now to arouse rolf
i turned to the adjacent door
this yes
i thumped
rolf forrest
let me ini this is jack baker
let me in
no answer
i turned the knob
the unlocked door went inward with my shove and i burst into the room with the girls behind me
it was unlighted save by an eerie shaft of moonlight from the window and now the light of my candle
the bed had not been occupied
rolf forrest was not here
to one side was the closed commimicating door to the bedroom of father
i dashed to it turned its knob
it swung and i went through
a of wind met me extinguishing my candle
the window was wide open with moonlight streaming in and a blast of the night air father lay in the bed with the covers to his chin
he seemed to be peacefully sleeping
i bent over him
pallid face in the moonlight
behind me the girls were shuddering
i said mr forrest wake up
i shook him insistently with a wave of dismay sweeping me because i knew it was futile
then i swung
you girls step back
he hes fainted i guess
anne gave a little cry and edith drew her back
both of them knew what i meant
dead
he lay here unbreathing
i jerked down the window sash i saw outside that sheer drop of a hundred feet or more down to the little canyon of the mountain torrent
then i turned back to the bed
dead unquestionably
yet so far as i could tell no mark of violence on him
no blood
no wound
no sign even tliat the bedclothes liad been rumpled
no contortion of the face nor the muscles of the limbs as one who dies by poison
what had done this what mysterious agency of murder was this to leave a peaceful unmarked corpse which rolf forrest could take back to nashville and offer for autopsy perlmps secure that no evidence of murder would exist as though to answer my unspoken question it seemed now that despite the opened window and the blast of night air there was a vague smell in the room
a stench
a perfume
indefinable dead i said gently
the two horrified girls were staring at me from the communicating doorway
i shoved them back into room and closed the door on the moonlit scene of death
we were too late anne
and what were we to do now
so many lurking adversaries here the hall door of little bedroom still was open
and abruptly all three of us stood here in the dim moonlight frozen with a new surge of horror
from outside in the hall there came the sound of drsing
a slow labored scraping on the hall floor a sound so grewsomely horrible that i stood transfixed lioldkig the two juddering girls and with my breath seeming to stidc in my throat my kps dry
the sound stopped
came again
a little louder as though nearer
tiny muffled thumps mingled with a dragging scrape
something out there in the hall dragging itself toward s
i was hardly aware that i had moved to the door stood virith the girls huddling against me so that we crowded the doorway the moonlit room behind us
the distant hall was blank darkness from out of whkh the sound was coming
the moonlight scrawled past us and laid its wan pallid glow on the hall floor in a little patch just before our door
tlie blackness was a wall beyond it
ghasfly approaclung dragging tlmmps there in the blackness
with a rush of terror so shocking to my senses tliat the grisly scene swam and blurred before nie i saw down by the flaer a head appear
a head of straggling long brown hair vild and tangled
a disembodied head
a face livid whiter contorted with mortal agony smeared with blood wild ring eyes a mouth with parted life like a crimson smear for all the noisome horror i was consefous of ray recognition
the groff maid her disembodied head hobbling here
no there was a ghastly throat now and wliite shoulders with the brown hair tangled on them
another dragging labored hitch i saw now her pitiful body lying on the flow emerging into the moonlight patch as slowly she dragged herself hitchittg on one elbow
i tried tb shove edith and anne belnnd me but like me they were staring with shocked whirling senses
millie dragging herself here in death agony lier throat a crimson gash with tlie blood streaming draining she saw me now
her hand tried to gesture her spiiig dying breath choked with blood was andible and i was aware that i had flung off tlie girls and was bending over her
millie dead
i ju fcamd him murdered his tltroat cut like mine
oh and loved him so much millie dead who murdered him her head iiad faflcn now
the blood rattled in her throat
then other words came he murdered him and did for me just now murder everybody
he is the words rattled off into the lant choldng agony of her death
her whole body twitched for a moment then lay still her white citeek the floor with a spreading crimson stain under if
room of the maniac girls stalking in the blackns of this ghastly household
old mr forrest dead here in his bed
mfllicf here in the hall with slashed throat
and some one else was murdered millie hod said
some one whose body millie had found lying somewhere here in the dark some man millie loved
who was it
the fiendish ludvig
dr emil groff
or rolf forrest
and who had murdered him
murder everylxidy
he is the choking words of the dying girl echoed in my head as i leaped to my feet
lurking stalldng fiend roaming this house with the frenzy of these murders turning him into a raging madman so tliat now he would not stop until he had murdered us all
and i was unarmed
i seized the pallid anne and edith shoved them through the doorway of the room anne had teen occupying
it had no cortimunicatii door into at other room
it was smj compact
its single window overlooked a sheer drop into the canyon no chance of an assailant coming through the window
barricaded in here we would be se the bed was a narrow iron affair
a weapon for me
edith gasped what are you doing weapon
help me
i tumbled the bedding to the floor
snatched off the mattress
lifted out the spms
a jerk and i had detached from its slot one of the iron side rails of the frame
it was nearly evcn feet long with it i could crack tlie head of any orre or anything that came near me
a frenzied panic for action was upon me
i turned to the girls
you lode yourselves in here a telephone near the foot of ffie stairs gping to call for help the police in the nearest tovn
i wonot be a minute barricade ourselves in here or we run from the house out to the windswept crags
more dangerous inside or ocrtside
who could sayyet to me then it seemed that we would be safer locked in this room than in the open moonlit wildness outside
you lock the door i reiterated open it unless you hear my voice
they nodded wordlessly
i stood with the iron bedrail in my hand listening as they icwked the door
this silent house
the grisly corpse of millie lay at my feet
brooding black silence everywhere
amazing silence
edith and anne had screamed at the horrible sight of the dying millie and certainly i had made enough clatter snatching apart the bed
yet the house stood unaroused darkly silent
where were all its other occupants two maniac girls still locked doubtless in their bedroom up here at the other end of the hall
but rolf forrest
mrs groff
emil groff and ludvig
one of them millie had said was murdered
but the others
where were they now that my commotion had not aroused them
had they vanislied like spectres
or like siillie were tliey all lyir here somewhere murdered
all but one
and that one somewhere here was lurkiflg
from the stairs i could see faint shafts of moonlight now dimly illumining the lower hall
no one nothing down there i stood on the stairs with tlie heavy bedrail poised straining my hearii as though by force of wffi i could penetrate the silence and hear this monstrous adversary
at the bottom of the steps i stood peering
wan eerie patches of moonliglit by the windows and so many shadows everywhere each of which might hold the lurking monster
there was a little moonlight glow by the wall telephone
witli every muscle alert i went there rested the heavy iron bar beside me and lifted the receiver
uncanny silence of the instrument like the uncanny silence of the house
no buzz of current no distant operators inquiring voice
and then i saw the cut wires dangling under the box
the fiend had been here
i could send no call for hp
with a deepened sense of terror i seized the bedrail and fled back up the stairs
at the door of room i rapped
i called sliarply jack let me in and as the words were still echoing i felt my heart contract as though as icy hand were clutchihg it
silence
a silence so fraught with horrible import that it whirled and blurred my senses
edith
anne
let me in
edith
answer me edith silence so horrible
i pounded the door rattled its ktrob
then i stepped backward half stumbling over the gruesome body of millie and i lunged with the heavy bedrail
the wooden casement that held the lock smashed inward
the door swung and went with it little moonlit bedroom was empty
the window locked on the inside was undisturbed but edith and anne wwe gone
a stark panic descended upon me in that terrible moment so that i lunged and flung aside the heap of bedding shoved wildly at the bureau as though by some diabolic necromancy the two girls might still be here though at a glance i had seen they were not
and then i saw where they had gone
a panel of the wall showed a narrow slit a slidir door here which when closed was undiscemable
but it was not quite closed now
a doorway to some descending secret lair
i shoved my fingers into the vertical opening the panel slid sidewise and i launched myself through brandishing the bedrail
i was merely in the adjoining bedroom a duplicate of with a white iron bed unmade moonlight through the closed window
no one here
i stooped hurriedly searching
no one
nothing
the rooms single door was ajar it admitted me back into the hall only a few feet from body
so great a terror was on me now that i was hardly conscious of rational reasoning
where had the fiend taken them
somewhere in this ghastly house ludvig lusting for pleasure lusting for the white beauty of young womanhood
the room up here in which the two maniac girls were confined had the fiend taken edith and anne there
had the maniac girls come out and lured them i dashed to that other door
it still was locked
i listened with ear to its panel
no sound
there was only my own panting breath and thumping heart
with the bedrail i burst in the door
ghastly scene
disheveled room of these maniac girls
filmy garments strewn and scattered
a place of lusting pleasure mute now with death death everywhere in this house
a gust of wind from the open window met me
and there was enough moonlight glow so that i stood gaping at the silent tragic scene
the two maniac girls were here white bodies scantily clothed hair down
one was sprawled on tlie floor with arms up on the all of the open window
the other was beside her one arm over her companions hip
both of them dead
unmarked by violence
for a moment i stood transfixed peering down at them so pallid in the moonlight
and i saw now their slim bodies revealed by death to be wasted to thinness
pitiful little creatures
maniacs only with this strange lusting spell which had been upon them
pinched thin cheeks under the rouge bodies in life consumed by the fire of their lusts so that now in death they seemed only pallid wraiths of womanhood
and on botii the contorted faces there was a frozen grimace as though even in death they were trying wildly to laugh
in that shocked moment i saw also a curious aspect to these death postures
a sort of stretching of the necks gaping stretching mouthsas though the one at the window realizing that death was upon her had staggered here flung up the sash and then fallen and on the floor had again reached upward stretching with her mouth for the air too late to save her
afid the odier weaker had seemed to have been dragging herself my mind flung back
that stench
that perfume
indefinable it was here now widening my nostrils
the room was permeated with it clinging saturating tins carpet these draperies
for all the wind from tlie opened window i smelled it now more strongly than ever before
and with every breath i was conscious of a itttle heady thrill to tny senses
gruesome lethal breaths that smed to hold a lure as i suck them in a wild pleasure of the senses that could only end in death
i gathered my wits
edith and anne were not here
i searched the room peered along the walls for some loose panel
and tlten brandishing the iron brail futilely for there seemed nothing but the dead remaming in this terrible house i fled back to the hall
the rightangle turn to the left was here i dashed around it
was that a moving sliape off there the along the iiall
i went with a wild run
no it was nothing but my memory of that shadow i had pursued here just before supper
i found myself at the head of the back stairs
the at the bottom was partly open now with a little moonlight glwing behind it
cautiously i descended
stopped to listen
only silence here
at the i shoved the door but it bumped something on the other sidesomething which partly yielded to my shov
the door moved wider with a dim scraping on the floor behind it
like millie dragging herself like i pushed myself through the dooropening
i was in a small back lower hall with a nearby window admitting moonlight
something was here on the floor at my feet i had shoved and moved it vdien i pushed the door
like millie tlw huddled 5ody of emil gfoff was lying here weltering frwn a ghastly crimson slash that almost severed the throat
this charnel house of death
i rose erect
i think vaguely i may liave heard a sound behind me but it was engulfed by a crash on ray tho world seemed to split with a roar and a burst of brilliant light so that i was conscious only that the faedrail was clattering from my hand as fell
orgy of death all my senses faded there was for me nothing but a blank abyss of empty soundless darkness
death itself may be like that
but presently after some nameless interval i was aware that i was alive
dimly conscious i could feel myseli lying on die floor with rope lashing my wrists beliiod me and wrapped around my ankles
my senses faded again but i struggled this time to hold a little something whicli was me
in the blackness there was the sound of a panting breath
the fiend was here i could feel fingers tying the rope at my ankles
the fabric of garments brushed me
and i could hear the breathing that was the swift triumph of a frenzy aboirt to be consummated
then i was being carried half carried half dragged with head and shoulders raised and my legs trailing on the floor as this gibbering adversary tugged and panted with my sixfoot bulk
and sight dimly was coming to me
vague moonlight
this was the narrow back hallway along which i was being dragged
a door opened
i was jerked through tumbled to what seemed the softness of a rug
strange smell here
a perfume
distinctly a perfume now
exotic aromatic smell like some powerful incense burning here
i heard the door slam closed
and at my appearance there had seaned the dim blurred sound of a girls terrified cry
edith anne memory of them snatched my senses to greater alertness
i was conscious of a throbbing pain at the back of my head my hair wet and matted doubtless with blood
but the horrible weakness was leaving me strength coming back to my limp muscles all my confused senses sharpening clarifying
i was in a dimly candlelit apartment draped and shrouded
heavily carpeted soft chairs couches wall rugs and hangings great splashes of red and black velvet
macabre interior
paintings on the walls with the flickering candelight vaguely disclosing their voluptuous nudities
a guttural voice at my ear said oh you are not dead
that i hoped
a grim gibbering chuckle unlioly laugh that had nothing of mirth in it but only horror
then you sit here and watch
you will enjoy this before you die i saw above me the leering malevolently vile face of mrs groff
gargoyle woman fiend with her bent thick body like a gorilla of amazing strength
the prim black taffeta dress was bloodsoaked now
she stood shaking trembling with the frenzy of murderous demoniac triumph
you sit here and watch
beside him myself being propped up like a bent bundle on the floor with cushions behind me
another figure was here
ghastly shape sagging here beside me
i turned my head to regard it
rolf forrest
he sagged here propped by cushions so that he could not fall but slumped with dangling head against his chest
grisly companion
his face was livid bloodstreaked blood welled from a wound in his side a great slash which had ripped his shirt half from him exposing his crimsoned flesh
no he was still breathing faint gasping breaths of unconsciousness
swift disclosures
no more than half a minute had passed since i was flung into this i heard again that girls cry and with senses at last fully clarified i saw across the long apartment in shadows beyond the candlelight a broad couch of black and red drapes
edith and anne were huddling there
unharmed save by the extremity of tlieir terror they crouched clinging to each other disheveled with hair tumbling to their shoulders and their clothing half tom from them
the thick gargoyle shape of mrs groff swung away from me and then came back
maniacal glittering eyes gibbering unholy laughter hideous face so frenzied now that it was contorted beyond semblance of either woman or man so that it was only a monster
you two will watch that will be pleasure indeed for us all
him i did not mean to kill not just yet but he nuide me with his hting she leered down at me and young forrest then like a gorilla she swayed away
at the wall where now she stopped for a i saw a row of huge upright steel cylinders each tall as a naan with a pressuregage on top
she opened their valves now
in the sudden silence i could hear the gas hissing out to mingle with the perfume of the incense which drifted in a lazy cloud from a brazier on the table
then she was at the couch where edith and anne lay pawing at them with quivering hands
oh you are afraid of me
little beautiful ones you so slim and dark and you pale like white gold i tugged frantically futilely at ray bonds
beside me the dying rolf twitched and anne shcank back before her clawa litde as though he too were spurred to frenaied eflort
edith now was screaming as the vile img pawed her
trou are afraid of met you want me not to toudi youl but is is pleasure little ones
tlie smgil of pleasure will be with us in a moment
you hear it hiss yoa begin to snidl it now
you fed its caress
you must laugh now and be happy
it ts the smell f laughter the intoxieadon of imaghter the thrill of doing everythmg yrair senses you to do and laughing femghk raging maniac now
and as i panted jerking at the ropes that lasted me i could fed niy noss diiatiug
that little heady thrill to my senses with every i choked bade a grim laugh
godl why coaid i laugh wliea horror tingled every fiber of me
then the enoked voice rose louder he laughed
we must all laughl abruptly the caressing tone turned to rage and you resist me
yon will not lose your seises to the pleasures tliat are coming
because i am a woman
suddeidy the clawlike liands swept up to her head
the primly parted liair was snatidied away to become a wig wildly flung across the room
this demoniac fiend not a woman
i saw his bullet head of closeclipped black hair and iiow with clawing hands he tore away the taffeta waist aiid wliite ruching so that from under it lus muscular hairy chest seemed to burst out freed of its pinching garment
see my beautiful dear ones he stood swaying before the couch gorilla now indeed in every physical aspect
see
the woman you thought m is gone mrs groff gone never existing i am ludvig master of pleasure master of laughter the girls were screaming again as he readied to dutdi them ludvig
my half drugged sens whirled with complete realization
this chamal house of death we the living the only survivors now were all gathered here in this room of lust
ludvig
eftiil older brother who masqueraded always as the wife of dr emil groff to give a greater semblance of respectability to this supposed sanitorium to give him also a greater freedom wtffi the young girl patients who had been admitted here until with the spell of lusting laughter upon them he could dlsdose himself as a man diabolic sted cylinders
compressed oxygen
diltrted in the air as norraahy we iweathe h oxygen is lifegiving
i think ill the case of father nstlung but pure oxygen was used we later found the tubes under his bed leading it from tanks at a distant part of the house
he had gone to sleep perhaps with a sedative
his window had been ordered closed against the storm and then tlift oxygen had been introduced
strange device for murder
an of the heart whidi in the old mans case emil groff had known would certainly kill irim quickly
and from the blood and tissues of sudi a murdered victim the overcharge of pure oxygen quickly evapomte so tiiat no autopsy can discover the cause of death
unique murder plot
etnil groff doubtless had been successful with it many times
but the halfmad ludvig was not interested
what diabolic other gases he mixed with the oxygen to create in his girl victims the lust that enslaved them has never been disclosed i had almost overheard the murder of emil for unquestionably that quarrel at the foot
rf the back stairs had led ludvig to an impulsive slashing of his younger brothers throat
for litdvig then the die was cast
whatever vestige of reason he had ever possessed must have been swept into maniacal frenzy then with his brother lying weltering before him so that ludvig saw only that he must kill every one here
with me perhaps his most feared antagonist still alive and edith and anne still with me his twisted brain must have told him to hide the evidence of the gas so that he crept through the wall panel with which most of these rooms were equipped opened old mr window and verified that the old man was dead
and with each ghastly murder frenzy was telling him that he was nearing undisturbed possession of anne and edith
the culmination of his unholy lusts now was at hand
the dim candlelit room here had once been a storeroom back of the kitchen equipped by ludvig for the lair of his orgies
and he was laughing now with his triumph so near
you feel it now little white beauties
you breathe its thrill
intoxicating pleasure and i could feel it now more overwhelming with every breath
a exultant pound of my heart
a wild sense of power
desires stirring in me an intoxication of the senses a falling away of shackles of restraint which always before had been upon me and my animal desires god
was i laughing
was that wild laiigh of intoxication ringing out mingled with her halfchoked screams of horror
i saw the hideous monstrous form of the half clothed ludvig reaching across the couch the white intoxicated shuddering girls all the pounding wildness of my newfound strength still the damnable rope was holding me
my lunges bumped the body of rolf forrest
he slumped against me
his contorted face twitched not quite dead for the oxygen was bringing a last little strength to hold death away a moment icmger
and what was this almost vacant eyes imploring me
a little twitch at my lashed wrists behind me
his dying twitching fingers with a little stimulated strength in tltem plucking at my bonds
his numbing brain with death creeping into it still could direct his twitching fingers then the death rattle was in his throat a shudder swept him a twitching and then he slumped and fell forward on his face and lay motionless
i jerked and found that my arms were free
i fumbled at my ankles tast off the last of the rope and sprang erect
ludvig did not see me as i bounded the twenty feet across the heavy red carpet
he was sprawled forward on the couch laugiiing pawing
with a last bound like a pouncing animal i was on him lifting his hideous vile little body with all the amazing power of my intoxicated strength so that i shook him as though he were a gigantic rat and whirled and pounded his gargoyle head aginst the nearest of the steel cylinders
pounded and laughed with my own wild unholy laughter until his head cracked and i cast him dead upon the floor
edith
anne come with my arms around them we ran slamming the door upon the ghastly room
and up in the house i wrapped their shuddering bodies in blankets and we sat through the night waiting for the dawn of tke rolseri bladkmon
author of cjvrrfw ele evulsion sintey lithe body as he clown at the figure of john eellam in the mountain cottage hedixiotn thin body tapering slowly from bony legs to narrow shoulders itjiade a strangely reptilian shape beneath the it was a strange sickness that assailed john bellam for his skin had become covered with reptilian scales and every dawn revealed some body crushed as though by a huge serpent bed covers
hakes of dead cuticle covered every visible fndi of his skin rimming hfs pale lips and surrounding his closespaced eyes which were bright and ophidian in their fixity
his wrists and hands covered with tlie dry scales and thrusting from his pajama sleeves were like broadheaded serpents nesting in the bed linen
mary bellam had told stanley thather uncle john bellam owner of greater circus was recovering from a skin disorder but the warning had not prepared the young lawyer for anything like this
he must have shuddered for warm hands tightened reassuringly upon his arm
mary has chosen well
the words hissed from lips
his cold eyes moved slowly from polished shoes to the strong breadth of his shoulders the firm set of his wellslaaped head
bellajn moved one hand the long scaled fingers coiling palmward and the brown hair prickled along the back of necl wish you both great happiness
thank you mr bellam impulsively right hand thrust forward and he took another step toward the bed then horror chilled him as mary clutched frantically at his arm
stan
no
her voice was a terrified wail touch me john bellam recoiled with the swiftness of a serptent
you might abruptly his thin body relaxed
sorry to frighten you but were not sure about this
his right hand slid across his chest moving with the slow grace of a reptile
greater circus specializes in giant pythons and boas
i have always loved snakes
since this happened a month ago wondered if handling the big snakes could have he stopped as the door behind stanley and mary opened
stanley turned and gulped as a squat misshapen man waddled into the room
the mans big eyes bulging almost level with jutting brows slid over him then flicked to the bed
he was strangely nervous and frightened
you call misser bdla
his voice was a throaty croak
no tongue darted out to moisten pale lips
mr austin this is shagar
he was my snakeman until a maddened python attacked him glittering eyes seemed to mock the squat figure beside the bed
shagar hates snakes
oddly he believes i am becoming a giant python rustling chuckle made scalp tighten believe shagar hates me for gnarled fingers clasped nervously
his bulging eyes darted fearfully about the room and stanley saw terror in their colorless depths hate snake
i no hate you misser enough hand lifted a scaled reptile rearing its broad flat head
mary you elbert weiss and shagar are circus folks you have cared for me in spite of this
therefore i shall make arrangements to leave each of you a third interest in greater circus
i shall be dead within the week
uncle john
stanley felt slim body quiver against him
you shotddnot permit yourself mr bellam to he began uncomfortably shanot bright eyes slitted and stanley felt a chill feeling that was half fear creep through his veins regret dying a human and tamely in bed glittering eyes seemed to stare through and beyond the three beside the bed prefer the swift death of the jungle the stunning impact of a lightning thrust from overhanging branches the anasthesia of fear
then coil after coil of steelcabled body please sharpened voice
your pardon mary
suddenly lams voice was mild and lulling
where is elbert shagar
he he go see dog
the twisted body seemed to shrink
dog
something ketch dog back of cottage
shagar said squirming nervously his bulging eyes wide with terror
it it squeeze dog dead
his voice dropped to a terrified whisper
it kill like big python t python
breath whistled shrilly from slitted nostrils fear froze his thin scaled features and his voice was the voice of a damned being
merciful god have i already hello everybody the nasal voice came from behind stanley
he swung about and saw a wellbuilt man of about thirty standing in the open doorway
the newcomer was tall and muscular and his sleek hair glistened in the afternoon light coming from the open front door at the end of the hall
oh pardon me
his black eyes appraised stanley know we had company
mr weiss this is stan stanley austin mary said and clung tightly to arm
congrats and all that stan lucky
the pressure of weiss hand upon was quick and strong
next thursday so mary says a prize but warning you marrying into a circus crowd
of course not really one of the family but certainly you are elbert said bellam as his pale lips bared long fanglike teeth in a fond smrle been with me for years and youll share equally with mary and shagar in the circus after gone
we thanks mr bellam
but lets not talk about your going
weiss stepped to the bed clasping longfingered hands behind his back
his black eyes darted to twisted figure
shagar told you about the dog eh elbert
is it true
was the animal really bellam had risen to a sitting position and his closespaced eyes were filled with stark terror
it was
weiss eyes lifted from scaled body and stanley saw his lips tighten
the dog was crushed apparently by a huge snake but that of course is impossible
a boa anaconda or a python couldnot live in this mouittain climate
it he snapped long fingers almost forgot going to have more company
i saw herman big red car coming up the road probably after circus again
consolidating and would make the biggest combination in if that scoundrel slitted eyes were flaming with hate
hi
anybody home
the big voice boomed through the cottage
the screen door banged and heavy feet stamped toward the bedroom
hi elbert you get puttier and puttier mary hi john stanley didnot have to be told that the heavyjowled giant barging into the bedroom was herman kelley owner of shows
heard you was sick john so i come to see you big feet slapped the floor toward the bed
his little piggish eyes swept stanley from head to foot
mary introduced them
glad to know any guy mary knows
kelley grinned and turned to the bed
now john herman kelley the words spat from lips
he drew away from the rival show owner like a snake settling to strike
if youve come up here to easy john said kelley spreading a beefy hand
my shows playing maxton four miles over the hills
i heard you was sick so i come over to abruptly heavy jaw dropped and he backed away from the bed
holy cats john
yon got acales like a snake uncle john has malignant eczema
mary spce kidnaafly as she left stanley md moved toward the bed her curly bkmd head high
he is no condition to okay
cay
it it just gimme a turn seeing them scales
kdley mopped at his beefy face with a handkenchief
i been catching hell with snakes latdy
bought some boas and pythons from a busted show and the damn worms been driving me nats
the biggest python got away in maxton
got away
mary screamed in a way that made teeth dick together
then the dog was you youre bunting for the snake
the wwds pushed from tight throat
the crushed dog perhaps a crushed liuman nex his eyes sought trim blond figure and a shudder rippled through his body
hunting it kelley snorted should delay the show and waste a thousand bucks for a fiftydollar worm
the damn thing canot live in these mountaoie
it brfongs to the guy who finds it then a grin split red face yet his keen little eyes watched every move
how bout five grand over my last offer for cireus laid up and there ainot no telling how get sharp hiss drove the larger man back
kelley barged to the door then stopped turned and leveled a diick finger
you might jests well sell me the show john he boomed eyes narrowed get it sooner or later
ilieu kelley was gone his heavy feet pounding out of the cottage the dpg elbert weiss slightly ahead of stanley austin and shagar pointed through the thin growth of pines and underbrush in the narrow behind the mountain cottage
two strides of long legs brought him beside elbert
shagar waddled at the lawyers heels
directly before the three men a shapeless bundle of brownishgray fur huddled upon the needlecarpeted ground bright afternoon sun sifted through the trees and splashed the ghastly object with shafts of lht
elbert moved toward the thing
stanley follow
he could hear shagar waddling behind him twisted snakeman was muttering viciously beneath his breath
they reached the crushed carcass and a strange mingfing of nausea and fear gripped stanley austin
tlie animal had been a welldeveloped german dog
now it was but a horribly shapeless mass f blooddotted fiir
a throaty croak made scalp tighten before he realized the sound was coming frexn shagar
the crippled snakeman was staring down at the crushed dog his bulging eyes glazed with horror
python do that
a shudder twitched squat misshapen body
most do me like that
misser bella watch
laugh like he glad i hurt
he been punch snake make him mad
he hate me croaking voice went shrill
he like to kill me
misser bella talk to snake tell him to squeeze me
snake talk to him hiss
misser bella always halfsndce
he be all snake quick
he ketch me do me like that he squeeze me squeeze more people like nonsense shagar
elbert weiss laugh was strained
he wetted his lips nervously forget the crazy stuff
he seemed fordbly tq tear his black eyes from the dogs crushed body got to get that python
you take the other side of the you know what to do
stanley youd better go to the little ing about a quarter mile down the valley
if the python comes near you sing out
shagar and be witli you in two minutes going up the valley and work back
we ought to have a few more men but well lets go
elbert stalked off through the trees heading toward the left
still muttering shagar waddled past the dogs carcass and headed across the valley
stanley could hear him slipping on the pine needles after his twisted figure had disappeared behind the trees
the young lawyer started down the valley his muscular fingers tight about the short club he had picked up near the cottage
elbert had said the python would be unlikely to measure over eighteen feet and it would undoubtedly be sluggish halfdormant
yet a tight smile touched firm lips as he moved forward cautiously brown eyes probing the trees and brush about him
the pines thinned and disappeared after he had walked a few moments
stanley was coming into a small irregular clearing rimmed with the scrubby trees and underbrush
afternoon sunlight made the place look almost cheery yet strange thoughts thrust into mind
was john bellam actually being transformed into a reptile were those ghastly scales upon his skin but a forerunner of the horror to come
had bellam as shagar charged deliberately prodded the python into attacking the snakeman
could the strangely reptilian circus owner actually talk with snakes speak their hissing language
had the police dc been attacked by tlie python that liad escaped from shows or had it been crushed by john bellam whose thin scaled body was snakelike in its a derisive laugh burst from lips
he was letting the queer happenings break his nerve
the whole thing was sane enough just a skin disease a crippled and halfmad snakeman and an escaped python
yet underbrush rustled nearby and every muscle in his bbdy snapped taut
his fingers went white about the short club
bleak with a sudden almost numbing fear his brown eyes probed between the surrounding trees
a slight movement caught his eyes then a small bird darted up from the ground
the lawyer relaxed and grunted as he realized that the muscles of fais jaws ached
resolutely he started to whistle but he stopped as he recalled reading somewhere that reptiles were peculiarly steceptible to shrill noises
damn circuses and snakes
after he and mary were married sudden horror held stanley motionless and the abrupt poimding of his heart all but drowned the shrill scream ringing in the narrow wooded valley
it was the terrified scream of a man in the maddening throes of infinite agony
it came again
stanley stood rigid
the cry was coming from the rt side of the valley
it knifed his eardrums again dien stopped choking short with a gurgling moan
for a moment the valley was gripped in awful silence
then stanley heard a heavy body breaking through the brush to his left
shagar
weiss
his voice sounded queer shrill in his ears
he broke into a stumbling run toward the sound his fingers glued to the short club in his right hand
swaying tree branches plucked at his clothing
underbrush whipped at his legs
yet he stumbled on the horrible cry still echoing in his brain
after a few moments he stopped every faculty concentrated on listening
the noise of breakii brush had ceased and there was no sound but the throb of blood in his ears the eerie whisper of wind in the trees about him
he moved forward cautiously his aching eyes probing the brush
a shapeless mass upon the ground some distance ahead drew his gaze like a magnet
cold horror swelled in his brain waves of ausea swept over him and the dread certainty that the shape was human grew in his mind
gritting hie teeth to steady jerking nerves he forced himself toward the ghastly shape
it was a man a man whose body was crusted into a mocking travesty of a human form
there were no definable outlines to the horribly shapeless mass
it was but a ghastly huddle of crushed flesh bone and btoodsoaked clothing
controlling himself with an effort staidey forced himself to examine the thing
it was shagar the crippled snakeman features were bloated
his colorless eyes had burst from their sockets horrible globes pendant from red veins and muscles
trickles of blood streaked his cheeks
his mouth was fixed in a grimace of agony
the side of his head was bruised
his body was a bloodseeping pulp
john mad words flashed into diilled mind as he stared down at the crushed snakeman
the stunning impact of a lightning thrust from overhanging branches the anesthesia of fear
then coil after coil of steelcabled body stanley spun his right fist white about the short dub ald prickles racing along his spine had moved in the trees behind him
he heard it again then saw the figure of a man coming through the underbrush
stanly i shagar cried elbert weiss
he broke from the trees and ran toward stanley his face deathly pale
my god stanleyl glad youre unhurt heard he saw crushed body behind the young lawyer and his black eyes went wide filled with horror
it it got shagar
i was afraid it was you
i he raked sweat from his forehead with shaking fingers
he stopped froze into an attitude of listening then stanley heard some one lowing through tlie brush toward them
hil shagar shouted herman big voice
in a moment the showman came into sight his b body crashing toward them
heard a goshawful screech aud thought mebbe better see whats what
you got any idi what then kelley saw pulped body
holy god his voice was but a hoarse croak
the pytlion your python
elbert weiss voice was brittle
my python hell
i give the snake to john
kelley whipped about with surprising swiftness and gripped stanley arm
you vas a witness austin
you got to say i give the snake to john
i ainot responsible for this
his bulging eyes fought clear of crushed figure you happen to come up here
swift tljoughts clicked in mind
you canot pull me in on this roared kelley big hands clenching left the cottage stopped at the store and talked a bit
miss mary come in and i left started across the valley in my car
then i heard the screech and come up and you saw mary bellam at the store
the words exploded from lips
sure
she musta come down after something
it ainot but a halfmile from the cottage to kelley stalled bulging eyes following stanley as the young lawyer whipped past him moving with a swift groundeatihg stride you to tlie cottage
stanley flung the words over his shoulder
john up there alone and out where that python can attack her he increased his pace to a run heard kelley and weiss pounding after him
reaching the cottage stanley crossed the front porch legs stiff cold horror gnawing at his heart
the place was quiet with a queerly sinister silence
kelley and weiss burst from the trees about the cottage and trotted toward the porch
mary mr bellam the silent empty cottage seemed to engulf call
there was no answering sound
he pushed through the open doorway striding toward the door to the room
he heard weiss and kelley on the front porch room door was open and stanley saw the bed at the first glance
it was empty the covers thrown back
there was no sign of thin scaled figure
mad thoughts churned in mind
we got to get together on this thing elbert bull voice drifted in from the porch weiss nasal tones answered now a case of getting weiss stopped then his voice was shrill and high
mary now coming up tlie stanley reached the front door as the car neared the cottage
kelley and weiss were running toward the road
mary bellam seemed lost behind the wheel of the big sedan
her blue eyes went big and frightened as she braked the car to a stop
weiss and kelley crowded to the opened left window
stanley strode across the porch ran toward the car
why did you leave mr bellam
elbert weiss was reaching for the door handle
stanley caught his arm and pulled him away
you heard me give the damn snake to john mary big head was thrust through the opened window
you got to witness muscular hand upon his shoulder stopped him
the yotmg lawyer pulled kelley away from the car
take it easy you two
stan
something terrible has happened slim hands were warm on wrist
uncle john sent me to the store for cigars
something has happened to him
tell me stan
she pushed the car door open and stepped to the road frightened eyes seeking the cottage door gone blurted weiss long fingers clasping nervously
the python killed shagar
oh mary swayed against stanley
a dry sob choked in her throat
weiss said stanley as his arm tightened about quivering shoulders suppose you take the car and notify the sheriff and coroner
coroner hell bellowed kelley
we donot want law in this yet find bellam and the python then holler cop ril get a gang of showhands
before either stanley or weiss could stop him kelley was in the bellam sedan and had it swinging about heading down the valley in a cloud of dust
why the dirty burning anger flamed in elbert weiss black eyes as he stared at the speeding car
a deep frown creased broad forehead and his lips tightened grimly as he watched the sedan disappear around a turn
herman kelley was after greater circus
he had been in the valley when shagar screamed
could the beefy showman have planned to murder all but one of heirs before killing bellam himself then buy the show from the survivor kelley didnot want the police yet
could that mean he was using his supposed trip to maxton or showhands as atover for another murder
was john bellam alive or had kelley watched the cottage waited bdlam was alone then elbert austin faint cry was coming from the narrow valley behind the mountain cottage d the eerie tones seemed to pluck with chill fingers at nerves
it its uncle john
mary clutching fingers dug into arm
elbert weiss was already running toward the sound
stanley started after him mary dragging at his arm and as they sped toward the narrow wooded valley behind die cottage a dread certainty grew in mind
each one of these strange happenings was but part of a mad plan
each incident was leading to a hideous deathfilled climax
mr bellam
he heard elbert weiss running through the brush ahead
mary was stumbling panting at hife side
stanley
elbert
john shrill cry came from ditiy to the left
stanley clianged his course elbert weiss helping mary through the entangling underbrush
then they saw the tliin pajamaclad figure of john bellam ahead through the trees and stanley thought of a horrible halfreptile creature wandering in the wooded valley reached the circus owner and again revulsion swept over stanley austin as he looked at the dry scalelike flakes of dead cuticle on skin
a queer tightening came into the young lawyers body
something has happened to shagar narrow head thrust forward as he hissed the words the head of a scaled reptile upon a thin upright body heard him scream it was like his scream when he was attacked by tlie python
bdkm pawed at his narrow forehead and the dry rasp of scales sent prickles of horror through tight scalp
circus dks feel death ophidian eyes were unnaturally bright and uiiwinkiug knovif shagar is dead
his thin body swayed a queer sinuous movement
take me to his body
stanley austin felt the hair rising upon his head
bellam had sent mary away from the cottage
he had been alone
he hated shagar had according to the crippled snakeman prodded a python into attacking him before could have slipped from the cottage crossed the valley and stanley shuddered
shagar liad said bellam was halfsnake could talk the hissing language of serpents
shagar had predicted his own death in the crushing coils of a snake
he had said that bellam would be that serpent
had the crippled snakeman possessed some horrible secret knowledge about john bellam
had he been crushed because of that knowledge take me to shagar
john tlim figure weaved in a loathswne serpentine movement
his sharp tongue licked pale lips avidly
a queer hungry gleam burned in his unwinking eyes
his cold fixed stare fastened upon elbert weiss
take me to shagar elbert he commanded hissingly
weiss lifted muscular shoulders in an expressive shrug turned and started off through the trees heading for the spot where stanley had found the crippled horribly crushed body
muscles hard with a strange tautness stanley followed
mary walked at his side her trembling hands clutching his arm
the sinking sun painted darkening shadows in the narrow a slight evening breeze had started and faint eerie whispers drifted through the stopped warned by something he could not define
quickening blood pumped in his ears
his lips felt parched and dry
his right hand clenched then he remembered he had dropped his short club near the cottage
beside him mary bellam stood stiffly her frightened breath shrill in his ears
he could feel her slim figure trembling against him
his bleak eyes probed the trees ahead
then the something which had warned him became apparent
elbert weiss and john bellamys thin pajamaclad figure were nowhere in sight
no sound came from the trees and brush ahead
slowly stanley moved forward fingers knotted into hard fists
mary walked at his side held silent by his tenseness
as they passed a low mass of brush stanley heard a furtive rustle behind him
chilled breath stopped in his throat
the skin of his back crawled with sudden numbing horror and john strange words flashed into his mind
the stunning impact of a lightning thrust from overhanging branches the anesthesia of fear
then coil after coil of steelcabled body instinctively he pushed mary away from him and svmng about his fists knotted around he was aware of a vague something lashing out from the brush
a smashing weight crashed into the side of his head
lights flamed within his skull terrified scream reached his ears seeming to come from an incredible distance
a sable pall tightened about him
something hard and round encircled his body yet he couldnot move couldnot scream the terror swelling in his lungs
merciful unconsciousness engulfed him became aware of a strange acrid smell a nervetightening odor that had a rank corrosive quality about it
it was somehow unutterably slimy and unclean
then abruptiy he knew what it was the nauseous stench of reptiles his eyes snapped open and a startled cry ruslied to his lips and stopped
he was gagged bound hand and foot and lying upon the rough stone floor of a large cave
to his right he could see mary slim figure
the girl was also bound and a gag bit into the soft flesh of her cheeks
she was unconscious her eyes closed
still dazed by the blow upon his head stanley looked about him
farther toward the back of the cavern was a queer structure of heavy beams and coils of heavy hawserlike rope
he saw a powerful hydraulic jack
the shadowy figure of a man was crouched behind the crude machine eyes swept past the man drawn irresistibly toward the back of the cave then the noisome gag between his teeth flung back the scream of horror that tried to burst from his tight lungs
the dusky shadows at the back of the cavern held the coiled bulk of a giant python he could see the sinuous coils of its huge scaled body the blynt triangle of its head
its eyes made tiny points of light in the shadows
it seemed dormant
yet there was a certain pulsing of life about the giant bulk eyes swung back to the crouched shape of the man the crude machine and the hideous solution of the whole mad scheme burst like a blinding flame within his brain
he knew now the purpose of the ropes and beams knew the identity of the kneeling man
a ghastly vision of crushed body swam before his eyes
he knew now why he and mary had been brought to this cavern
frantically he tried to burst free of the ropes about his wrists
warm blood crawled upon his skin as the rough hemp bit into his flesh
he saw now that a mans head thrust above the coils of rope between the heavy beams
the features were all but obscured by the thick folds of a gag yet stanley knew who it was john bellam
stanley threw every ounce of his strength into straining against the ropes but they held fast
a groan of despair forced from his tiglit lips
warned by the sound the figure crouched beltmd the machine straightened turned
stanley knew his identic before he rose
it was elbert weiss
wdll
well brave lover is awake
a hacking laugh rasped from weis leering mouth
id his find plenty whai they come back
weiss bent released the big hydraulic jack and the thick ropes about thin figure loosened
he pulled the sliapeless mass that had been body from the madiine flung it over his shoulder and stalked toward the front of the cave find bellam and you crashed by the python and theyll find body in the coils of my prize beauty he jerked his head tovrard the rear of the cave will own circus
in a few months kelley and i will consolidate the greatest and biggest siiow m earth and own half of it
chuckling throatily weiss strode out of the cave carrying crushed figure
stanley tore at the ropes about his wrists a rising sense of defeat beating at his mind
bellam was already dead crushed in the liydraulic he and mary would be next
grinding his teeth into the wadded cloth in his moutti stanley tried to push the gag free tried to shout
then he heard weiss returning my turn now
miss bellam
weiss stalked to bound figure and stared down at her black eyes flaming with mad hate eyes snapped open filled with terror as she saw him looked on me as a bum and a common circus imnd ever since been wth always avoided me but you canot now
weiss voice dripped venom
within ten minutes youll be dead and own show
shagar was easy
he died without a struggle in my machine but saving the live snake for you
miss bellam watch and laugh as it crushes you
your lover can watch too but he wonot laugh be fighting the ropes in my mechanical python i after you two are dead put you and the python in the for kelley and his men to find be at the other end of the valley hunting for you
picking the girl from the floor weiss carried her to the back of the cavern dropped her upon the coiled python and stepped back a mad snarling laugh from his lips
the huge serpents angry hiss filled the cave and eyes widened with horror as he saw the deadly mottled body sliding about mary enfolding her in its ghastly embrace
the young lawyer exploded in a mad effort to burst the ropes about his hands dropped back his tortured muscles rebelled under the strain
the pjthon had looped two coils about slim figure one about her waist the other abotrt the fresh plumpness of her breasts
the girl was paralyzed with terror the anesthesia of fear
stanley tried to jerk erect and a sharp projection of rock beneath him gouged into his pressing hands cutting the flesh
abruptly he stiffened and new hope flashed into his mind
feverishly he latruned his bound wrists on the sliarp rock and a sob caught in his throat as the benrp snagged on the projection
in less than a raimite several strands of the rope had parted
weiss was standing near the pjrthon unholy ndcrest glraming in hfe black eyes as he watched the snake cotlitig about the girl
the serpents mottled body wtis waving slowly about mary
one coif had trapped her another aboul tier thighs
even as stanfey stared tlie looped anodier ceil about the girls shoulders and he could see steelcahled mtsdes crawling breath the rep tifs mettled skin as it tightened about ks terrified ptey
cbogesled biood darkened face as he put every atom of hh strength into the effort of freeing his hands roopeot breath ewdled hia lungs by sheer despair he atramed at the ropes
flesh and bone threatened to give under the strain
iien sdirupdy something mapped
he idt the weakened heo dadien about tns wrists
madly he clawed free of the bomk lurched to his span and irurlcd his tall figure at stanley as the latter stinnbfed mary bellani
the young lawyer met his rush with a flying right fist that barbed squarely on weiss mouth
the mad killer swung his feet in a vicious kick that raised skin from shins right fist stabbed at weiss face again connected and a sharp grinding pain shot up to the lawyers right as he felt hot blood gush over his knurides
weiss shot toward tlie ba of the cave as thouglt catapulted his muscular body squirming as he tried to keep his balance
he smashed into the rock wall and dropped to the floor still squirming
stenley lunged for the hissing python weiss statement ckmoring in his brain
a man could handle tlie big snake ks stiff fingers toudied the reptile and the scafy feel of its body sent waves of horror through his ihfte figure
tearing frantically at the engulfing coils he freed holders stabbed at the reptiles weaving bead witli bloody hands
sluggiridy it tried to trap him in its mottled coils
he free tore the slimy body from about mary as eer terror and horror gave added stretth to his mosdes
the girl was unconscious
stardey putted her free caugbt lier lia figure in bis suuis and stumbled toward the mouth of the cave die angry hiss of the sfoggkh python eehoit in his ears
a qoidc gianced showed him elbert weiss ndling over trying to get to his feet but stanley strode on mary bellam mhtsarms
the sound of underbrush in the woods nearby stopped him at the cave mouth and in a second he saw herman big bulk plowing through the bushes toward the cave
six thickshoulcfered ipirities buret from the woods behind the big showowner
all them carried ropes and eltdis
hi stan
i broo tiw boys find that a slrriil maddening scream burst from the cave oiouth the scream of a num faced by horror and stanley thout of weiss almost helpless
the young lawyer shuddered
what the kelley stared at bound figure hfs piglike es wide
get your men in the cave kelley
stanley worked at the gag and ropes about mary white flesli
try to save both of the snakes in there
come up to the cottage after you are througli wtplain the whole thing to the coroner ami the police a a curse older than confucius threatened the lovely body of liu mei a curse gordon uais laughed at until she disappeared mysteriously from his very arms only to reappear after he was doomed and helpless in a chamber of dread surrounded by lustmad coolies whose master demanded of her a sacrifice that could be conceived by no brain not spawned in hell
a fog over new we heard the dismsd wailing of distant chinatown from the rivers foghorns the very soul it seemed of and the sound
now and again chinatown itself
chinese music came by of af 14etuter etc tlirough too from many hidden places and it was to me a cry from the heart of china
i waited there in the sitting room of liu ti for him to tell me why he had asked me to come have come to him around the world and he knew it
for forty years my father had been his friend and his fathers friend in china
liu ti and my father had been bloodbrothers had mingled their blood from cuts in their strong right forearmsv too knew china
i had spent all of my boyhood and most of my young man107 a weirdly moving novelette chftrged with the ominous mystery of the east hood there and had learned to love it
it is a dangerous thing i am asking you to do gordon bais said liu ti
i didnot answer
i looked at his niece gorgeous liu mei and knew that it had to do with her
did she know my secret this liu mei
did kwan tao know it
kwan tao the dusky stalwart young chinese who stood beside her i doubted it
i had never told it to a soul though liu mei must have read it in my eyes
we had been children together had almost grown up together
her father had married one of liu sisters and her father had been an american
in the eyes of her world and mine she was an eurasian neither chinese nor foreign
i looked at her and thought of how cruel people could be to one another
in the veins of my niece said liu ti almost in a whisper runs the proud blood of kings
she was the most gorgeous woman i have ever seen
her hair and eyes were black and she bad the delicate beauty which must have been that of kwan yin goddess of mercy when she had been a mortal walking the earth am ready to do anything old friend i said to liu ti know
there has always been a bond between us and between thee and liu mei
you played together as children
now gordon bais take her away and cherish her
i gasped in amazement
i think my surprise must have made me look ridiculous
but kwan tao to whom you have promised her it can not come to pass just now
gordon a shadow of which i can give you but the slightest hint hangs over the houses of liu and kwan
it means death i it whispers in the wind across the windows
it sighs in the fog
it moans in the sounds from the river
take her away with you quickly
for you an american it may be possible
i looked at liu mei
just to meet her eyes had countless times caused my heart almost to stop beating
she didnot smile
her lips were white and terror was in her face as it was in the eyes of liu ti and kwan tao
there were beads of sweat on the forehead of liu ti and he was of the old school one of those whose faces did not cliange even under torture if asked you gordon said liu mei herself
anything runt i said you know that
fd called her runt when we had been brats together in canton
but what of kwan tao i looked at her fiance trying to figure it out liu ti spoke again
it is better you did not know
liu mei knows little which she may tell you when she is safely away with one who loves her
later perhaps kwan tao the weirdness of chinatown of china transplanted chilled me
again i was conscious of the dismal foghorns of the creepy mist that swathed the windows of the strange music from the heart of chinatown
nobody will bother a foreigner behind whom is the threat of the foreign police said liu ti
you will go forth unmolested
it will be thought that because all of the blood in her veins is not chinese i have ast her out to become a member of her fathers people
i could see the scheme then and it seemed mad yet perhaps the only one that might work
and i knew something of the frightful fury of nameless shadows in chinatown shall guard her until i have word from you as though she were my sister which almost she is
it was knowing this that made me send for you
i have never asked before
a liu mel tali for a chinese girl dressed in occidental garb came to me then smiling a little and gave me her hand
how soft it wasl it made me think of a beating heart a birds heart perhaps beating in the palm of the birds captor
and after liu mei came kwan tao with a firm handshake whidi said more than any words he could have irttered beating of my own heart almost suffocated me as i stepped into the iiallway with liu mei
and there was sorrow too that was deeper than the wells of shallaja
i would have given my life for girl
i could understand the grt love defying all prejudice all conventions which must have bound this girls father to her mother
and now both were dead and liu mei dwelt in the house of her aiid bore his name
she put her liand on my arm as we walked to tlte electric elevator liu establislnnent combination office and residence was of five stories and the stairs were almost never used for travel between floors
it suffocated me almost to stand in the tiny elevator with liu mei
surely she must imow and lier eyes told me that she did that she knew she might never mention it
i would never dare
and because i would never dare i blurted out always loved you liu mei
my greatest desire is for your happiness
she was very close to me then and her hand was still on my arm
her perfume was in my nostrils like the radiant ghost of herself that might go with me always
her eyes told me that she had always known
was it fancy or did i see deep down in their depths some hint of love returned
i shook my head in the shock of the near revelation to drive away the image of tlie happiness that might have been ours were it not for the barriers of blood
tliere will never be another liu mei i said
i pressed the button for the first floor and the cage started down
liu mei as we passed tlie fourth floor reached out her hand and turned off the light in the cage
i was alone in the dark with the woman of all women whom i loved and for a moment as the age went creaking down the knowledge hdd me paralyzed
i had looked at my watch from force of habit when we had entered the cage
ten minutes after eleven at night
by eleventhir i would have taken liu mei to safety
then i must bear my own strange cross in patience until she was taken from me her hand had dropped from my arm as though she were afraid of what i might do in my madness and i locked my lips tightly on whatever else desperation might have made me say
the first floor was just below us
i snapped on the light again mustered a smile and turned to lead her forth when the cage stopped
i couldnot believe my eyes
the cage hadnot stopped moving i would have sworn totliat but lfu md was not with me
she had vanished out of a moving elevator as though she had turned to fog and eddied out through the grills into the shaft
nor was that all
five stalwart men in hideous devil masks had taken her place
i stared at them in amazement
it couldnot be yet it was
somewhere along the route from the fifth floor to the first liu mei had vanished and the five had taken her place
and the cage hadnot stopped moving
it had been magic
where is she
i demanded in shrill frightened cantonese
gone said one
and it is an order that the meddling foreigner be punished so that never again will he be tempted to meddle
the speaker pressed the button again and the cage started to ascend
they stopped it between the third and fourth floors
as we went up i snapped a glance at my watch
it said eleventhirty
the cage bearing liu mei and myself had been twenty minutes descending the speaker turned out the light
i must have been paralyzed with fear and surprise for i didnot even offer resistance
in the dark the hands of the devils began upon me
their feet came into use too
they kicked me
they clawed me
they battered away at me
they ripped clothing from me with their knives
finally when it seemed i could stand the agony no longer something heavy struck the top of my head
the cage was filled with shooting stars as the bottom seemed to fall out of it dropping me headlong into the shaft where i struck to find oblivion black as the deepest night
when i regained consciousness i was sprawled outside the elevator on the ground floor
the outer door of course was closed
fog seeped through under it to be absorbed by the lights
i was alone in a building filled with echoes and horror
my hellish assailants were gone
i staggered to my feet
my head was splitting
i ached in every bone and muscle
i vras a sixfooter who should have been able to put up a terrific battle but the five had handled me with ease giving me the most brutal beating any man had ever had to take
the seeming miracle of the twentyminute descent the vanishing of liu mei the appearance of the five did not puzzle me as it might have any one who did not know the potentialities of chinese master mummers as i did
i didnot leave though as the five or those who had sent them must have expected
they did not know my feeling for liu mei which would have sent me into the pit itself
i rang for ffie elevator again
i crawled into it wondering what sort of hell would breathe its brimstone into it this time and went back to the fifth floor
the door to the apartment of liu ti was open
i crossed the threshold my terror mounting
there was nobody here but liu ti and what i might have said to him would never now be said
he was dead
he hung by a silken cord from a beam of his living room
his face was a mask of horror
his bulging eyes stared right at me as though he said by the bond which existed between yovr father and me gordon bais i command you to stand by my niece and her betrothed until the end
tiny shoes carefully and reverently i cut the cord which hung liu ti to the beam and lowered him to the floor
i had closed the outer door
then i now went systematically through all the rooms
not another soul was in the place living or dead
yet he had had a sister here a wife and a brother
now all were gone
and by being my fathers son was a part of this family
i had been spared i knew because i was not chinese
but if i did not refrain from meddling my recent captors had said and had provtti by their manhandling my white blood would not save me from their sinister designs
right now i could have sworn scores of eyes were watching me studying me waiting the family of liu ti was gone
he at least would never know if i went out this very minute into the street and left chinatown never to return
what had i to do with the chinese
maybe in the final analysis i loved that part of liu a mei which was of my own race
maybe i was blinded by my love of oiina where i had spent so many years
maybe wlien my own pecle looked upon love between the races with revclsion they were rht
maybe well if i went away now i was safe
they had safd so
if i sted the beating i had taken would be horribly littfe compared to what y could do to me
but lla father had been white and ray own fathers friend i knew what my dad if he had been iivlog would have done
and knew what my own heart dictated
i stooped over liu ti then aad whirred they wonot get away with it i said while hp couldnot hear me of course or could he
his face didnot diaie expreon but somehow i knew th he knewhhad perhaps known from the begimiang belb the love between mei and me xvas the sort of thft whidi ndgbl devefbp between a boy and girt vdio rear ttether had never been allowed to know what the outside wortd of what it cruelly cafied mfcced love
it was just that nothing more
to me she was a chinese and the sooner i forgot about her the better
but even as these traitorous thoughts went through my brain like black flashes i seemed to see liu mei standing befons me her eyes calm filled with the bnowkdge of the ages as th stared into mine and said tt isnot like you gordon and it wasnot
why should human beings draw back from one another because of race or color or relon
i knew then that nothing ever change me not even when the time came as it would when i would be put to torture for my meddling
without a backward glance i hurried from the room of liu ti and into the hallway i had last traversed with liu mei
somewhere between the fourth ftooi and the first i told myself the strange thing happened i must find which floor ril start with the fourth
for it was there that liu mei afraid of being spied upon had turned out the ligjit
i went down in the devator
it pleased me to defy the enemy tn thfs much at least
i stiped at the fourth floor and got out shutting the door behind me
i was in another hallway brilliantly itghted
i began to move along it my eyes studying every inch of space
i had the feeling that somehow liu mei woidd drop something dial would let me know that would point the way to the place i might find her
but there was i went back to the elevator
i hadnot seen a soul and the echoes of my own footfalls had taken on sinister meaning in the deserted hallway
they seemed to be shouting to me to go bsrck to run fo cease trying to pry into the dark secrets of chinatown
i started to open the elevator door but it would not open
my heart stopped for a moment
since i had left the cage some one had signaled for it and it had or up
viciously i jabbed the button and lieard the whirring of the cage from below
there was something horrible in that whirring
what would i see when i opened the door of the cage
who had signaled it had that one known what i was doing
es watched me now i loiew it
they would watch me as long as i was in qimatown and wherever i went out of qiinatown until the tortuous chinese minds were satisfied that the affair of liu ti and kwan tao and liu mei had been settled accordhig to the rdenttess chinese code
the cage stopped at my floor
i yanked open the door
i donot know what i expected to find certainly not what i did find liu san brother of liu ti standing in a corner of the cage rigidly erect his black eyes staring into mine
there was the haft of a knife sticking out of his left breast
his right hand was clutched about the haft
cold chills raced along my spine
he was dead
he had to be dead with the knife in him like that
but why did he stand upright and why was he in the cage now when it had been empty the last time i had seen it
or had it
the last three words were almost a cry of terror
had he been there with me during my recent descent from the fifth floor to the fourth
if he had i hadnot known it 3ret i knew it was possible
i would have screamed but knew it useless
a hundred murders could have been committed here and none outside the wiser as long as the victims were chinese
a white man disappearing would be sought
i stepped into the cage which quivered a little and touched the body of liu san
instantly it toppled sidewise crashing stiffly to the floor
the corpse was already rigid
had this body been sent to me as a warning
i didnot know but i did know that some one listened many some ones and watched
i shouted knowing that my words went ringing up and down the shaft and out through the grills at all five floors so help me god bring every one responsible for this to justice and slay them with my bare hands if any harm comes to liu mei
of course it was foolish
no sooner had i shouted the echoes ringing all through the empty building than i knew just how foolish it was
on the hallway of the floor above me i could hear the scuffling of sandaled feet
on the floor below i could hear it too
all through the building
i slammed the door dropped down to the next floor
and this time i left the door open so that only by cwning to this floor could any one use the elevator
and be in the hallway where i could see whoever approached
i was fighting mad and more frightened than i had ever been for liu mei mostly i told myself and didnot fool myself at all
i remembered the kiss and caress of chinese knives and knew that i would feel them again
liu mei perhaps was feeling them now i i searched this hallway too and found nothing
then i went back to the elevator
no one had approached it for repeatedly i had looked back to make sure
i started to step into the cage
the body of liu san had vanished
in its place reposed the dead body of liu sister around her neck the mate of the cord which had strangled liu ti the elevator had become an instrument of hellish black magic
two people had been slain in it within the last fifteen minutes or slain elsewhere and dumped into it for me to find by some means i couldnot even guess at
i was like an automaton geared to run a certain distance in a straight line
i couldnot wouldnot turn back or change my course in one iota come hell or high water
i dropped down to the second floor still seeking the trail of liu mei
this had to be the last floor for i had come to on the first floor to find liu mei missing
i stepped fearfully over the supine body of liu sister into the hallway
and almost at once like eyes of cats blinking in the dark i saw the shoe
it was a tiny shoe and i recognized it at once
one of liu set with the brilliants that peeped forth so alluringly from under the hem of her gown when she walked
it seemed to call to me beseechingly
it seemed to plead
a it seemed to threaten to challenge me
it took all of my courage to walk down the hallway to that single shoe to stare down at it
it rested on its side at the top of a flight of stairs
it was liu shoe without a doubt
she had kicked it off for me to find or had she
maybe her captors had left it there to lead me to destruction
what would happen to me if i picked it up and went with it down the stairs
those stairs strangely were ominously black filled with ebon foreboding of disaster to come
the whole building seemed to have fallen silent to listen to what
to the beating of my own terrified heart
i wouldnot take the black stairs
they led down to the first floor take the elevator stubbornly as i had taken it hitherto
this time i expected to find that some other horror had developed in my absence
but no
the door of the cage was still open and the sister of liu ti still sprawled supine on the floor
i started to shut the door when the cry came shrill piercing filled with agony and with terror
gordon
gordon bais the cry came from the depth of that black stairwell whence steps led down into god knew what
that it had been the voice of liu mei i knew for a certainty as i raced for the stairs
and scarcely had the echoes of my footfalls started in the liallway again than it came once more with something added gordon i go back go back fol and there it broke short off and i knew that a hand had closed tightly over her mouth z dirty hand a grimy chinese hand like the hands which had beaten me smelly hands hands which it were sacrile to use upon the person of liu md
if i could get my hands on the fellow who had stopped her even for touching her i would tear his heart out with steely finr gers
i didnot realize she had warned me back until i had plunged headlong into the black stairwell to be swallowed by a darkness redolent with the odor of incense and liu perfume
i saw her then vanishing into the hallway on the first floor around the comer of the stairwell below carried backward upright in the big arms of two huge men whose faces i could not see but which i knew were devilmasked
something struck me at the base of the skull and i rolled down the rest of the stairs numb from the blow but knowing as i rolled that my attacker was right behind coming to strike me in
i hit the bottom and fought for the strength to meet him when he reached me
where is uu mei body as i dragged stubbomly to my feet seemed to be made of lead
my arms were burdens my legs were almost too heavy to drag under me
my neck was stiff almost immovable as i twisted it by great effort of will to face the man who came down tlie stairs behind me
a chinese of course and a huge one wearing a devils mask
i couldnot have handled him man for man had i been in full possession of my faculties and he unarmed
as matters stood i was on my feet but out helpless and he carried a club in both hands
he wore the queue most unusual in a modern chinese and it looked like a snake above his mask
his teeth were showing in a snarl or a grimace of murderous amusement
he was like something out of a nightmare
i raised my hands or tried to to ward off the blow he was sending at my but my tends wouldnot move and the blow landed
it landed with a dull sound as though he had struck the head of a drum and i scarcely felt it at all
that one thing told me how close i was to death
he had brought the chib down whh both hands
i had tried to pull my head out of the way
i think the blow was a glancing one
it must have been else it would have driven my head down into my shoulders
he came at me striking again
my right shoulder well i think it was almost broken by that first blow
i had no defense whatever except my wits
and a certain knowledge of cantonese
now i used the latter knowledge and heard singsong words burble madly through my lips lips that felt diick as untanned leather figure of the chinese danced before my eyes until there seemed to te two of him as i oke the words must get to liu mei
she has done nothing
what w31 they do to her his answer was so strange that for a long moment i did not understand him
you know the ancient cantonese custom of the broken urn
um
i repeated
what has liu mei to do with urns
this he answered falling back a little because i had managed to lift my left foot against him to keep him from getting too close
that a chinese husband expects his wife ft come to him as forgners call it idean
if he finds it is not so he ends her back to her fafter on a rattling cart a broken urn swinging below a broken urn surrounded by bits of metal that dink the it drove most of the numbness out of me then and there
i loved the chinese always had the bad whh the good but had never been able to thifdc of thdr heartlessness to women without a shudder of revulsion
but lilt hei can not thus be sent back
again that horrible rattling in my throat which i could scarcely reccize as my own voice speaking cantonese
there is no finer more suitable woman anywhere
that is true he said at the moment
but when we have finished whh her he left it there and i knew the full meaning of his horrible fangshowing grimace
uu mei was to be given to these monsters
she was being taken away to that fate even as we spoke
kwan tao being a chinese could no more have taken her to wife than he could have denied his belief in gods and devils on the rivers of his native land
it wasnot the first time a fragile delicate chinese woman had been given to a mob
and here was numb with hurt unable to stop this imspealable and liu mei already gone
nothing had happened to her so far only because her captors must first make sure of me
they had no desire for foreign police to break in ou them
i cried out in agony
i was a desperate savage man at that moment who couldnot be hurt any more
whether i loved liu mei or not have gone to help her because she was a woman and lier captors bloodmad brutes
my desperation lent power to my bands my feet
i lunged at my attacker with my head down like a footbfdl player smashing the line
again his club crashed down on me
this time i took most of the trific blow m my shoulderbbdes but almost intolerable pain shot through my entire body then my head crashed into the mans stomach
he was tdcen by surprise by a form of attack new to him and went violently backward to the floor striking his head with a sickening thud
the club rolled from his hands
i saw it and resolved tliat whatever happened to liu mei none of it wotdd be because of this man at my feet
a i picked up the dub
i remembered the blows which had crashed against my skull
i must have been mad a beast in my own right
with all my power i smashed the club down on his head just as he lifted it from the floor
as it struck the top of his skull i felt the club sink in or the wood give and his head dropped back soddenly upon the floor
something red and sinuous like a crimson snake crept out from his mask sluggislily crawling
still with the dub in my hand i whirled and ran sluggishly along the way those two had gone with liu mei i scarcely realized that the blood from my own wounds was streaming down my cheeks until i tasted its salt on my lips
another flight of stairs led down into darkness
i didnot hesitate down those stairs and from that moment on what happened was a kind of blur
there were masked men on the stairs and i struck at them savagely with all my power
i felt the club crack against skulls cheeks against bodies
i rammed the end of it into bellies but i allowed none of this to stay my headlong plunge down those stairs
it was dark that basement where i struck the bottom of the stairs but far ahead of me i saw a faint glow of light and i knew that i was somewhere in the labyrinth under chinatown that maze of tunnels and passageways which no white man ever sees
there were men behind me but they feared my bloody swinging club
besides i was mouthing weird cries which sounded insane even to me and chinese have dread respect for the insane
knowing this the inspiration came to pretend insanity to keep it up until the last
if theyd realize that insane or not aiming directly at the freeing of liu mei they would know i was not mad but if i acted fast enough they wouldnot have time to think
i came to that glow of fight it was a tunnel mouth and in the tunnel i dashed to the first turnii
even here i could see that it led to another basement and a vast room outfitted with gaudy lavishness
the room was filled with coolies scores of them standing facing their master with becoming servility masked heads bowed
there was one man on a dais a man in gorgeous robes with a black cap on his head topped by a red coral button
he wore the fivestrand beard of venerable wisdom and there was no smile on his lips nor mask upon his face
bound gagged fastened to a column which upheld the roof stood kwan tao
he was struggling with hie bonds
his eyes were shooting flames
i stared at him as i ran
he was naked to the waist and his torso was a mass of blood
kwan tao had been beaten with the bamboo until his skin and flesh had been shredded
his chest was crimson and dripping and horrible
it made me think of the ghastly death of a thousand cuts but i know kwan tao wasnot thinking of those wounds those ghastly wounds which would have killed a white man
standing between two coolies before the man on the dais was liu mei
her face was deadly white but she stood proudly erect like a soldier
i saw the lips of the man on the dais and they were moving but what the man said i couldnot make out
yet i was close enough to have heard
i saw the lips of liu mei move in answer
i saw her head thrown back as though she flung defiance into the face of the seated man
his face was twisted into bestial lines as he listened
but why couldnot i hear what was being said had something happened to my senses as ihe result of the beatings i had taken the whole thing was utterly weird
it was tiice watching a silent motion picture and hearing not even the machine which ran it
yet all of these people were alive unless i were looking into a vart mirror which seemed impossible
the man on the dais suddenly rose shot out his hand and slapped liu mei twice once on either side of the face so hard that i thought her head would be knodd from her shouidets i knew that e for i could see her moutii open but i teard no sound
the chinese master stood there in his wrath and i knew that he heaped that wrath upon this woman who defied win
her uncle his sister mid god knew who rfse had already paid the penalty for something
i had seen two a sister and a brother of liu ti and knew some of the answer
when any chinese tribunal sentenced a man to death his whole family dial with him for what good did it do destroy the tiger mid spare die cute
only kwaa tao they had spared for the moment at least kit in the end lie would go the same way
just now tliougli they wished hhn to know to the full the huntihation to be visited upon liu mei the mt terrible feeling as i hurled ojyseif toward this ghastly tableau that i was a man in a nightmare with i loved in dangw and my own feet rooted to the ground so that i could not move while death raixd upon me from the rear
it was like swimming in glue forward march because of my weakness
my feet drammed against the tunnel floor but seemed to talce me forward not at all
my club was altnost too heavy to hold
i had to clutch it with all the strength of my two hands
i wondered if lm mei didnot know i was here trying my best to get to her if only that i might ay her myself to save her from what the monsters would do to her
did she guess
as tiiough in answer to my thought she turned and looked dired1y at me
i thought her right hand lifted palm toward me as though she would order me to get back to save myself
but she couldnot possibly liave seen me
i knew that instantly and yet in some strange fashion she must have known i was there trying my best to reach her
i whirled
there where hideously masked faces all around me
qiinese blocking my retreat had i wished to retreat they didnot offer to touch me again
they merely laughed horrible cackling laughter which shodc their bodies witli their glee and they were laughing at me
i whirled burled myself forward again
i struck something an invisible mysterious something in fidl stride and it knocked mo flat on my back stunning me again
i almost lost my and all around me they laughed and chattered
i scrambled to my feet felt in the air for whatever it was that had knocked me down
my hands came in terrifying with an expanse of spotlessly clean glass of such dimensions that it sliut me in the tunnel entirely yet let me see the hwror of tbe room bond tilings were made plain to me in that one agonizing moment
i knew or guessed sometiiing of what must have happened
coming down in the elevator liu mei and i had passed a floor just after some sort of drug hidden in the odor of meense perhaps had a been blown through the grill
it had instantly rendered both of iis inanimate
the cage had automatically stopped at the ground floor where i had been taken out
then the enemy on the other floor had pressed the signal and the cage had gone back up bearing liu mei helpless unconscious of what was happening to her into the hands of her enemies
i had awakened in the cage again and had been beaten horribly because i was too numb and stupid from the drug to fight back
why had the chinese gone about their work in so elaborate a fashion when a single knife thrust would have done for me and left liu mei in their hands
there seemed at the moment just one explanation the one i had given myself
they played with me to keep me from going out and bringing the white police
and they didnot kill me solely because they know for sure that i hadnot told police to come looking for me if i didnot reappear in a certain length of time
and this glass in the tunnel shutting me off from the room beyond
i could imagine why it was there
not for my personal and special confounding but so that enemies of this imholy group or people who doubted its power might see what the monsters were capable of doing
i couldnot go forward
the tunnel behind me was packed with chinese
knowledge of my plight drove me mad
in a few moments something terrible would happen to liu mei
i had to reach her
i think desperation must have given me the strength of many men
i stepped back from that expanse of glass
i felt my biceps bulge
power unimaginable power seemed to swell and distend my every nerve and muscle
the world whirled
the tunnel spun
i hurled myself at that glass
i didnot feel my hurts
it was as though my anger had nullified my agony
sweat dripped from me the salty sweat of a cornered brute beast
my chib crashed against that glass with all the power i had
as it did every face and every mask in the room beyond was turned toward me
liu mei turned and her hand went to her mouth
her eyes were big with terror
a great jagged star showed in the glass
i felt someone hurl himself at me from behind
i spun swung instinctively lifted my aim a little and crashed my stick in the mans mouth
it must have knocked out every tooth his head
he turned a back somersault into the press behind him
but i didnot even wait to see him strike among his fellows
i whirled back to the glass again seizing the split seconds left before the enemy behind overpowered me
the first crash of my bludgeon against the glass had sounded like the crack of doom
the second was even worse for slivers of glass broke free and clattered into the tunnel in jagged shards while others fell in the rown beyond
berserk now unstoppable desperate with terror i swung and swung again
i smashed through
the opening was small but i stepped back and hurled myself through it just the same
jagged points like a thousand swords struck me caught at my clothing ripped my flesh i was sobbing and cursing
i would reach liu mei
i would free kwan tao to my knees beyond the glass turning a little to see the smaller chinese coming through the glass after me
i paused just a moment to crack down on the skulls of the first two
i did not spare my strength and there were other spfaffers of crimson on the glass when i again swung back to the occupimts of that hateful room
my enemies in the tunnel aghast that one man could be so murderously destructive and drawn back
i could hear the voices of die men in the room i had so violently and madly entered
the man on the dais sdze the rl take her to the room beyond
half the coolie with her the other half here to slay this meddler f the coolies divided as though they had alreaffy been instructed
kwan tao a bleeding iwrror tugged witliout cessation at his fionds
the man on the dais scarcely moved nor did the expression on his face change jumped between the girl and me
through their ranks i saw the others bearing the girt to the other room
i had no trouble gusing what woufd happen there
but no damned coolies could keep me from reaching her
i swung into that first group with all njy desperate ftrry
one went down with a smashed tll
i heard the man on the dais the first man to break ground before i bid him dies by my hand
i snapped a glance over my right shoulder
the man on the dais gripped a snubnosed automatic in his rit hand
anotlier chinese vtut down
desperation drove the other coolies as they stood shoulder to shoulder to fight me off
there were more aming through the glass behind me i knew
but i didnot take time to turn
i swept die heavy end of that club along the faces of my enemies not to land solidly but to graze ant maim and smash
the effect was horrible the now bloody masks askew
it was like running the end of a stick along a picket fence save that tire result was bloody horror
and i cried out all the tfme
i saw the door beyond them open
liu mei cast one despairing look over her shoulder at me as the coolies bore her into that room out of which a faint light came
then she was gone and die smiridng coolies with her and hell had never spawned a fury such as i became
i swung again and missed completely
and this was the reason
the man on the dais had said enough
let him try to reach irer now
you are too iate gordon bais
by the time you could rip down tliat door he have to finish it
i hurled myself toward the door but my mind was not on tliat objective
it held a picture of the automatic gripped on the knee of the master of all this horror
i couldnot reach him
bullets woirid travel too fast
his eyes would be following every move i now made
i had his location fast fixed in my mind
i must make no slightest error of judgment
and i did not
almost at the door i whirled like a dervish and the bluntended club sped from my hands with my power and with all the skill that sometimes comes to a man in a desperate place
it went like a shot directly for the chest of the man on the dais
his opened to scream
but the sound never got out
his right hand italf swung toward me but he didnot have time to pull the trigger
the bhint dub struck him in the dhest and bones and cartdage must have given back before the hurtling projectile
the man toppled badeward from his dais
i was right behind my strange weapon of offense while the slow thinkers almost incapable of executing anytititig without the command of some superior stared at me like so many yellow statues
only their es moved
i grasped the unconscious tealer by the throat yanked him to fiis feet
a i shook him
i had to bring him to
i grabbed at his automatic held it in my right hand so that its muazle menaced the wall of coolies who now surrounded me
make one move against me i said hoarsely and twist this mans head from his shoulders
they knew i meant it and this man was their rice their living their master
no move was made by any one
the man was coming around
where is the key to that room
i demanded
if i donot get it still kill this monster
nobody spoke
the unconscious man couldnot
kwan tao still with his bonds
i snapped at the nearest coolie in whose belt was a knife
loose his gag
cut his bonds had ever obeyed a mas ter more quickly
kwan tao stepped free
his face his whole body had been so harshly tortured that it was next to impossible to recognize him
where is the key kwan tao
i demanded
on his left wrist hidden under the sleeve
i found it fastened by a thong
i yanked it free breaking the thong but only after it had cut deeply into the mans flesh
i dragged him to the door
i commanded kwan tao to hold him there
if anything has happened to her i said this man will wish to god he had never been born
kwan tao didnot answer me
he merely stared
his lips worked spasmodically
his face was a gargoylesque red mask
take this gat i snapped again and see that the coolies donot follow us into the room
i twisted the key in the lock
the door protestingly
from inside it driving me to madness came sounds which were like a womans moans of terror
then words in shrill cantonese in liu voice turtles sons of turtles eggs of turtles how dare you lay hands on a daughter of kings
and one voice making answer daughter of kings true but damned to eternity by mingling with the blood of a barbarian
even your ancestors would say that what befalls you will be less than you deserve
then i was inside with kwan tao beside me dragging the man i had all but slain
and what a tableau met my eyes
liu mei backed against a far wall much of her upper garments tom away
her head was back her shoulders were stiff with pride
her right hand held a knife poised its point aimed at her own heart
the masked coolies were closing on her in a tight semicircle like hyenas to the kill
drop it liu mei snapped some one
out you curs back with your own the crimson kwan tao was the spokesman
liu mei dropped the knife
the chinese slunk past us like beaten mongrels
kwan tao while relief began to surge through me shut the door locked it put his back against ft
kwan tao grinned a savage red grin
the man he had dragged in with him had vanished
maybe he had been playing dead
maybe well the fact remained that between the second kwan tao shoved him against the wall and closed the door the man had snapped into consciousness and had slipped out behind kwan tao
kwan tao hadnot closed the door
it had been closed from outside and all three of us were prisoners
we bimgled it said kwan tao but maybe it is just as well
he stared at liu as i did
hef face never be whiter
she had plainly been through hell i wanted to ask her what had happened
chinese are to us brutally frank
kwan tao asked her before i could those coolies did they have coolies ever in all our history asked liu mei bitterly failed to take of women captives
she didnot mince words
i saw the fece of kwan tao change as no torture had ever been able to make it change
no chinese of his station cotdd possibly ignore the law of the broken nfn
i broke in on tlie grim thing that had come between kwan tao and the woman both of us loved
will some one kindly tell me the meaning of all this will said kwan tao and i must hurry for we have little time
little time
i repeated
yes for even now the snaky tendrils of the yellow smoke comes into this from the room of hell beyond
the flowery language of the highbom chinese did not desert him even now i whirled and saw the yellow snioke yellow tentacles of it coming in through the keyhole making one think of an inept smoker trying to blow rings
i choked
it already had me by the throat
chineje blank watb said kwan tao speaking very rapidly wished me to take liu mei in marriage
i wished it too proud to have for wife the dauter of chinese kings
but the tong said no
lhi ti the tong
they thrtened us with death i liu ti persisted in his defiance
liu ti thought you might help
this is the result
and now my two good friends here we are altogether with but a few minutes of life left to us
he didnot go toward liu mei
i knew that centuries of tradition held him apart from her
modern america would have ridden in its youth over any such barrier as convention had reared between these two especially when the fault was not with liu mei
kwan tao spoke to her loved you from the bottom of my heart liu ti know
her voice was harsh
but if we were to escape from this pit you would never again so much as touch my hand
he didnot nod he couldnot
he didnot shake his head
there was no answer he could give because liu mei had already given it love you too liu mei have always loved you i said
one might as well speak truly on the brink of the grave where there was nothing to win or lose loved rou both said liu mei speaking as one already dead
and now i die alone
it is so unutterably lonely
i didnot tell them even if there had been time what had befallen their people
they must have guessed anythow
they knew their own kind
i whirled on kwan tao
go to her tao i choked
take her in your arms
what can it matter now when death is so close
he looked at her and did not move
in the ear of my mind i could hear a creaky cart on the streets of canton with a tinkling broken urn swinging below it
i could see liu mei white o face sitting on that cart jeered at by multitudes along the narrow muddy streets
the thought almost broke my heart
i started toward liu mei and couldnot make it
my feet didnot work properly
a i staggered almost falling away over to the right
the wall was jumping at me
i couldnot lift my arms to ward it off
it struck me in the face knocking me flat
i rolled to my side looked at kwan tao
he was staring his face a mask of agony at liu mei
but he hadnot taken a step toward her
now he swayed like a tree in a hurricane as the drug which was slaying all three of us got in its deadly work
i got to my feet finally and it was like lifting a mighty weight
i slid against the wall trying to shove myself toward liu mei
she was watching me and her eyes thanked me
it must liave hew terrible to a delicately nurtured woman to die uke this with two men who knew what a dreadful thing bad happened to her fina reached her
i put n arm around it
it was like tryir to lift an arm of lead
i sagged against hie wall
a yellow film now between kwan tao and me through which he seemed still to sway
his eyes were still fixed on liu mei
i thought he was talking but there was a ringing in my ears so that i was none too sure
daughter of kings
blood of kings
i tliougbt he was saying
defiled by dregs from die rbttenest gutters of chinatown
how can turned to liu lei
it wouldnot matter to me darling i whispered my whisper a sobbing kind of gasp know you help it
i would tjdce you in my arms hold you forever and wed both forget
she whispesed back
how good it is to know that gordon bais on the brink of the eastern heaven
shb like kwan tko used the flowery speech in a crisis
she was all chinese save that her coloring was almost as light as my own
she to me was an american girl
i tried to hold her more tightly
but both of us were swaying and i was trying to grip the smooth cold wall with the fingernails of my free liand
i felt the nails slide along the stone i heard them like a thin screaming in my ears
these weird impressions told me that hashish at least in part was in the yellow smoke which destroyed us
there was nothing ahead of us but death
i turned to face liu mei
maybe by slapping her by shaking her head i could keep her awake
soon the enemy would open the door
then perhaps i could hurl her out save her
but god help me i couldnot manage my hands and arms
all my strength could not lift them
i couldnot even take my arm from about the proud graceful shoulders of liu mei were all three doomed
this was the end
i swayed
we swayed together and i tiunk liu mei held me up once or twice when i would have fallen
my eyes seemed to bulge as i looked at that locked door so that the thin tendrils of yrilow smoke became as large fullbodied pythons yellow hideous nightmare pythons shoving their coifs through a gargantuan keyhole to quest for the three of us
i tiled again to tell liu mei that it didnot matter
but now no words would pass my lips
my vocal cords would no longer serve me unaccountably i was down on the floor on my belly i couldnot rise again
i couldnot wriggle my fingers
beside me liu mei was standing with her feet wide apart proudly trying to die erect
the yellow film was everywhere
kwan tao still stood weaving swaying looking at liu mei
she must have been looking at him too
but she preferred me i was sure of that
it was something to take with me into the hereafter where our heavens would not cross and we should never meet again
unless the white of liu mei came to my heaven
how silly it was but the yellow smoke caused it
and then my heart seemed to stop beating for a moment
i was losing liu mei
perhaps i had never had her
her love yes a strange kind of love but part of my life
now the two of them kwan tao and liu mei staggering almost falling were moving toward each other
i saw them meet
his hands by some superhuman power which i did not share because i could not move mine at all went out to her
they caught her left arm drew the hand through his elbow
they stood side by side with this strange chinese handclasp which was the signal of foregiveness of dose harmony of souls
and then though both knew american kisses because both had known the freedom of american schools they were both all china
they were rubbing their cheeks together because the true chinese did not kiss
they locked in each others arms
then they fell as a tree falls and though i saw them strike the hard floor i did not hear them because of the ghastly roaring in my ears
they fell sprawled supine but held fast in each others arms and my spirit writhed in agony as they fell
for i knew that in those last minutes both had forgotten there had ever been such a one as gordon bais took that awful strange agony with me into abysmal darkness where there was nothing but the roaring in my ears
darkness through which shot long tendrils of yellow smoke engulfed me consciousness in an elevator that was moving
strange and horrible and unearthly it seemed
my last memory liad been of kwan tao and liu mei falling side by side in the room of the yellow smoke forgetting all about me
and here i was in a moving elevator
my hand was on the control
the cage was dropping
save that liu mei was not here i might just have entered it with her
but what hell there had been between my dazed drugged wits began to come back
i noted the passing floors
i was dropping from the third to the second
i jammed the control to stop the car at the ground floor
i ran out
i was crazy i suppose but it couldnot end like this
i had to find kwan tao and liu mei
i screamed
i went racing through the corridor down the stairs heading for the tunnel where miu lei kwan tao and i had suffered
i smashed headon against a wall where the door leading down had been
there was nothing
just a smooth wall with no sign that a stairway had ever existed here
i banged against that panel shouting
i couldnot have broken it down with a battering ram
the echoes of my cries and my pounding ran eerily all through the bouse
that was all
no other soiwids
wild with terror i raced back to the elevator
half an hour later i had scoured that building from top to bottom and had found not fwie living soul
nor a dead body
and this at the last was the result of my madness i had found no trace of liu mei or kwan tao no hint that liu uncle a had ever even lived here
every trace of the things which had happened here had vanished
i found nothing
i satisfied mysetf that i was alone in this place that had become a mausoleum of dreadful mystery
i battered against that mystery and could find no answer
i tried to find ways down into the warrens and only cold blank panels met my every attempt i was beatwi whipped get officers dashed to the outer door the only one in this place that wasnot locked
i raced out looking along the street for police
the door clicked shut and locked behind me
i couldnot get back in
i banged against that door i broke my knnddes
i cried out liu name and kwan i sobbed with futile rage and despair
this was i knew the end
nobody hi all chinatown throughout which my cries and battering must have been plaily heard gave the slightest sign until almost an hoftr of madness had passed
then an old a very old chinese gentleman came to me looked up and said it is futile for the foreigner to batter his head against the stones
the dead must bury their dead
the past is gone
nothing can be regained
the task of the kving is to forget quickly
in your place my young friend i should go back to my own
for never again will you see any of you knew so well no not even though your police tear chinatown into shreds
it took a long time to convince me but he did it finally and i went home staggering like a drunken man while fingers of yellow mist seemed eternally to be striking the lobes of my brain pushing them ainst the inside of my skull
out of it all i thought crazily the yellow smoke at least would be always with me ns 10c a copy out now wmamsr stobses ever toldi two fall heagib novel of eerio mrsterf itm by now on sale
by two weirdly realistic novelettes by by and three unforgettable short terror tales had nsen from puddler to the control cab of the big ladle in less than three years
a hard worker joe seitz was and the hearth foreman had had his eye on him from the first
before the first year was out he had seen that joe was put in charge of furnace no and the only reason joe hadnot risen steadily from that time onward was due to no fault of it just happened that at the time there was no job open to there was a pause in the puddler bosss upward progress that lasted almost two years
that two years strained joe patience to the limit and beyond
but seitz had never workw anywhere but in the steel mills
he didnot know anything else
he had to stick but there was nothing to keep him from advancing up and away from the furnaces
nothing that is except the fact that ben grady had the job he was in line for and in two years time ben never gave a sign of slipping never made a mistake never missed a days work
it was maddening
joe seitz went on a three weeks drunk to see if he couldnot think of something to do about it
his brain was sligish and dull when he was sober
only his motorsensory system worked efficiently seemingly without the stimulant of alcohol
but liquor loosened his imagination gave him ideas
he emerged from the drunk with a fullyhatched scheme for removing ben grady from his path
once in a while the big ladle got stuck right in the middle of the mill
it always happened when there was a full load in it the weight of the molten metal in the huge cauldron making the accident more promote joe into likely to occur
there was a slight dent on the girder the conveyor traveled on and the bump sometimes sprung a dog in the cutoff mechanism so that the circuit to tlie motor was broken
when tluit happened the man in tlie control cab had to walk out on tlie girder until he was directly over the huge vat of boiling metal in order to reset the cutoff dog
the mill did not have a night shift
business was dull and seitz had no difficulty in avoiding the nightwatchman when he came to put his jan into operation
the plan was very simple
all seitz did was to crawl out on the girder and grease it thoroughly at the spot that would be directly over the ladle the next time the dog slipped
it did
ben grady died horribly and joe got his job
ben had screamed when his foot slipped on the grease seitz had put on the girder
he had screamed again as his body plunged down through space into the ladle of whitehot molten metal
joe seitz remembered those screams
he was afraid that he would remember and at intervals seem to hear them in all their braintwisting horribleness until he died
lately it had been getting time the iadle the nhfldle ai dw aaiy lapffiiite the wliae die cah wa located joe seitz he coiid look dowtt iitto the rat from where he perched aad in ian he saw his body into that lashir fury of ea soup
he tried to himself that it was a mercifid death
that didnot help ai
wfaawver the ladle reached the wlre it used to get uck joe could hear grady scream
the ladle didnot get sftick any fnore death had rulted hi the repair of tiiat dent in the gicder
sonjething like that usually had to hzjpen in bore a piece of maclimery was fixed
but joe continued to hear ben scream the screams got louder eveay day
bmally it got to the point where joe decided he couldnot stand it any niorc this jei that be had waited ee yea cor that he had worked himself bl the face for that he had even commhted murder ior had turned aour on hm he realized ttiat his nerves were breaking uncter the strain dl waiting to hear ben scream a half dozen tini a day
all hk seiwjry whole brain seemed to he centered iti ins ears every dme the ladle came by with its load
he would at there tense tudvering waiting for the ladle to readi diat middle point
then he woidd hear aie screams set a date for hinisdl he decided to quit in two wedks
hiose two weeks were hell but lie stuck it out
th last day he alitioa changed his mind
toe first fall ladle went by and he heard ncrthmg
the second started up from the hearths and he mt nodiing
his nerves remain relaxed
he was as calm and unperturbed as he ever was in his life
the sewad reached the and went on by
joe heard not it was the same wfth the third
at lunch time joe was more cheerful than he had ban in moo
he laubed joked with ws idlovrwwkers with a freedbm and spirit f carnsnaderie that made them lo at mna speculatwdy
tb wondered if lie was dnmk
as fer joe he was g3ad that ijb had not given the foreman notioe
