THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

S OME issues back — in January, 
to be exact — this space mused 
on the satisfactions derived from 
reading about the adventures of 
John Jakes’ Brak the Barbarian. 
Yet a reader whose letter we 
quoted demurred, saying: “Brak 
is no barbarian. What is he?” 
Shortly thereafter, author Jakes 
arose to defend his hero, and the 
following (“My first and last 
word on the subject, I swear”) 
is from Brak’s creator : 

“It is considered unseemly for 
writers to write letters of argu- 
ment about their creations. But 
I can’t resist. There is indeed a 
Grail-like quality about Khurdi- 
san. But I know, incidentally, 
what will happen to B. when the 
time comes, soon or late, for him 
to play out his last adventure. I 
know now whether he will or 
whether he won’t reach Khurdi- 
san. It will be unravelled the last 
time he ever sees print, in a piece 
which I think will be called The 
Battle For the World. 

What is Brak? Well, he is re- 
ferred to, by me, as ‘the barbar- 
ian,’ which he is, by an accident 
of birth and upbringing. As I 
get to know him, though, I dis- 
cover he has learned a great deal 
on his own peculiar sort of Grand 
Tour. 

And I would only point out 
that it is B. — who has a bit of 
courage, some simple honor — who 
is always being addressed as 
“barbarian” or “outlander” by 



the villains. There really is no 
doubting that B. is hopelessly 
old-fashioned in many ways, and 
not at home in a world of worldly, 
affluent princes who are adepts 
at all sorts of human unkindness, 
and think nothing of calling on 
a few monsters in order to get 
One Up on their neighbors. 

I like him, anyway. And there 
is nothing so pleasant as learn- 
ing that a given reader is, at 
least, not indifferent to him.”

He could never erase from his memory the evil 
face of the child of horror , . . the loathsome 
thing that waited in , 



By ARTHUR PENDRAGAN 


W HAT dark secret had driven 
Laurence Cullum to the edge 
of nervous hysteria ? What unut- 
terable obligation had forced him 
to cry out for succor like an ago- 
nized madman? These and other 
questions relevant to the desper- 
ate condition of the master of 
Cullum House perplexed Doctor 
Nathan Buttrick as he clucked 
his team homeward through 
Penaubsket Bridge on the fringe 
of Sabbathday in northern New 
England. In other circumstances 
he might have been dozing, lulled 
by the cries of the nighthawks 
aloft and the peace of an upland 
twilight. But now, although his 
body craved sleep, his mind was 
vitally awake. 

Doctor Buttrick was baffled by 
the peculiar malady which made 
each day a living horror for Cul- 
lum. All the sedatives of the 1924 


pharmacoepia had failed to quell 
the anxiety which gnawed at the 
mind of his patient. In his frus- 
tration at the failure of the tab- 
lets and injections, the physician 
had even resorted to folk reme- 
dies whispered by black-gummed 
grandmothers in the hills back 
from the sea. Infusions of tea 
and henbane, petals of amaryllis 
held under the tongue — he had 
tried all the high-country nos- 
trums which once he held in pro- 
fessional scorn. They were as fu- 
tile in calming Cullum as the 
most advanced drugs the age 
could offer. 

As the feeble lights of Sab- 
bathday came into view around 
the granite mass of Gallowglass 
Hill, Buttrick reviewed once 
again the particulars of the case. 
Laurence Cullum, age 47. Af- 
flicted with a cerebral aneurism. 


7 


a soft patch in a brain artery 
which might burst tomorrow, in 
five years, or never. He was the 
last of the Cullum line, a promi- 
nent family begun by Draper 
Cullum, the leader of the 1706 ex- 
pedition which struck northward 
from Dunstable to find, on an 
August Sunday, the protected 
harbor on the North Atlantic 
around which would grow the 
seacoast town of Sabbathday. 

The Cullums had always been 
influential in the town, yet oddly 
retiring. Laurence was the most 
hermitic of the lot. Since the 
death of his sister Emma and the 
diagnosis of his aneurism, he 
had shut himself up in the gray 
New England Gothic mansion at 
the end of Windham Road. His 
controlling hand was still felt on 
many of the town’s business af- 
fairs, but this was merely the 
ghost of the man. His physical 
presence was sequestered behind 
the grotesque archway of Cullum 
House — tw'o enormous jawbones 
of a sperm whale, erected during 
the tenancy of the last patriarch, 
Captain Hugh. 

These facts and the few pleas- 
antries that Buttrick had ex- 
changed with Cullum during the 
man’s infrequent visits to town 
were all that the doctor knew of 
the Cullum heir before treat- 
ments for the aneurism began. 
Except for the grim scene on the 
night of Emma’s death two years 
before. The physician had been 


in attendance, accompanied by 
Cullum and most of the house- 
hold staff. Buttrick would never 
forget the last words of Emma, 
spoken as she clutched her broth- 
ers arm in a white-knuckled 
hand. 

“Laurence, you will keep — the 
guardianship ?’’ 

“I — I shall, my dear,” Cullum 
replied as a mad, trapped look ap- 
peared in his eyes. Then the life 
of the frail spinster eked out its 
last heartbeat, and Buttrick’s 
usefulness had ended. 

'■PHE doctor heard nothing of 
A Laurence Cullum for a year 
and a half after his sister’s de- 
mise. Then came the midnight 
telephone call. Buttrick rolled 
groggily from his bed, expecting 
a summons to the side of any one 
of three wives who were await- 
ing childbirth. Instead, he was 
shocked into full awareness by 
an almost hysterical voice beg- 
ging him to administer relief. 
Although years of medical prac- 
tice had somew'hat jaded his sen- 
sibility to human pain, Buttrick 
heard a voice so filled with a 
frantic tension that the listener 
himself became afraid in an un- 
conscious resonance with the 
pleading tones. He whipped his 
team across the surly Penaub- 
sket River and along Windham 
Road, guided only by the chill 
light of a three-quarter moon. At 
the end of the headlong ride he 


8 


found Cullum in a state of ex- 
treme anxiety within the mould- 
ering drawing room of the 
mansion. The earpiece of the 
telephone was still off its hook as 
the man cowered in a great wing 
chair, whimpering like an in- 
jured child in shocking contrast 
to the manliness of his six-foot 
frame. Although he was wrapped 
in a dressing gown, Cullum’s 
trouser cuffs bore traces of dry- 
ing mud. 

Buttrick quickly administered 
the standard dosage of a seda- 
tive. It had no effect. A second 
injection calmed Cullum, or rath- 
er removed the physical mani- 
festations of his hysteria. But 
even as the drug subdued his 
trembling, Cullum retained a 
spark of horror in his eyes. 

Repeatedly Buttrick ques- 
tioned the sufferer about the 
cause of his alarming discompo- 
sure. And each time the gaunt- 
faced Cullum had burrowed deep- 
er into the plush of the wing 
chair, mumbling under the seda- 
tion, “Can’t say — mustn’t say. 
No one must ever know. The 
guardianship!” Despite himself 
the physician felt a growing fear 
at the recurrence of that ominous 
term first uttered in his hearing 
by the dying lips of Emma Cul- 
um. 

At last the opiate calmed the 
man’s chaotic nerves. With the 
aid of Amadee, an aged Acadian 
man-servant, the doctor wrestled 


the drugged weight onto a settee 
near the fire. He left a vial of 
tablets with the servant, and the 
assurance that he would visit his 
master on the next day. Then 
Buttrick returned to town ex- 
hausted physically but unable to 
quell the incessant questioning 
of his curiosity. What event or 
obsession could explain the men- 
tal disintegration of Cullum? 
What arcane significance had 
that curious term muttered by 
Laurence even in his narcotic 
stupor ? 

During the months of treat- 
ment which followed the first 
nighttime summons, the doctor 
had learned little else about the 
trouble at Cullum House. He had 
diagnosed the aneurism, but was 
certain that his patient’s ex- 
treme nervousness and loss of 
weight were by no means related 
to his physical affliction. Rather 
there was some obligation, bur- 
den, perhaps something in the 
house itself, under whose pres- 
ence the mind of the Cullum heir 
was slowly crumbling. 

Besides the strange term spok- 
en by both Emma and Laurence, 
there was one other fact which 
increased the peculiarity of the 
case. Buttrick had noticed that 
Cullum always avoided approach- 
ing a large tapestry hanging in 
the drawing room, another rem- 
nant of the patriarchy of Captain 
Hugh. The subject and rendition 
were unsettling at first glance — 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


9 


a highly realistic depiction of a 
Witches’ Sabbath. The naked 
bodies of cabalistic women were 
ruddy in the glow from a fire 
which also illumined a bleeding 
victim. After a few visits, But- 
trick had inured himself to the 
grisly scene. But Cullum would 
never pass within five feet of the 
cloth. Sometimes the doctor had 
the uncomfortable conviction 
that his patient was listening to 
the tapestry, as though hearing 
the whickering laughter of the 
coven. 

Gradually Buttrick resigned 
himself to the frustration of try- 
ing to quell a malady of the spirit 
by chemical means. A difficult 
task, at best. With such a secre- 
tive, uncooperative patient, it 
was almost an impossibility. 

Such were the reflections of 
the toil-worn leech of Sabbath- 
day as he reined his team before 
the weathered frame bungalow 
from which his father had prac- 
ticed before him. After stabling 
the horses he ate a light supper, 
then willingly gave himself to 
his mattress with a sighed hope 
that no major illnesses or acci- 
dents would befall the populace 
of the village that night. His last 
conscious thought was not a 
prayer to his Creator, but a 
mindless repetition of the el- 
dritch phrase so full of puzzle- 
ment and, in Emma’s tones, a 
taint of evil: “The guardian- 
ship.’’ 


TN late afternoon of the follow- 

ing day Buttrick stood be- 
neath the whale- jaw archway of 
Cullum House, marvelling at the 
curving bone monoliths of this 
striking manifestation of the 
family’s eccentricity. It was one 
of the two days of the week on 
which Cullum was treated both 
for his aneurism and for the 
frenzy attacking his nerves. 
Amadee was waiting behind the 
door. He ushered the doctor into 
the dank coolness of the man- 
sion. Once inside the entry-way, 
the aged Acadian drew close to 
Buttrick and seized his elbow in 
a surprisingly strong grip, a lib- 
erty he had never before taken. 

“M’sieur le docteur,” he said 
hoarsely, “do not be surprise’ if 
the master, he tell to you some 
strange thing’ today.’’ There was 
a smile on the seamed lips, but 
the coldness of Amadee’s eyes re- 
moved all traces of amiability 
from his manner. “It is some 
time now that the master, he has 
been saying strange thing’ that 
you should not believe. C’est la 
maladie — it is the sickness, noth- 
ing more.’’ 

Buttrick was repelled by the 
servant’s familiarity. During his 
visits to the house he had found 
Amadee a strange figure, given 
to eavesdropping impassively as 
Cullum made pitiful attempts at 
conversation with his physician. 
For some inexplicable reason, the 
presence of the Acadian always 


10 


FANTASTIC 


put Buttrick on his guard as 
though the stooped valet carried 
with him a hint of evil. Certainly 
the man added to the foreboding 
gloom of Cullum House. 

Buttrick pried his arm out of 
Amadee’s grip and strode quick- 
ly into the drawing room. As was 
his habit, Cullum was seated as 
far away from the tapestry as 
was physically possible. He rose 
unsteadily as the doctor entered 
the room. 

“So — so good of you to come* 
Nathan,” he said. Although his 
mind was on the verge of splin- 
tering into a thousand shards of 
madness, automatically the heir 
preserved the vestiges of a cour- 
tesy reserved for calmer spirits. 

Buttrick placed his bag on a 
richly damasked ottoman, inspect- 
ing his patient’s appearance 
with a quick, professional glance. 
He was appalled by Cullum’s de- 
cline since the last visit. The man 
was wrapped in a crimson sit- 
ting-robe that seemed made for a 
larger frame, so grievously had 
his body wasted under the bear- 
ing of his mental burden. The 
eyes were preternatu rally bright, 
staring from dark sockets. Cul- 
lum nervously plucked at the 
cord of the gown with a hand 
which shocked Buttrick by its re- 
semblance to Emma’s — blanched, 
and with yellowed nails. The doc- 
tor had seen patients harboring 
within them vile malignancies 
fall into such decay. But Cul- 


lum’s dissolution was the result 
of a mental cancer which threat- 
ened to destroy both mind and 
body. It was moot which — soul or 
flesh — ^would perish first. 

Now the man seemed inflamed 
by a strange eagerness. He mo- 
tioned Buttrick to close his bag, 
and cleared his throat nervously. 

“I fear, Nathan, that I have 
not been the best of patients. All 
your medications, all your atten- 
tions — useless.” He dismissed 
them with a wave of his blue- 
veined hand. “Nothing will re- 
lieve me. Nothing can ease the 
weight of this hideous charge I 
labor under . . .” Cullum stopped 
briefly and seemed to listen to the 
tapestry. Recovering his train of 
thought, he continued. “Unless — 
unless I somehow ease my mind 
of this guardianship I" He spat 
the word out in mingled tones of 
fear and loathing. 

“Unless I tell the secret I shall 
die, and the secret shall die with 
me. And if I tell the secret, the 
secret shall die, and I shall die 
with it. Almost a conundrum, eh 
Buttrick? A true gnomic riddle, 
eh my friend ?” 

T he physician rose to steady 
Cullum, for his speech was as- 
suming the peculiar cadence of 
madness. The man rallied, mum- 
bling “Not yet — not yet.” In a 
moment his face took on a grave 
cast as he spoke in cooler, more 
ominous tones. 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


11 


“You must have suspected, 
Nathan, that the cause of my 
agony was exceedingly strange. 
The aneurism,” he tapped his 
temple, “it is nothing. We Cul- 
lums have suffered more unusual 
maladies than that. My trouble 
lies deeper than the fragile 
flesh.” The heir paused reflective- 
ly, then continued. “I — I have 
stood it as long as I could, en- 
dured under this hideous burden 
longer than I thought possible. I 
am not as strong as Emma was. 
Not so much of a Cullum, per- 
haps. She was like my father, 
Captain Hugh, amazingly 
strong-willed. The secret of our 
family horror — I know no other 
name for it — was safe with her 
while she lived. But I — two 
years, man ! Two years of cease- 
less anxiety. And the last few 
months have been a waking ter- 
ror !” 

Buttrick had been engrossed 
by Cullum’s narration. But sud- 
denly he started. A sound, a muf- 
fled moan or cry, had issued from 
the direction of the cabalistic 
tapestry. Cullum saw the doctor’s 
apprehensive glance. 

“Not yet, my friend. Later you 
shall know all. For now, Nathan, 
hear me out.” He flicked his hand 
at Amadee, who was loitering in 
the door of the drawing-room. 
“That will be all, Amadee. Go to 
your duties.” The Acadian shuf- 
fled reluctantly into the bowels 
of the house. When his footsteps 


no longer sounded off the flaking 
walls of the passage, Cullum re- 
sumed his monologue. 

“It is now time, Nathan, that 
you knew the well-kept secret of 
this house, for I shall tell you or 
die in the attempt. Only by shar- 
ing this intolerable weight have 
I any chance of keeping my san- 
ity.” His lips trembled as he 
fought to maintain calmness. “It 
is n-not easy to disburden ones- 
self of such knowledge, but I 
must, despite the warning, or I 
shall most surely go mad. Be pa- 
tient, Nathan, and let me tell it 
in my own way.” 

Buttrick settled uneasily into 
a sofa. For a moment he felt a 
sudden impulse to deny Cullum 
the opportunity to tell his tale. 
Why should he, Nathan Buttrick, 
participate in this secret? His 
precinct was the body, not the 
diseased mind. With its austere 
inhabitants and wild setting be- 
tween the forest wastes and the 
sullen North Atlantic, Sabbath- 
day was eerie enough without 
compounding it by a knowledge 
of the secret of Cullum House. 

But gradually Buttrick’s pro- 
fessional instincts exerted them- 
selves. If Cullum did not gain 
some mental relief, either the 
torments he underwent would 
render him mad, or his aneurism 
would burst under the strain. 
The doctor settled back and ac- 
cepted a dark sherry from his 
patient’s trembling hand.

FANTASTIC 


“Nathan," said Cullum, "have 
you ever heard the name — 
LigeaT’ 

“Ligea was the . . . second 
wife, I believe, of your father 
Captain Hugh,” answered But- 
trick. 

“Yes, if she can be called — a 
wife!” 

Immediately Buttrick knew 
the reason for Cullum’s bitter 
statement. The doctor had been 
only a child when Ligea came to 
Sabbathday, yet the bizarre tales 
the townspeople told about her 
were preserved in his memory. 
After the death of his first wife, 
the mother of Laurence and 
Emma, Captain Hugh Cullum 
had consigned his children to the 
care of a relative. He then em- 
barked on his last voyage as mas- 
ter of the steamer Ogunquit to 
the Baltic port of Riga. When he 
returned to Sabbathday almost 
two years later, he brought with 
him the numerous spoils of Yan- 
kee trading and a mistress for 
Cullum House, the dark Ligea. 

G rotesque rumors about 
this woman soon sprang up 
amidst the villagers. Perhaps 
some originated in the mouths of 
goodwives who envied her exotic 
charms. For Ligea was oddly 
beautiful — a tall woman, with a 
luminous Eastern complexion, 
sinuous in her movements, heav- 
ily accented in her speech. Li- 
gea’s most distinctive feature 


was her long raven hair of a 
black deeper than the northern 
forest night. 

Whatever their origin, the 
stories about Ligea soon were the 
common coin of conversation 
around the hearths of Sabbath- 
day. It was said that she had 
brought the nighthawks to Cul- 
lum House. Before her coming, 
these nocturnal flyers had soared 
only over the backlands far from 
town. Now they roosted in the 
trees of the estate, trembling the 
night air with the beat of wings. 

More serious, some reported 
that Ligea had been seen on Wal- 
purgis Night wantoning naked 
through the woods at the fringe 
of town. One individual who had 
been abroad at that hour swore 
that a glowing cloud had passed 
in from the sea over Sabbathday, 
and that voices could be heard 
mumbling in strange tongues 
from within the floating mass. 
An ancient dame who dwelt alone 
near Gallowglass Hill averred 
that Ligea had spent many af- 
ternoons with the few Indian 
sachems still alive, the degener- 
ate remainder of the Pequot 
tribe. This nearly-extinct race, it 
was said, held powers over air 
and sea. 

The more intelligent of the 
townsfolk dismissed these tales 
as fantasies. Yet all knew that 
Ligea exerted a strange hold on 
Captain Hugh. The gruff skipper 
was quite deferential to her in 


THE CRIB OF HELL

public, a far cry from his callous 
treatment of his first wife. There 
were some who even noticed more 
than a touch of fear in his atti- 
tude toward the tall woman 
whom he bore on his arm. 

However, in her public behav- 
ior the woman was impeccable — 
haughty of mien, knowledgeable 
in the social graces, distant yet 
polite. During the couples’ visits 
to town she comported herself as 
befitted the wife of a monied 
landowner. Only a few noted 
that occasionally she exchanged 
knowing glances with the most 
depraved of the town’s moral out- 
casts. 

A year after her arrival in 
Sabbathday Ligea was big with 
child. At this time Hugh Cullum 
ceased his frequent visits to 
town and seemed to enter retire- 
ment at the end of Windham 
Road. The village believed that 
he had secluded himself in defer- 
ence to his wife’s condition. Not 
a soul understood that behind 
the captain’s bluff facade lay a 
spirit sorely harried by some 
knowledge which he could impart 
to no other person. 

Several days after her confine- 
ment was due to end the news 
reached Sabbathday that both 
Ligea and her babe had perished 
in childbed. The father of Nath- 
an Buttrick had been in attend- 
ance. In answer to the many 
queries he replied that there was 
nothing he could have done, and 


divulged no other details of the 
tragedy. Nathan recalled that his 
father had been unusually silent 
for days after the event, as 
though meditating on some in- 
comprehensible problem. Once he 
had told his son that if he as- 
pired to be a physician, there 
was something about the Cul- 
lums that he should know in the 
future. But then the normal 
course of town life was resumed. 
The remains of Ligea were cre- 
mated and transported to her na- 
tive land as she had wished. The 
small casket of the child took its 
place among the Cullum ances- 
tors in the family crs^pt. And 
Nathan Buttrick never heard the 
Cullum secret from the lips of his 
father, for the man died of a 
heart seizure a few months later. 

“She was a witch, damn her 
eyes!’’ cried Cullum. The heir 
had become noticeably less calm 
toward the end of Buttrick’s nar- 
ration of the few facts he knew of 
Ligea. Now a torrent of suppres- 
sion emotion broke forth. “And 
it is not dead, do you hear? Not 
dead]” 

OUTTRICK leapt to restrain 
Cullum, who seemed ready to 
run from the room. At the same 
moment a hideous clamor issued 
from the direction of the tapes- 
try, a scarcely human screeching 
accompanied by thudding im- 
pacts as though a body were 
hurling itself at the wall. 


14 


FANTASTIC 


“It heard — it heard!” raved 
Cullum. He swung around and 
faced the cloth. “You cannot 
hold me in bondage any longer. 
The guardianship is at an end! 
At last, an end. . . His final 
words choked off in a sob. Cul- 
lum pitched into a faint on the 
settee. 

The vicious sounds from the 
tapestry grew in intensity until 
the cloth and the wall behind it 
trembled. Amadee entered the 
room on the run, his features 
contorted with rage. Apparently 
he had overheard the entire 
scene. 

“The weak pig,” he snarled, 
“he has doom’ us all — we are 
dead men, M’sieur, dead men!” 
He vanished down the hall, his 
footsteps giving way to the grind 
of a heavy door being swung on 
its hinges. In a few moments 
Buttrick heard the crack of a 
bullwhip over the horrid ulula- 
tions. A note of pain entered the 
screams. They tapered off into 
piteous whimpers, until silence 
returned to Cullum House. 

Buttrick knelt beside the heir, 
struggling to revive him. For a 
moment he feared the aneurism 
had burst. But the eyelids trem- 
bled, and slowly the man re- 
gained his senses. 

“Ah, the relief, Nathan,” Cul- 
lum sighed. “No longer a prison- 
er in my own house. No longer 
keeper of the vile heritage Emma 
passed on to me.” 


“Great God, Laurence,” cried 
Buttrick, “what have you hidden 
behind that wall ?” 

“I could not describe it,” he 
answered. “Walk to the tapestry. 
You shall see it for yourself.” 

Buttrick moved unsteadily to- 
ward the rich cloth, his breath- 
ing suspended in anticipation of 
whatever was to occur. 

“Open the tapestry with the 
cord by your hand,” directed 
Callum. 

The doctor grasped the weight- 
ed end of the cord. He closed his 
eyes for a moment, opened them, 
then tugged at the cord. The tap- 
estry slid back smoothly across 
the wall. Beneath it, the wall was 
discolored but blank, except for 
a small glassed orifice at eye 
level. Buttrick hesitated. He 
glanced at Laurence, who feebly 
motioned to him from the settee, 
then fixed his eye to the peep- 
hole. A low moan escaped the 
physician’s lips as his hand came 
up to clutch his throat. 

The orifice gave a view through 
the thick wall into a smaller 
chamber behind the drawing 
room. Immediately opposite was 
a heavy steel door, with a similar 
peephole and a sturdy grating at 
the bottom through which a man 
might crawl, were it open. 
Gnawed bones and a basin of wa- 
ter lay before the grill, which 
was apparently an opening for 
inserting food into the chamber. 
A grayish light emanated from 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


15 


tiny clerestory windows along 
two sides beneath the ceiling. 
Knots of thread-like filaments — 
black, brown, and yellow — lit- 
tered the floor. 

Crouched in the far corner was 
the tenant of this chamber, a 
spectre so inhuman that But- 
trick’s vision momentarily 
blurred from the shock. It hulked 
panting on its hands, a living hu- 
man torso, if such a distortion of 
man’s form can be designated 
thusly. Raven hair fell in hanks 
and tangles from a misshapen 
skull. Bright, feverish eyes 
glared out from beneath the 
shaggy brows. From the face 
projected only a rudimentary 
nose, its nostrils dilating as an 
animal would breathe. The lips 
were tensed in a snarl, revealing 
discolored teeth more like the 
fangs of a carnivore. 

T he thing was naked save for 
a ragged breechclout tied 
about its middle. The torso 
showed superhuman muscular 
development — arms as thick as 
fenceposts, a barrel chest partly 
covered by a pelt. The lower ex- 
tremities were piteously with- 
ered, dragging behind the upper 
body. Yet that monstrous form 
carried itself to and fro in the 
chamber with remarkable agil- 
ity, supporting its weight on the 
arms and talon-like hands. As it 
lunged from one corner to the 
other, the creature sounded an 


ominous murmur from deep 
within its dark breast. 

“Oh my dear God,” whispered 
Buttrick, unbelieving before the 
grisly sight. He had seen men 
mangled by awful accidents in 
the logging camps, and even the 
pitiable distortions of infant 
bodies in stillbirths. But never 
had the physician’s entire con- 
sciousness writhed before such a 
gross malformation of the human 
body. He slumped weakly against 
the wall beside the peephole. 

“What is it, Laurence?” he 
asked. “Where — where did it 
come from?” 

“Now you realize the desperate 
burden I have carried these 
months, Nathan,” replied Cul- 
lum. “That thing has been in our 
charge since the death of my 
father’s second wife. It is — Li- 
gea’s Hell-Child !” 

As he watched Buttrick’s reac- 
tion to the spectacle behind the 
tapestry, a transformation over- 
came Cullum. He seemed more in 
control of himself as though the 
sharing of the secret with an- 
other not in the blood line had 
relieved a great pressure within 
his spirit. Seeing Buttrick’s re- 
vulsion, Cullum had the presence 
of mind to fill another glass from 
the squat ship’s decanter and of- 
fer the stimulant to the doctor, 
who had moved slowly away from 
the wall like a sleepwalker. 

“Sit down, Nathan, and calm 
yourself,” ordered the heir. “I’m 


16 


FANTASTIC 


sure you must have many ques- 
tions about our — bad seed.” 

When Buttrick had composed 
himself, Cullum spoke volubly 
about the origin of the chamber- 
dweller. The doctor listened as 
his host told him of Ligea’s dy- 
ing threat to the house of Cul- 
lum. Unless they maintained her 
infant in secrecy until its matu- 
rity, they would perish. The 
guardianship, as she called it, 
must be passed from member to 
member. Only death could release 
a guardian, who was responsible 
for the care and nourishment of 
the creature. They would know, 
Ligea said, when the child no 
longer needed their protection. 

Captain Hugh Cullum had al- 
ways scoffed at superstitions and 
curses. But suddenly the occult 
had come under his own eaves in 
the presence of that incredible 
child, surrounded by a brooding 
evil even then in its infancy. He 
knew that he had not fathered 
such a monster. Gradually the 
conviction grew within his mind 
that Ligea had consorted with a 
spirit of darkness, and that the 
babe was the token of their devil- 
ish love. 

Captain Hugh would allow the 
child no baptism. It was placed 
in the strong-room behind the 
main parlor, a chamber which 
the guardians came to call, sar- 
donically, The Crib. From that 
time forward, the tenant of that 
dark room behind the tapestry 


was known as The Hell-Child. 

"And so, Nathan, if Ligea’s 
words were true, then you are 
listening to a dead man. The 
guardian who betrays the secret 
must die, you know.” 

"Superstitious nonsense!” 
cried Buttrick, who had recov- 
ered from his initial shock. 
"Why, look at you, man. You’re 
more relaxed than I’ve seen you 
in months. Now, Laurence, I 
can’t yet explain that thing in 
thei-e, or why it’s survived so 
long despite its grave malforma- 
tion. But it must have a natural 
explanation. I admit that at first 
I was shocked. It’s a hideous 
thing. Yet I can see nothing that 
you should fear in it. Perhaps 
we can arrange for an institution 
to take over its care, relieving 
you of the burden. As to its being 
a Hell-Child — really, Laurence, 
I’d expect this type of thinking 
more of an upland farmer than 
the Cullum heir.” 

“That is because you do not 
fully understand the terrible 
threat of the creature!” cried 
Cullum. “It must be destroyed, 
Nathan, before it can commit 
more of its evil. It’s just begun, 
I tell you !” 

B uttrick put out his hand to 
steady Cullum, who was be- 
coming agitated again. “What 
evil ? What are you talking about, 
Laurence?” 

“Do you remember that first 

17 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


night I called you — how frantic 
I was ?” The doctor nodded. “And 
do you remember Rupel Old- 
ham?” 

Buttrick involuntarily winced. 
Oldham had been found lying in 
a foot of stagnant water near 
a fire-road through Mohegan 
Swamp. Buttrick had signed the 
death-certificate of the aged 
muskrat trapper. The body had 
been badly mutilated, and a look 
of utter horror was indelibly 
stamped on the face. 

“You don’t mean — that?” 
asked Buttrick, pointing toward 
the wall. 

“Cullum nodded. “It broke 
out,” he said helplessly. “We had 
underestimated its strength, and 
it burst through the wooden door 
which the steel door you saw la- 
ter replaced. Amadee and I fol- 
lowed it as quickly as we could. 
It was dark. The spring rains 
had muddied the ground.” Cul- 
lum’s voice became dreamy as he 
relived the gruesome event. 

“At first Amadee and I didn’t 
know where to look. We stood in 
the drive, he with the bullwhip 
and myself carrying the lantern. 
It could have gone off in any di- 
rection. But then — then we heard 
the nighthawks crying over Mo- 
hegan Swamp in the valley be- 
hind the estate. A terrible, fierce 
sound, Laurence. They were 
swarming and diving as though 
mad.” 

“We ran through the forest on 


the fire-road. The sound of the 
birds got louder, more shrill, un- 
til we could see against the gray 
sky the place over which they 
were swarming. I remember 
wishing that I had had the pres- 
ence of mind to bring a pistol. 
But then the light from the lan- 
tern showed us its form ahead. 
Oh Nathan, Oldham had come 
down to check his traps, and it 
caught him there in the mud and 
scummy water. When we ran up 
it was — feeding !” 

“Amadee lashed it with the 
whip, and it drew back. I saw 
that we could do nothing for 
Oldham. The expression on his 
face — terrible. Between the two 
of us we drove the creature back 
to the house and into The Crib. 
It was more docile then, feared 
the bite of the whip more than 
now.” Cullum paused and wet his 
lips with the sherry. “But the 
atrocity so unsettled me that I 
had to call you for relief, or I 
would have lost my mind.” 

“We should have recognized 
this murderous act as an unmis- 
takeable sign that it was ap- 
proaching its maturity, Nathan. 
But we thought the killing of 
Oldham was an accident, a 
chance encounter. No more than 
a month later, Arnold, my 
groundskeeper, passed away. He 
was the last of the servants, save 
Amadee. At night the beast broke 
out again. I was awakened by the 
nighthawks massing over the 


18 


FANTASTIC 


house. The coffin lay within the 
parlor. That thing had over- 
turned it, and was tearing, slash- 
ing . . .” Cullum clenched his 
fists in agony. “Do you under- 
stand what I’ve been living with, 
Nathan? Do you wonder that my 
nerves are gone?” 

B UTTRICK stirred uncomfort- 
ably. He was being drawn 
into the macabre web of Cullum’s 
narration. The doctor began to 
feel unsafe sitting only a few 
yards away from the tapestry. 
How many times had he entered 
the decaying drawing-room to 
treat the master of Cullum 
House, oblivious to the existence 
of a horror separated from him 
by only a few inches of plaster 
and lath? 

“We then knew,” continued 
Cullum, “that its ghastly appe- 
tite had been whetted. We real- 
ized that these events were not 
mere chance. The evil thing 
mothered by my father’s second 
wife — I cannot call her my step- 
mother — had reached its matu- 
rity. For a week after we interred 
Arnold it screamed. I shall hear 
its cries until my ears are 
stopped by death. Ravenous, fe- 
rocious howls which sounded 
even beyond the walls of the 
house. Amadee and his bullwhip 
could not control it. I stuffed my 
ears with cotton, took laudanum, 
drank myself into unconscious- 
ness — everything failed. That 


hideous keening could not be 
suppressed. It was then, at the 
end of my wits, that I made the 
decision for which, if ever a man 
were damned, I shall be. I had to 
stop the screaming, Nathan, do 
you understand that?” 

Buttrick shook his head slow- 
ly, scarce daring to consider 
what awful revelation he would 
hear next. 

“I ordered Amadee — ah, even 
now I cannot bring myself to 
pronounce the words!” Cullum 
fought visibly to control his ris- 
ing emotion. He sprang from the 
settee and paced the room. “Ama- 
dee, in addition to being my only 
servant, is also,” he blurted the 
words out. “custodian of the Sab- 
bathday Burial Ground. Do you 
understand my meaning?” 

“Then the bones in the cham- 
ber, and those fibers — hanks of 
hair?” Buttrick asked incredu- 
lously. 

“How many evenings have I 
slumped in that very chair, lis- 
tening to that beast at its unholy 
supper ! How often have I consid- 
ered suicide, anything to free me 
of this vile guardianship. Even 
Amadee has become infected by 
it — I truly believe he enjoys tend- 
ing the creature and disciplining 
it with his bullwhip. He derives 
a sense of power from those du- 
ties. The old man thinks me weak 
and scorns me because my nerves 
cannot stand the strain. But 
what a burden — God help me, I 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


19 


am the protector of a ghovlV' 

A long silence followed the im- 
passioned confession. The room 
had become oppressively thick- 
atmosphered. Buttrick opened 
the French doors which led to a 
terrace and thence the drive. The 
sky was yet aglow, and only the 
drone of frogs at Mohegan 
Swamp heralded the approach of 
night. The birds roosting in the 
trees about the house had not yet 
begun their darkling flights. 

The doctor turned and ad- 
dressed Cullum. “Is there any 
danger that it will break out 
again, Laurence?” 

“The steel door has thus far 
resisted its attempts,” he re- 
plied. “Occasionally it hurls it 
self at the door for an hour at a 
time. Its ferocity is appalling. 
But the door and its frame re- 
main fast.” The heir sighed deep- 
ly. “Yet a mere steel door cannot 
be sufficient to hold such a malig- 
nant evil. It must be destroyed, 
Nathan, and quickly. I can no 
longer protect the town from its 
appetite. And now that I have 
discovered the Cullum secret to 
you, I feel that if we do not act 
soon the thing will be at large, 
with no one to stop it. For it 
heard me betray it, I am sure, 
and craves my death.” 

Buttrick was convinced. Now 
his mind no longer operated in 
accord with the civilized virtues 
of reason and mercy. His own ex- 
perience that day at Cullum 


House, and his host’s desperate 
words, had brought to life with- 
in him the savage’s fear of the 
unknown. He agreed to assist in 
the extermination of the ci'eature, 
and swore that no word of the 
proceedings would ever pass his 
lips. 

Since Cullum assured him that 
he could spend another night in 
the house with the Hell-Child, 
Buttrick decided to return to 
Sabbathday. On the morrow he 
would return to the estate to plan 
the destruction and interment of 
the beast, for they would need 
daylight to dig its unholy resting 
place. 

On the portico of the mansion 
beneath the arched jaw-bones, 
Cullum seized Buttrick’s hand in 
a firm grip. “I only wish my fa- 
ther had taken this course in the 
beginning,” he said. “Then per- 
haps he, Emma, and myself 
would have been spared the 
blight which has sapped our 
lives.” He ran his hand along the 
cool ivory of the curving white 
monoliths. “I know that wher- 
ever he is, my father approves 
the action we must take.” 

Buttrick nodded in silent 
agreement. He bade the heir a 
good night, and turned his team 
onto the darkness of Windham 
Road. As he left the grounds of 
the estate, the nighthawks were 
beginning their evening clamor. 
Their rasping cries banished the 
peace of the autumn evening. 


20 


FANTASTIC 


A fter his return to the bun- 
galow the doctor lay sleep- 
less, distracted by vivid mental 
phantasms of what he had heard 
and witnessed that evening. 
Each time he closed his eyes the 
scene in The Crib flashed across 
the screen of his conscious mind 
in all its loathsome detail. He 
could not erase from his memory 
the glowering countenance of the 
Hell-Child, a face so evil it 
seemed impossible that flesh and 
bone could be tortured into re- 
ceiving the stamp of such malig- 
nancy. Buttrick could well under- 
stand why Captain Hugh had 
disclaimed, parentage of the child. 

And now Buttrick himself had 
been drawn into the Cullum hor- 
ror. He had sworn to aid in the 
destruction of a thing which 
might still bear within it a spark 
of humanity, despite Cullum’s 
heated denials and the mystery 
of its parentage. Vicious, instinc- 
tively homicidal, yes; but was 
this enough, he asked himself, 
enough cause to betray a greater 
oath — that one which bound 
Nathan Buttrick to use his skills 
only for the preservation of life ? 
It was a quandary, and the man 
writhed under the weight of his 
contradictory obligations. 

The doctor had thus lain star- 
ing at the slowly rising patch of 
moonlight on his wall for three 
hours, when the telephone beside 
his bed rang. With a sudden 
clairvoyance Buttrick knew that 


this was no ordinary call sum- 
moning him to the sickbed of a 
villager. He swung out of the bed 
and snatched the earpiece from 
the hook. The voice of Laurence 
Cullum dinned in his ear. 

“Nathan, come quickly, man. 
We can’t hold it. It’s breaking 
out of The Crib!’’ 

Over Cullum’s voice came the 
sound of splintering wood and a 
ravening ululation such as never 
sprang from human throat. The 
telephone crashed to the floor as 
Buttrick leapt to struggle into 
his clothes. He vaulted across the 
yard to the barn, scarce feeling 
the bite of the early hoarfrost. 
With frantic speed he harnessed 
the team and urged them out of 
their warm quarters into the 
chill darkness of the road where 
the moon hardly penetrated the 
roof of overhanging trees. 

Five minutes after the call, the 
wild-eyed horses lunged through 
the shadows of Penaubsket 
Bridge onto the gravel of Wind- 
ham Road. Although the doctor 
was a good master to his animals, 
now he whipped them cruelly. He 
called the two mares by name, 
hurling imprecations foreign to 
his lips in an effort to gain more 
speed. Black masses of maple and 
oak lashed by, their sharp twig- 
ends striking blood from But- 
trick’s face when the surrey 
veered too close to the road’s 
edge. Twice it seemed that all — 
horses, surrey, and driver — must 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


21 


surely fall to perdition, so head- 
long was their flight in rounding 
curves where granite outcrop- 
pings changed the road’s direc- 
tion. If a goodman of the town 
had been abroad at that hour, he 
would have crossed himself in ut- 
ter terror at the approach of the 
flying team and whipman. 

It seemed an age to Buttrick, 
but at last the lights of Cullum 
House glimmered through the 
thickets ahead. At the stone pil- 
lars which marked the entrance 
to the estate the horses shied, 
nearly throwing the doctor from 
his seat. The whip cracked once, 
twice, but they would not enter. 
The team stood ready to bolt in 
the face of a terror which their 
senses could detect even at that 
far remove. 

C URSING, Buttrick leapt down 
from the surrey and made 
for the house afoot. The rains of 
early autumn had washed in- 
numerable gullies into the clay of 
the drive. Several times he stum- 
bled, almost twisting an ankle 
beneath him. Over the sound of 
his labored breathing came a 
confusion of high-pitched cries. 
The nighthawks were swarming 
above the house in a dense cloud. 
Their mass eclipsed the light of 
the moon as they climbed to an 
apogee, plummeted suicidally to- 
ward the ground, then arced up- 
wards. All about him the doctor 
heard the beat of their wings. 


Nearing the great house But- 
trick saw that the French doors 
which he had opened in another 
world, it seemed, were still ajar. 
The parlor within was lighted. 
Sobbing from his exertions he 
lurched onto the terrace and 
leaned against the door frame. 
“Laurence,” he cried. “Laurence, 
where are you ?” 

The doctor’s gaze slowly swept 
the room. The ottoman on which 
he had set his bag that afternoon 
lay on its side, the stufling ex- 
posed through a long rent in the 
fabric. On the far wall the tapes- 
try hung in folds from one of its 
corners. Beneath, the discolored 
area of the wall framed a gaping 
hole partially obstructed with 
shards of plaster and fang-like 
laths. By main force, the captive 
behind that wall had clawed and 
butted its way out of the Crib. 

Buttrick stepped into the room, 
aghast at the wreckage of the 
once-sumptuous chamber. From 
behind an overturned sofa a 
moan broke the stillness, more 
like a sigh than an expression of 
pain. Cullum lay crumpled 
against the wall, hurled there by 
the inhuman force of the thing as 
it rushed from its confinement. 

“Laurence! Are you all right, 
man?” cried the physician. There 
was a deep gash on Cullum’s 
brow. 

“See — see to Amadee. In the 
hall. I — I’m afraid it caught him, 
Nathan.” 


22 


FANTASTIC 


Buttrick found the Acadian 
halfway down the hallway which 
lead to the steel door of the Crib. 
The Hell-Child had seized him at 
his middle, and dashed him fa- 
tally against the floor. Beside the 
dead servant lay the bullwhip, a 
puny weapon against a force of 
such unutterable malevolence. 

The doctor returned quickly to 
attend Cullum. The shock of the 
events could prove dangerous to 
the aneurism. The weak spot of 
the brain artery might rupture 
from the slightest stress. But the 
heir indicated dazedly that he 
was unharmed except for the 
head wound. 

“It went outside,” whispered 
Cullum. “I could hear it scrab- 
bling about on the portico before 
you came. Thank God it’s stopped 
screaming. I could not bear that 
sound another minute.” 

“Are there any firearms in the 
house?” asked Buttrick. 

“Only an ancient pistol which 
failed me.” Cullum pointed to an 
old handgun lying at the middle 
of the floor. “I tried to fire at it 
as it came through the wall, but 
the mechanism was rusty from 
age. The beast flicked me off like 
a doll and went for Amadee, per- 
haps because he took so much 
pleasure in whipping it. But it 
will return to finish me, Nathan, 
because it has now matured, and 
needs its guardian no longer.” 
Cullum smiled weakly as a wist- 
ful expression fixed itself upon 


his pallid face. “If death is the 
price of freedom from that child 
of the Pit, then I shall pay it 
gladly,” he said. 

B uttrick suddenly stiffened. 

Somewhere beyond the open 
doors of the entry-way he heard 
the sound of deep, animal respi- 
rations. A growl loosed itself 
from a savage throat. 

“I must close and bar those 
doors,” the doctor muttered to 
himself, for Cullum had lapsed 
into an almost trance-like state. 
He grasped a heavy poker and 
walked carefully through the hall. 
“If it comes at me,” he thought, 
“I must slash at the eyes. The 
eyes.” 

The main doors of the house 
stood thrown open to the night. 
Although it now rode the tree- 
tops, the moon illumined the steps 
up which Buttrick would have 
raced had he not entered through 
the French doors. The cries of the 
ominous birds had ceased. They 
roosted in the elms and oaks, 
as though awaiting a climactic 
event. 

The doctor peered out onto the 
lawn, keeping well within the 
shadows of the entry-way. Noth- 
ing stirred. He stepped into the 
doorframe and quickly scanned 
right and left. Again there was 
only the wash of moonlight on 
the lawn and long-deserted walks. 
No sound was audible except an 
occasional chirrup from the trees. 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


23 


Buttrick exhaled slowly. It 
seemed that the thing had run 
off, perhaps to Mohegan Swamp 
where it had claimed its first vic- 
tim. This was work for a search 
party in the morning, not for a 
middle-aged physician unarmed 
except for a poker. 

Wiping his brow against his 
sleeve, Buttrick stepped onto the 
portico beneath the massive jaw- 
bones. The moon caught the 
whiteness of the eccentric arch- 
way. He ran his palm along the 
ivory smoothness, grateful for a 
touch of cool solidity. Standing 
there for a moment, the man 
seemed to gain strength from the 
contact of his hand with the 
curving pillars of bone. On the 
steps of the mansion he took a 
final surveying glance over the 
grounds, unwilling to stray far- 
ther from the light. All was 
quiet. “We will run the beast to 
earth in the bogs come sunup,” 
he thought. “Surely it cannot es- 
cape us there.” 

Suddenly the trees at the edge 
of the estate swayed at their tops 
as the nighthawks again winged 
aloft. The doctor’s calmness left 
him. He started up the steps to 
regain the relative security of 
the house. But as he mounted the 
last step his eyes caught a dark 
mass hulking at the very top of 
the arch where the whalebones 
intersected. At the same moment 
a guttural cry which seemed to 
tremble the entire portico pealed 


down at him. Buttrick’s head 
snapped up. On the peak of the 
arch, balanced on its claw-like 
hands, crouched the Hell-Child! 
Its long, snarled hair cascaded 
down over the joint where the 
tops of the bones were clamped 
together. The fantastically de- 
veloped shoulder and arm mus- 
cles knotted as the creature pre- 
pared to hurl itself downward 
upon Buttrick. 

In the split-second it took his 
arm to bring the poker up, he 
realized that the thing had ex- 
pected him to enter through the 
main door when he arrived in an- 
swer to Cullum’s call for help. It 
had climbed to the top of the 
arch, hidden there by the shadow 
of the eaves, in order to fall upon 
him as he entered the house. 
Then all thought ceased for 
Nathan Buttrick as he saw the 
macabre figure let go the top of 
the arch and launch itself at him 
with a bellow. 

T he poker flashed sideways in 
a vicious arc, aimed at the 
point in space where the eyes 
should have been at that moment. 
But it smote the empty air. For 
as Buttrick began his stroke the 
long, raven hair of the beast 
caught in the ironwork which 
braced the top of Hugh Cullum’s 
arch. The momentum of its lunge 
carried the Hell-Child clear of the 
ivory columns. It plummeted 
downward for the merest frac- 


24 


FANTASTIC 


tion of a heartbeat — then a terri- 
ble jerk ceased its plunge. It 
swung between the columns like 
a grotesque marionette, hanging 
by its own matted hair. 

The doctor could not breathe 
as he gaped at the frantic con- 
tortions of the creature. The 
cruel arms flailed and beat the 
air as it struggled to haul itself 
back to the top of the arch. From 
that brutish throat came a 
scream of incredible fury. The 
face grimaced from pain and 
rage. Flecks of foam spotted the 
snarling lips. For a moment it 
seemed that the hair surely must 
part, unable to support such a 
weight. But then a report like a 
muffled gunshot stilled the writh- 
ing of that hideous form. Its neck 
broken, the Hell-Child hung limp- 
ly above the steps of the house it 
had terrorized through the long 
decades. 

Unstrung by the terrible self- 
execution he had witnessed. But- 
trick fell to his knees on the floor 
of the portico. For minutes he 
sagged there, his fingers still 
gripping the haft of the useless 
poker. The trembling which shook 
his entire frame gradually sub- 
sided. Suddenly remembering the 
wounded heir who lay inside, he 
roused himself and entered the 
house. 

Cullum was sitting as before, 
propped against the wall. His face 
was ashen, but his eyes glim- 
mered with surprise as Buttrick 


knelt beside him. “You — you are 
alive, Nathan!” he whispered. 
“Does the beast still live?” 

The doctor quickly related the 
grisly death of the Hell-Child. It 
was apparent to him that his 
friend was falling into a decline 
from which he would never recov- 
er. The aneurism had been fatally 
disturbed by the night’s events. 

“Then I am afree!” cried Cul- 
lum. “At long last free of that 
terrible presence. Ah, liberty. 
Blessed, blessed liberty . . .” 
The voice of the heir trailed off in 
a final sob. Buttrick gently placed 
a pillow beneath the still head, 
and closed the eyes. The master 
of Cullum House, the last guard- 
ian of the Hell-Child, was dead. 

P >R a long time the physician 
stood in the shambles of the 
parlor, trying to fathom some 
meaning in what he had experi- 
enced. Two corpses lay in that si- 
lent mansion. Beneath the whale- 
jaw archway hung the carcass of 
the family’s child of darkness, 
claimed by this architectural 
whim of its first guardian. The 
grim sequence of events was too 
unsettling to comprehend. 

But now it was time for action. 
Impelled by some allegiance 
which endured even the death of 
the last Cullum, the doctor re- 
solved never to divulge the horror 
in which he had participated. 
Crawling into the Crib through 
the broken wall, he cleaned the 


THE CRIB OF HELL 


25 


chamber of all traces of the Hell- 
Child’s occupancy. On the portico 
he cut down the monstrous body 
and loaded it onto the surrey. 

Buttrick inched the surrey 
down the dark fire road to Mo- 
hegan Swamp. In a desolate reach 
of the bog he interred the re- 
mains of the vicious life which 
had brought Cullum House to 
ruin. Only then did he call the 
Sabbathday constable. 

The account which that officer 
received was deliberately intend- 
ed to excite no undue curiosity. 
As Buttrick told it, he had re- 
ceived a nighttime call from the 
heir requesting medication for 
his condition. Near the end of 
their conversation the line 
abruptly went dead. Upon his ar- 
rival at the house he found that 
apparently a burglar of consider- 
able strength had slain Amadee. 
Cullum had been struck once, as 
the single gash on his brow testi- 
fied. The blow had fatally ag- 
gravated his aneurism. Foiled by 
the steel door of the strongroom 
behind the parlor, the thief and 
murderer had broken through the 
wall into the chamber. But he 
found no treasure, for the room 
had not been used for years. 

No person in Sabbathday, not 
even the investigating constable, 
questioned the veracity of the 
doctor’s explanation. Nathan 
Buttrick hid within himself the 
memory of that ghastly night at 


Cullum House until death eased 

him of the woeful burden. 

* * * 

Now, residents of the village 
rarely speak of the Cullum trag- 
edy. Since there were no heirs, 
the great house reverted to Wind- 
ham County and was razed for its 
timbers. In the town cemetery the 
Cullum family crypt is sealed for- 
ever and the Sabbathday Burial 
Ground is a place of peace, em- 
braced on all sides by the north- 
ern forest. 

But in Mohegan Swamp, the 
nighthawks disturb the twilight 
calm. They have inhabited the 
lowlands since the pulling down 
of Cullum House. At sundown, 
while the main flock wheels and 
cries over the brackish water, a 
few night-fliers roost atop a curi- 
ous mound near the shoulder of a 
fire-road through the swamp. 
Each year the mound grows some- 
what higher. 

The forest warden who first 
noticed the growth believed it to 
be merely a subterranean tangle 
of living willow roots sent out by 
the trees which overhang the bog. 
Yet the birds who frequent the 
hillock utter strange, fervid cries 
as if urging on the evolution of 
something within the peculiar 
pile. It is unlikely that the mound 
will stir the curiosity of the 
townsfolk. Whatever phenomenon 
is at work will reach completion 
undisturbed. the end

FANTASTIC 


PLAYMATE 

By DAVID R. BUNCH 


Long legs, short legs .... voice tapes 
throat, voice tapes childish .... prob> 
lems, problems, always problems, even 
in the well-run world of Moderan. 


I T was on a July Monday that 
Little Sister was under his 
window, very early, with a big 
box in her arms. The vapor cover 
that day was pink, as indeed it 
would be for all of July, as set 
by the Central Vapor Shield Con- 
trol and the Vapor Light Saving 
people. The temperature was con- 
trolled to a pleasant 70 degrees F. 
inside and outside, and he, as 
usual, was working on a formula. 

“My little playmate came,” she 
shouted, “my little sister! Come 
see.” 

He, plastic-legged and iron-x 
“replaced,” arose from his hip- 
snuggie chair and went to the 
edge of his door. “What’s the 
nonsense?” he asked, metal- 
fogged and weary. “Why aren’t 
you napping? Or behaving with 


Mox?” Mox was her iron man 
who looked after her needs like 
a mother, in the red plastic hut 
where she lived apart from other 
folk while awaiting the age of 
“replacements.” 

“It’s my little companion !” Lit- 
tle Sister shrieked. “I sent for 
her. She came today, in the mail.” 

He rubbed his eyes with the 
backs of his gold-seal hands. He 
tried to think across the metal 
fields. A man of Advanced Times, 
he had submitted to many iron-x, 
and a few gold-seal, “replace- 
ments” since coming up from 
Olderun, in a move toward dura- 
bility, in a move to conquer im- 
naortality for the corporeal self. 
But sometimes this metal self, 
that was fast becoming his main 
self, dominated the flesh strips 


27 


to such an extent that he found 
it difficult to force thoughts to 
track the petty paths of every- 
day. Across the pathless fields of 
the high dimensions he was a 
keen hot hound on the scent of 
formulae. With what was left of 
his family, Little Sister, he some- 
times found it hard going even 
to converse on plain terms. “Tell 
me slowly,” he pleaded. 

She took a deep breath. Her 
good full chest swelled in a tri- 
umph of flesh and bone. Her 
brown eyes were sparkle-bright 
when she said, “I mustn’t grow 
up alone, even if I am the last 
little girl. As I await the age of 
‘replacement’ I must have a com- 
panion, which same just came in 
the mail. Daddy. And you will 
put her together. Daddy, so we 
can play. I have named her al- 
ready — Little Slots.” 

Slots was a box full of slotted 
metal, a few wires, some power 
wafers, many tapes, a head, vari- 
ous curved pieces of white plas- 
tic, certain parts that were al- 
most flesh and the printed sheet 
of directions. Slots was a pile of 
junk and a headache confronting 
a man dedicated to solitude, eter- 
nity and calm, companionless 
thinking on universal deep prob- 
lems. Slots as she was, unassem- 
bled, had cost five hundred 
thousand dollars cash — by gift 
certificate from the Organization 
for the Entertainment of Little 
Flesh People. 


There was a clatter in his 
joints, of metal scraping on metal 
and the wincing of the fiesh 
strips, as he knelt to one knee 
there on the gray bare yard and 
took up the box that contained 
Slots. He opened the box and 
saw a wax-warm face smirking 
up at him, an enigmatic face that 
could have been a nine year old 
girl’s face, or a much older 
girl’s face, made of plastic and 
wreathed in real hair. The me- 
chanical mouth tumbled open and 
beautifully formed white teeth 
gleamed out of the rubbery lips. 
“I’ll bite your big feet off if you 
aren’t good to me,” the beautiful 
fliilatious head threatened right 
away, mechanically and pleas- 
antly enough. Then a clamor 
started up, “Change the tape, 
change the tape . . 


H e jumped like a bucket full 
of the sun had just come 
high-boiling down through all 
those miles, through all the pink 
vapor shield, to spill on a jot of 
his flesh. When he jumped, pieces 
of Slots and the box in which 
she had been mailed scattered 
fanwise across the gray yard. 
But the head sitting smiling in 
the middle of the scattered pieces 
had a tape for the situation. 
“Butterfingery old cold widower 
and a half-wit moron girl,” it 
said. Then it spent about five 
minutes bouncing up and down 


28 


FANTASTIC 


on the plastic yard sheet and 
screaming, “Shame, shame . . . 
foul, foul . . . save me, save 
me!” After that the head, very 
businesslike, rolled about pick- 
ing up its parts and slotting 
everything together until a pleas- 
ingly tall and slim fair girl of 
metal and white plastic stood 
smiling in the cool rose glow ef 
the pink vapor shield of July. 
“Well, and where’s the bogs?” 
she said as she deftly stooped to 
tear out the white nylo-wov lin- 
ing of the box in which she had 
been mailed. She wrapped the 
long piece of snowy cloth about 
her in such a way that it was 
tastefully full and loose in places 
and taut across other places to 
enhance her fine plastic curves. 
“Always pays to please the bogs,” 
she said. 

“The bogs?” said Little Sister, 
bewildered and still somewhat 
dazed by the performance she 
had just seen. “What do you 
mean, bogs?” 

“The oggosite rex. Like the 
meg for the wogen. — Damn ! 
faulty tape,” she said, making a 
sour face. Then she said with 
a throaty voice and a new clear 
tape, “I mean where are the 
boys? The opposite sex. Like the 
men for the women. I’m a girl !” 
She smiled. 

“You’re to be my little play- 
mate until I’m ready for ‘re- 
placements,’ ” said Little Sister, 
simply and with a heart full of 


love for the warm metal and 
plastic thing towering over her. 
“I’ve got ever so many card-wov 
cut-out dollies. You can have one. 
And two changes of clothes for 
her. Today!” Little Sister’s face 
shone beatific from the beauti- 
ful gesture and the open-hearted 
strain of such hard giving. “And 
I’ll let you color a little with my 
ray spray, if you’ll promise, cross 
your heart, not to bust it.” 

Slots was coldly eyeing Little 
Sister, distaste and boredom 
and pitying amusement in every 
stare. “Aw go grow up,” she said 
gritty voiced with the tape for 
the occasion. “I’m here to play 
with your dad. I think.” Little 
Sister was near to tears. 

But Father, eager as ever, he 
thought, to get the silly diver- 
sions over with, get Little Sister 
back to her place and himself in 
his hip-snuggie chair for more 
formula thinking, had been sci- 
entifically and purposefully read- 
ing the directions, after he had 
recovered from the initial shock 
of hearing Slots talk and seeing 
her put herself together. He re- 
membered that the first of these 
dolls was at least ten years old 
now, and the idea for them was 
much much older, and all this 
helped him regain his confidence 
in the all-rightness of things. 
When he came to the CAUTION 
part of the instructions, he just 
slipped over quickly, caught Slots 
firmly by an arm, took the long 


PLAYMATE 


29 


sections out of her legs and pro- 
ceeded to secure her range- 
change to the place calibrated 
LITTLE - GIRL - PLAYMATE - 
COMPANION. “We ship them 
from our factory on BIG-GIRL- 
LOVEMATE-DIVERSION,” the 
directions stated, “the calibra- 
tion of widest versatility and 
greatest demand. But they func- 
tion quite as well on LITTLE- 
GIRL - PLAYMATE - COM- 
PANION, if wired to it securely 
after first being relieved of the 
long sections of the legs.” And 
Slots, down to Little Sister size 
now, was busily rewinding her 
dress to make up for her new 
status in stature. Then she said, 
a little dully it seemed with the 
tape for the occasion, “Let’s go 
play cut-outs. And really, I'd 
love to use your ray-spray color- 
ing thing, if I may.” 

S O Little Sister and Little Slots 
went arm-in-arm off across 
the gray plastic yard toward Lit- 
tle Sister’s red hut, and Father, 
with the long sections of legs 
tucked firmly under one arm, 


hastened fast as he could back 
to his hip-snuggie chair and his 
big desk for thinking. But just 
as he feared might be the case, 
he found that he was not now 
thinking clean on universal deep 
problems. YES ! he had this other 
problem now that would have to 
be solved before he could get his 
heart out of the bumps and 
jumps and back to universal cool- 
gear smoothness. Oh, why did 
these things have to happen? 
Why couldn’t Little Sister have 
just behaved with Mox, her iron 
man, instead of ordering this 
silly doll playmate? But Father, 
like the dogged fighter he had 
always been, did not dodge the 
issue ; he got right to grips with 
the problem, even if his heart 
was not yet quite as smooth and 
reliable as it should have been. 
Then too he had to work with a 
mind that was really not much 
good now at pertinent flesh-type 
questions, but he would decide. 
YES! — Should he order a doll 
of his own, or just change the 
legs back and forth on this one 
when Little Sister was sleeping?

THE OTHER SIDE 

OF TIME 

By KEITH LAUMER 

Part Two of Three Parts 


Synopsis of Part One 


Brion Bayard, a former Amer- 
ican diplomat, now a colonel in 
the intelligence service of the 
Imperium — the supra-national 
government which rules the Net 
of alternate worlds opened up by 
the development in 1896 of the 
Maxoni-Cocini generator — is 
summoned late one evening to the 
office of his old friend Baron von 
Richthofen, chief of Imperial 
Intelligence. As armed guards 
stand by, Richthofen quizzed 
Bayard closely — on matters of 
Bayard’s personal life and recent 
activities which are well known 
to both parties. 

Satisfied, Richthofen dismiss- 
es the guards, apologizes — but 
offers no explanation. As Bayard 
leaves the building, he sees 
charred footprints in the corri- 
dor, follows them to an unused 
sub-cellar, and there encounters 


a fantastic, glowing figure, 
bending over a fallen man. Bay- 
ard attacks; long pink sparks 
jump from the fiery figure to 
meet him — and a titanic explo- 
sion slams him into unconscious- 
ness. 

He awakens to find himself 
alone, the city deserted — except 
for a lone column of marching 
creatures : non-human, ape-like 
figures in coveralls and helmets. 
He trails them to the Net Ga- 
rages where the alternate-world- 
travelling shuttles are housed; 
discovered, he commandeers an 
alien shuttle parked among the 
Imperial machines — and finds 
himself locked on an automatic 
course for the aliens’ home 
world. 

Arriving in the Hagroon 
world, he is hauled from the ma- 
chine, beaten, marched through 


31 


streets thronged with ape-men 
of a dozen varieties, toiling in 
harness beside mastodgns. He is 
thrust into a cell — where he 
finds Dzok, a representative of 
still another non-human race of 
Anthropos. Dzok, he learns, is an 
agent of the Authority, a super- 
government which, like the Im- 
perium, rules a vast empire of 
alternate worlds. Only the vast- 
ness of the Net — or the Web, as 
Dzok calls the continuum of par- 
allel universes — has prevented 
the two powers from meeting in 
the past. 

They escape together, and in a 
stolen shuttle travel to Dzok’s 
home world, Xonijeel, where, 
Dzok says, Bayard will doubt- 
less receive help in returning to 
the Zero-zero world of the Im- 
perium, and in solving the mys- 
tery of the deserted capital. He 
is given a hearing before a Couvr 
cil of Elders — but instead of 
help, he is condemned to trans- 
portation for life to a sub-tech- 
nical A-line. 

CHAPTER VI 

T WATCHED the play of sun- 
A light on the set of gauzy cur- 
tains at the open window for a 
long time before I began to think 
about who owned them. The rec- 
ollection came hard, like a lesson 
learned but not used for a while. 
I had had a breakdown — a nerv- 
ous collapse, that was it — while 


on a delicate mission to Louisiana 
— the details were vague — and 
now I was resting at a nursing 
home in Harrow, run by kindly 
Mrs. Rogers. . . . 

I sat up, felt a dizziness that 
reminded me of the last time I 
had spend a week flat on my 
back after a difficult surveillance 
job in ... in. ... I had a mo- 
mentary half-recollection of a 
strange city, and many faces, 
and. . . . 

It was gone. I shook my head, 
lay back. I was here for a rest; 
a nice, long rest; then, with my 
pension — a sudden, clear picture 
of my passbook showing a bal- 
ance of 10,000 gold Napoleons on 
deposit at the Banque Credit 
Londres flashed across my mind 
— I could settle somewhere and 
take up gardening, the way I’d 
always wanted to. . . . 

The picture seemed to lack 
something, but it seemed too 
much trouble to think about it 
now. I looked around the room; 
it was small, cheery with sun- 
light and bright-painted furni- 
ture, with hooked rugs on the 
floor and a bedspread decorated 
with a hunting scene that sug- 
gested long winter nights tat- 
ting by an open Are. The door 
was narrow, paneled, brown- 
painted wood, with a bright 
brass knob. The knob turned and 
a buxom woman with grey hair, 
cheeks like apples, a funny little 
hat made of lace, and a many- 


32 


FANTASTIC 


colored skirt that brushed the 
floor came in, gave a jump when 
she saw me, and beamed as 
though I’d just said she made 
apple pie like Mother’s. 

“Mr, Bayard! Ye’re awake!” 
She had a squeaky voice as jolly 
as the whistle on a peanut stand, 
with an accent I couldn’t quite 
place. 

“And hungry, too, I’m guess- 
ing! Ye’d like a lovely bowl of 
soup, now wouldn’t ye, sir? and 
maybe a dab of pudding after.” 

“A nice steak smothered in 
mushrooms sounds better,” I 
said, “And, uh ...” I had 
meant to ask her who she was, 
but then I remembered kindly 
Mrs. Rogers, of course 

“A glass of wine, if it’s avail- 
able,” I finished, and lay back, 
watching little bright spots 
dance before me. 

“Of course; and a nice hot 
bath first. That’ll be lovely, Mr. 
Bayard. I’ll just call Hilda . . .” 
Things were a little hazy then 
for a few minutes ; I was vaguely 
aware of bustlings and the twit- 
ter of feminine voices. Hands 
plucked at me, tugged gently at 
my arms. I made an effort, got 
my eyes open, saw the curve of 
a colored apron over a girlish 
hip. She was leaning across me, 
just getting my pajama jacket 
off. Beyond her, the older woman 
was directing two husky, blonde 
males in maneuvering some- 
thing heavy below my line of 


sight. The girl straightened, and 
I caught a glimpse of a slim 
waist, a nicely rounded bosom 
and arm, a saucy face under 
straight-cut hair the color of 
clover honey. The two men fin- 
ished and left, the motherly type 
with them. The girl fussed for a 
minute, then followed the others, 
leaving the door open. I got up on 
one elbow, saw a six-foot-long 
enamelled bath-tub half full of 
water placed neatly on the oval 
rug, a big fluffy towel, a scrub 
brush, and a square cake of 
white soap on a small stool be- 
side it. It looked inviting. I sat 
up, got my legs over the side of 
the bed, took deep breaths until 
the dizziness went away, then 
pulled off the purple silk pajama 
bottoms and stood, shakily. 

“Oh, ye shouldn’t try to walk 
yet, sir!” a warm contralto voice 
said from the doorway. Honey- 
hair was back, coming toward 
me with a concerned look on her 
pert features. I made a half- 
hearted grab for my pants, al- 
most fell, sat down heavily on 
the bed. She was beside me now, 
with a strong hand under my 
arm. 

“Gunvor and I’ve been worried 
about ye, sir. The doctor said 
ye’d been very sick, but when ye 
slept all day yesterday . . .” 

I wasn’t following what she 
said. It’s one thing to wake up 
in an unfamiliar room and have 
a little trouble getting oriented; 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


33 


it’s considerably different to re- 
alize that you’re among total 
strangers, and that you have no 
recollection at all of how you got 
there. . . . 

W ITH her assistance, I made 
the three steps to the tub, 
hesitated before tackling the 
climb in. 

“Just put your foot in, that’s 
right,” the girl was saying. I fol- 
lowed orders, stepped in and sat 
down, feeling too weak even to 
wince at the hot water. The girl 
perched on the stool beside me, 
tossed her head to get her hair 
back, reached for my arm. 

“I’m Hilda,” she said. “I live 
just along the road. It was excit- 
ing when Gunvor phoned and 
told me about ye’r coming, sir. It 
isn’t often we see a Louisianan 
here; and a diplomat, too. Ye 
must lead the most exciting life ! 
I suppose ye’ve been in Egypt 
and Austria and Spain — and 
even in the Seminole Nation.” 
She chattered and sudsed me, as 
unconcernedly as a grandmoth- 
er bathing a five year old. What 
little impulse to resist I may 
have had faded fast; I was as 
weak as a five-year old, and it 
felt good to have this lively crea- 
ture briskly massaging my back 
with the brush while the sun 
shone through the window and 
the breeze flapped the curtain. 

“. . . ye’re accident, sir?” I 
realized Hilda had asked a ques- 

34 


tion — an awkward one. I had 
a powerful reluctance to admit 
that I had — or appeared to have 
— some sort of mild amnesia. I 
hadn’t forgotten everything, of 
course. It was just that the de- 
tails were hazy. . . . 

“Hilda — ^the man that brought 
me here — did he tell you any- 
thing about me — about the acci- 
dent . . ?” 

“The letter!” Hilda jumped 
up, went across to a table deco- 
rated with red, yellow, blue, and 
orange painted flowers, brought 
back a stiff square envelope. 

“The doctor left this for ye, 
sir. I almost forgot !” 

I reached for it with a wet 
hand, got the flap open, pulled 
out a single sheet of paper on a 
fancy letterhead formally typed : 
“Mr. Bayard, 

It is with deep regret and ex- 
pressions of the highest personal 
regard that I confirm herewith 
your retirement for disability 
from the Diplomatic Service of 
His Imperial Majesty, Napoleon 
Fifth. . . 

There was more — all about my 
faithful service and devotion to 
duty, regrets that I hadn’t re- 
covered in time for a personal 
send-off, and lots of hopes for a 
speedy convalescence. The name 
of a lawyer in Paris was includ- 
ed who would answer all my 
questions, and if at any time he 
could be of assistance, etc, etc. 
The name at the end was un- 


FANTASTIC 


familiar — but then, of course, 
everybody knew Count Regis de 
Manfure, Deputy Foreign Minis- 
ter for Security; good old Reg- 
gie. . . . 

I read the letter twice, then 
folded it and crammed it back 
into the envelope. My hands were 
quivering. 

“Who gave you this?” my 
voice came out hoarse. 

“T’was the doctor, sir. They 
brought ye in the carriage, two 
nights since, and he was most 
particular about ye. A pity about 
ye're friends having to hurry to 
catch the steam-packet for Cal- 
ais — ” 

“What did he look like ?” 

“The doctor?” Hilda resumed 
her scrubbing. “He was a tall 
gentleman, sir ; Handsomely 
dressed, and with a lovely voice. 
Dark, he was, too. But I saw him 
only for a moment or two, and 
in the gloom of the stable-yard I 
couldn’t make out more,” she 
giggled. “But I did mark his eyes 
were close together as two hazel- 
nuts in an egg-cup.” 

“Was he alone?” 

“There was the coachmen, sir 
— and I think another gentlemen 
riding inside, but — ” 

“Did Mrs. Rogers — Gunvor — 
see them?” 

“Only for a few moment, sir. 
They were in a shocking hur- 
ry. . . .” 

Hilda finished with the bath, 
dried me, helped me into clean 


pajamas, helped me stagger back 
to bed and tucked me in. I want- 
ed to ask questions, but sleep 
came down over me like a flood 
from a broken dam. 

T he next time I woke up, I felt 
a little more normal. I got out 
of bed, tottered to the closet, 
found a suit of strange-looking 
clothes with narrow trousers 
and wide lapels, a shirt with 
ruffles at collar and wrist, shoes 
with tiny buckles. 

But of course they weren’t 
really strange, I corrected my- 
self. Very stylish in fact — and 
new, with the tailors tag still in 
the breast pocket. 

I closed the closet, went to the 
window for a look. It was still 
open, and late afternoon sun 
glowing in the potted geraniums 
on the sill. Below was a tidy gar- 
den, a brick walk, a white picket 
fence, and in the distance, a tall- 
open-work church spire. There 
was an odor of fresh-cut hay in 
the air. As I watched, Hilda 
came around the corner with a 
basket in her hand and a shawl 
over her head. She had on a 
heavy, ankle-length skirt and 
wooden shoes painted in red. She 
saw me and smiled up at me. 

“Hello there, sir ! Have you had 
ye’r sleep out, now?” She came 
over, lifted the basket to show 
me a heap of deep red tomatoes. 

“Aren’t they lovely, sir? I’ll 
slice ye some for dinner.” 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


35 


“They look good, Hilda," I 
said. “How long have I been 
asleep?” 

“This last time, sir . . ?” 

“Altogether.” 

“Well, ye came about mid- 
night; after we tucked ye in, ye 
slept all through the next day 
and night, and woke this morn- 
ing about ten. After ye’r bath ye 
went back, and slept till now — ” 

“What time is it?” 

“About five — so that’s an- 
other six hours and more.” She 
laughed. “Ye’ve slept like one 
drugged, sir . . .” 

I felt a weight slide off me 
like thawed snow off a steep 
roof. Drugged! I wasn’t sick — I 
was doped to the eyebrows. 

“I’ve got to talk to Gunvor,” I 
said. “Where is she?” 

“In the kitchen, plucking a 
fine goose for ye’r dinner, sir. 
Shall I tell her — ” 

“No, I’m getting dressed. I’ll 
find her.” 

“Sir, are ye sure ye’re feeling 
well enough.” 

“I’m fine.” I turned back to 
the closet, fighting the drowsi- 
ness that washed around me like 
thick fog, got out the clothes, 
donned underwear, a loose- 
sleeved silk shirt and tight black 
pants of heavy cavalry twill, 
eased my feet into the slippers. 
Out in the narrow, not-quite- 
straight passage papered in 
woodland scenes and decorated 
with framed tintypes, I followed 


the sounds of clattering crock- 
ery, pushed through a swinging 
door into a low-ceilinged, tile- 
floored room with a big black 
coal range, stainless steel sinks 
where a teen-age girl soaped 
dishes before a window with a 
flower-box just outside, a glass- 
paneled door, a display of copper 
pots on the wall, and a big 
scrubbed-looking wooden table 
where Gunvor stood, working 
over the goose. 

“Why, it’s Mr. Bayard!” she 
blew a feather off her nose, look- 
ing flustered. 

I leaned on the table for sup- 
port, trying not to think about 
the buzzing in my head. 

“Gunvor, did the doctor give 
you any medicine for me?” 

“He did indeed, sir; the little 
drops for ye’r soup, and the 
white powders for ye’r other 
dishes — though since ye’ve tak- 
en no solid food as yet — ” 

“No more medicine, Gunvor.” 
Everything was blacking out 
around me; I planted my feet, 
tried to will away the dizziness. 

“Mr. Bayard, ye’re not strong 
enough yet — ye shouldn’t be on 
ye’re feet!” 

“Not . . . going back to bed. 
Need to ... walk,” I got out. 
“Get me outside . . .” 

I felt Gunvor’s arm under 
mine, heard her excited voice; I 
was vaguely aware of stumbling 
up steps, then the coolness of out- 
of-doors. I tried again, drew a 


36 


FANTASTIC 


couple of deep breaths, blinked 
away the fog. 

“Better,” I said. “Just walk 
me. . .” 

Gunvor kept a running string 
of clucks and suggestions that I 
lie down right away; I ignored 
her, kept walking. It was a nice 
garden, with bricked walks curv- 
ing and meandering among the 
vegetable plots, past a rose bed 
along the side, under fruit trees 
at the far end, by a tempting 
bench under a thick-boled oak, 
and back to the kitchen door. 

“Let’s go around again,” I 
tried not to lean on Gunvor this 
time; I was feeling rapidly 
stronger; I could feel faint stir- 
rings of appetite. The sun was 
sinking fast, throwing long, cool 
evening shadows across the 
grass. After the third lap, I 
waited by the kitchen door while 
Gunvor fetched a pitcher from 
the brown wooden ice box and 
poured me a glass of cool cider. 

“Now ye’ll sit and wait for ye’r 
dinner, Mr. Bayard,” Gunvor 
suggested anxiously. 

“I’m all right now,” I patted 
the hand she had laid on my arm. 

S HE watched me anxiously as I 
started off. I breathed deep 
and tried to sort out my thoughts. 
Someone had brought me here, 
drugged, arranged to keep me 
that way — for how long I didn’t 
know, but I could check that by 
examining Gunvor’s medicine 


supply. Someone had also been 
tinkering with my memory; the 
question of who — and why — 
needed answering. 

I made an effort to cut through 
the fog, place an authentic recol- 
lection. It was June here, I 
judged, from the tender leaves 
and the budding roses. Where 
Had I been in May, or last win- 
ter. . . ? 

Icy streets, tall buildings grim 
in the winter night, but inside, 
warmth, cheer, color, the laugh- 
ing faces of friendly people and 
the smile of a beautiful red-head, 
named . . . named . . . 

I couldn’t remember. The al- 
most-recollection slipped away 
like a wisp of smoke in a sudden 
breeze. Someone had done a good 
job, using deep hypnotics, no 
doubt, of burying my recollec- 
tions under a layer of false mem- 
ories. Still, they hadn’t done as 
well as they thought ; it had 
taken me only a few hours to 
throw off the nebulous impres- 
sions of a dubious past. Per- 
haps — 

I turned, hurried back to the 
house. Gunvor was hesitating 
over a plate of fresh-baked pas- 
tries; she ducked something un- 
der her apron as I stepped into 
the room. 

“Oh! Ye startled me, sir . . .” 

I went across and removed a 
salt-shaker half filled with a 
coarse white powder from her 
hand, tossed it into the basket. 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


37 


“No more medicine, I said, 
Gunvor.” I patted her reassur- 
ingly. “I know the doctor gave 
you instructions, but I don’t need 
it any more. But tell me: is there 
a ...” I groped for a word; I 
didn’t want to alarm her by ask- 
ing for a brain doctor, and she 
wouldn’t understand ‘psychia- 
trist’. "A hypnotist?” I waited 
for signs of comprehension. 
“Someone who talks to troubled 
people, soothes them — ” 

“Ah, Ye mean a mesmerist! 
But there’s none here in the vil- 
lage, alas ; only Mother Good- 
will,” she added doubtfully. 

“Mother Goodwill?” I prompt- 
ed. 

“I’ve nothing against her, 
mind ye, sir — but there’s those 
that talk of witchcraft. And I 
was reading just the other day in 
the Paris Match that ye can de- 
velop serious neuroses by letting 
unqualified practitioners meddle 
with ye’r psyche.” 

“You’re so right, Gunvor,” I 
agreed. “But it’s only a little 
matter of a faulty memory — ” 

“Are ye troubled with that too, 
sir?” her face lit up. “I’m that 
forgetful meself, sometimes I 
think I should have something 
done — but then a regular mes- 
merist’s so dear, and as for these 
quacks — ” 

“What about Mother Goodwill ? 
Does she live near here ?” 

“At the other end of the vil- 
lage, sir. But I wouldn’t recom- 

38 


mend her — not for a cultured 
gentlemen like ye’rself. Her cot- 
tage is very plain, and the old 
woman herself is something less 
than a credit to our village. 
Dowdy, she is, sir — no sense of 
style at all. And as for clothes — ” 
“I won’t be overly critical, 
Gunvor. Will you take me to 
her?” 

“I’ll summon her here, sir, if 
ye’re determined — but there’s a 
licensed master mesmerist in 
Ealing, just an hour by coach — ” 
“Mother Goodwill will do, I 
think. How soon can you get her 
here?” 

“I'll send Ingalill — but if it’s 
all the same to ye, sir, let me have 
her up after dinner; I’ve just 
popped me goose in, and the pies 
are browning even now — 

“After dinner will be fine. I’ll 
take a few more turns around the 
garden and develop an appetite 
worthy of your cooking.” 

A fter a second slab of black- 
berry pie buried in cream too 
thick to pour, a final mug of 
ground-at-the-table coffee, and 
with a healthy snort of brandy 
with the flavor of a century in a 
dark cellar safely under my belt, 
I lit up a New Orleans cigar and 
watched as Hilda and Gunvor lit 
the oil lamps in the sitting room. 
There was a timid tap at the 
door, and Ingalill, the kitchen 
slavey, poked her face in. 

“The old witch is here,” she 


FANTASTIC 


piped. “Gunvor, she’s smoking a 
pipe. I think it’s got ground up 
salamander innards in it — ” 

“She’ll hear ye, ye wretch,” 
Hilda said. “Tell her to wait until 
her betters summon her — ” 

Ingalill yelped and jumped 
aside, and a bent-backed ancient 
in a poke bonnet pushed in past 
her, one gnarled hand gripping 
a crooked stick on which she 
leaned. Bright black eyes darted 
about the room, lit on me. I 
stared back, taking in the warty 
nose, toothless gums, out-thrust 
chin, and wisp of white hair 
hanging beside one hollow cheek. 
I didn’t see a pipe, but as I 
watched she snorted a last wisp 
of smoke from her nostrils. 

“Who has need of Mother 
Goodwill’s healing touch?” she 
quavered. “But of course, it’d be 
you, sir, who’ve come such a 
strange, long way, and with 
a stranger, longer path still 
ahead . . .” 

“Phooie, I told you it was the 
new gentleman,” Ingalill said. 
“What’s in the basket?” she 
reached to lift a corner of the red 
and white checked cloth covering 
the container, yelped as the stick 
cracked across her knuckles. 

“Mind ye’r manners, dearie,” 
Mother Goodwill said sweetly. 
She shuffled to a chair, sank 
down, put the basket on the floor 
at her feet. 

“Now, Mother Goodwill,” Gun- 
vor said, sounding agitated. “The 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


gentleman only wants a little 
help with — ” 

“He’d draw aside the veil of 
the past, the future to read more 
clearly,” the crone piped. “Ah, he 
did well to call on old Mother Gee. 
Now . . .” her tone became more 
brisk. “If ye’ll pour me a dram, 
Gunvor, to restore me strength a 
mite — and then ye’ll all have to 
clear out — except m’lord the 
new gentleman, o’ course.” She 
grinned at me like a meat-eating 
bird. 

“I’m not interested in the fu- 
ture,” I started — 

“Are ye not, sir?” the old 
woman nodded as though agree- 
ing. “Then it’s a strange mortal 
ye are — ” 

“. . . but there are some things 
I need to remember,” I bored on, 
ignoring the sales pitch. “Maybe 
under light hypnosis I can — ” 

“So . . . Then it’s the past ye’d 
glimpse, as I thought,” she com- 
mented imperturbably. Gunvor 
was clicking glasses at the side- 
board. She came over and handed 
the old woman a glass, then got 
busy clearing dishes from the ta- 
ble, with Ingalill and Hilda work- 
ing silently beside her. 

Mother Goodwill smacked her 
lips over the brandy, then 
waved an over-sized brown-spot- 
ted hand. 

“Away with ye, now me 
chicks !” she quavered. “I feel the 
spirit coming over me. The pow- 
er’s flowing in the celestial field- 

39 


coil! Strange visions are stir- 
ring, like phantom vipers in a 
pot! What’s this? What’s this? 
Ai, curious indeed, the things the 
spirits whisper to me now . . 

“Hummp! Ye can skip the 
spirits routine,” Hilda said. “All 
Mr. Bayard wants from ye — ” 
“Get along with ye, girl,” the 
old woman snapped, “Or I’ll send 
a cramp that’ll lock ye’re knees 
together that tight the fairest 
swain this side o’ Baghdad’ll not 
unlock ’em ! All of ye ! Off, now I” 

T hey went. Then the hag 
turned to me. 

“Now, down to business, sir,” 
she used a wheedling tone. “What 
were ye thinking of giving the 
old woman for a handful of lost 
recollections? Is it a lover ye’ve 
forgot, the raptures of youth, the 
key to happiness once glimpsed 
and now forever gone a-glimmer- 
ing . . , ?” 

I was grinning at her. “You’ll 
be well paid; but let’s skip the 
rest of the routine. I’ll get 
straight to the point : I have rea- 
son to believe I’m suffering from 
induced amnesia, probably the 
result of post-hypnotic sugges- 
tion. I’d like you to put me un- 
der and see if you counter the 
block.” 

Mother Goodwill leaned for- 
ward, looked at me keenly, 
“There’s a strangeness about 
ye — something I can’t put me fin- 
ger on; it’s as though ye’r eyes 


were focussed on a horizon that 
other men can’t see , . 

“Granted ; I’m a strange char- 
acter. But not so strange you 
can’t hypnotize — or mesmerize 
me, I hope.” 

“Ye say ye’ve been tampered 
with, ye’r memories taken from 
ye; who’d’ve done a thing like 
that to ye, lad — and why ?” 

“Maybe if you’re successful. 
I’ll find out.” 

She nodded briskly, “I’ve 
heard of such things; spells of 
darkness, cast by the light of a 
blood-red moon — ” 

“Mother GoodwiU,” I cut in. 
“Let’s get one thing straight: 
every time you mention spells, 
magic, dark powers, or greases, 
the fee goes down. I’m interested 
in straight scientific mesmerism. 
OK?” 

“What, good sir ? Would ye tell 
the Mistress of Darkness how to 
ply her trade?” 

The routine was beginning to 
get tiresome. “Maybe we’d bet- 
ter forget the whole thing.” I 
reached in my pocket for a coin. 
“My mistake. . .” 

“Are ye saying Mother Good- 
will’s a fraud, then?” her voice 
had taken on a suspiciously mild 
note. I looked at her, caught a 
glint of light from an eye as 
black and bright as a polished 
opal. “D’ye think the old woman’s 
out to trick ye, to play ye false, to 
gull ye fer a new fledged chick, 
to . . .” her voice droned on.

FANTASTIC 


coming from far away now, 
booming like surf in a sea-cave, 
echoing, echoing . . , 

. .ten!” 

My eyes snapped open. A 
woman with a pale, almost — 
beautiful face sat, leaning pen- 
sively on one elbow, a cigarette in 
her hand, watching me. Her dark 
hair was done up in a tight bun; 
her plain white blouse was open 
at the collar, showing a strong, 
graceful neck. There was one 
dark curl against her forehead. 

I looked around the room; it 
was dark outside now; a clock 
was ticking loudly somewhere. 

“What happened to the old bel- 
dame?” I blurted. 

The woman smiled faintly, 
waved a well-manicured hand to- 
ward a black cape on the chair 
beside her, a gnarled stick lean- 
ing again it. 

“Rather warm for working in. 
How are you feeling?” 

I considered. “Fine. But — ” I 
caught a glimpse of a wisp of 
stringy grey hair under the edge 
of the cloak. I got out of my chair, 
went over and lifted it ; there was 
a warty rubber mask, a pair of 
gnarly gloves. 

“What’s the idea of the get- 
up?” 

“I find it helpful in my . . . 
business. Now — ” 

“You fooled me, in a bad light, 
I said, “I take it Gunvor and the 
others are in on the gag ?” 


She shook her head. “No one 
ever sees me in a good light, Mr. 
Bayard — and no one wishes to 
approach too close, even then. 
They’re simple people here 
abouts; in their thoughts warts 
and wisdom go together — so I 
sedk to fit their image of a village 
mesmerist, else none would seek 
my skill. You’re the only one who 
shares my little secret.” 

“Why me?” 

She looked at me searchingly. 
“You are a most unusual man, 
Mr. Bayard. A true man of mys- 
tery. You talked to me — of many 
things. Strange things. Things 
at which the mind reels. You 
spoke of other worlds, like this 
our own familiar plane, but dif- 
ferent, alien. You talked of men 
like animals, clothed in shaggy 
hair — ” 

“Dzok!” I burst out. My hands 
went to my head as though to 
squeeze the recollections from my 
brain like toothpaste from a tube. 
“The Hagroon, and — ” 

“Calmly, calmly, Mr. Bayard,” 
the woman soothed. “Your mem- 
ories — if true memories they are, 
and not fever-fancies — are there, 
intact, ready to be recalled. Rest, 
now. It was not easy for either of 
us, this stripping away of veils 
from your mind. A master mes- 
merist indeed was he who sought 
to bury your visions of strange 
paradises and unthinkable hells 
— but all lies exposed now.” I 
looked at her and she smiled. 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


41 


“I am no journeyman practi- 
tioner myself,” she murmured. 
“But all my skill was challenged 
this night.” She rose, went to a 
framed mirror on the wall, grace- 
fully tucked back a strand of 
hair. I watched her without see- 
ing her ; thoughts of Barbro, the 
flaming figure in the dark store- 
room, the escape with Dzok 
from the Hagroon cell were jos- 
tling each other, clamoring to 
be remembered, thought about, 
evaluated. 

Mother Goodwill plucked her 
cape from the chair, swirled it 
about her shoulders, hunching 
into the posture of the hag she 
had been. Her white hands 
slipped the mask in place, fitting 
it to her nose and mouth. The 
gloves and wig followed, and now 
the bright eyes gazed at me from 
the wrinkled face of age. 

“Rest, sir,” the ancient face 
cackled. “Rest, sleep, dream, and 
let those restless thoughts seek 
out and know their familiar 
places once again. I’ll attend ye 
on the morrow — there’s more 
that Mother Goodwill would learn 
of the universes ye’ve told me 
lurk beyond the threshold of the 
drab world.” 

“Wait,” I said. “I haven’t paid 
you. . .” 

She waved a veined hand. 
“Ye’ve paid me well in the stuff 
visions are wrought on, sir. 
Sleep, I say — and awake re- 
freshed, strong, with your wits 


keened to razor’s edge. For ye’ll 
be needing all yer strength to 
face what waits ye in the days yet 
undawned.” 

She went out then ; I went 
along the hall to my dark room, 
threw my clothes on a chair, fell 
into the feather-mattressed bed, 
and sank down into troubled 
dreams. 

CHAPTER VII 

TT was three days before I felt 

strong enough to pay my call 
on Mother Goodwill. Her cottage 
was a thatch-roofed rectangle of 
weathered whitewash almost lost 
under a tangle of wrist-sized rose 
vines heavy with deep red blos- 
soms. I squeezed through a 
rusted gate, picked my way along 
a path over-hung with untrimmed 
rhododendron, lifted the huge 
brass knocker, clanked it against 
the low black oak door. Through 
the one small, many-paned win- 
dow, I caught a glimpse of the 
corner of a table, a pot of forget- 
me-nots, a thick leather-bound 
book. There was a humming of 
bees in the air, a scent of flowers, 
and a whiff of fresh-brewed cof- 
fee. Certainly not the traditional 
setting for calling on a witch, I 
thought. . . . 

The door opened. Mother Good- 
will looking neat in a white shirt 
and peasant skirt, favored me 
with a sad smile, motioning me 
in.

“No Halloween costume to- 
day,” I commented. 

“You’re feeling better, Mr. 
Bayard,” she said drily. “Will 
you have a mug of coffee? Or 
isn’t it customary in your native 
land?” 

I shot her a sharp look. “Skep- 
tical already?” 

Her shoulders lifted and 
dropped. “I believe what my 
senses tell me. Sometimes they 
seem to contradict each the 
other.” I took a chair at the table, 
glanced around the small room. It 
was scrupulously clean and tidy, 
furnished with the kind of rustic 
authenticity that would have had 
the ladies of the DAR back home 
oohing and ahing and overwork- 
ing the word ‘quaint’. Mother 
Goodwill brought the pot over, 
poured two cups, put cream and 
sugar on the table, then sat. 

“Well, Mr. Bayard, is your 
mind clear this morning, your re- 
membrance well restored ?” 

I nodded, tried the coffee. It 
was good. 

“Don’t you have some other 
name I could call you?” I asked. 
“Mother Goodwill goes with the 
fright wig and the warts.” 

“You may call me Olyvia.” She 
had slim, white hands, and on one 
finger a fine green stone twinkled. 
She sipped her coffee and looked 
at me, as though making up her 
mind to tell me something. 

“You were going to ask me a 
question,” I prompted her. “After 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


I’ve answered them, maybe you’ll 
clear up a few matters for me.” 

“Many were the wonders you 
babbled of in your delerium,” 
she said. I heard a tiny clatter, 
glanced at her cup ; a fine tremor 
was rattling it against the sau- 
cer. She put it down quickly, 
ducked her hands out of sight. 

“Oft have I sensed that there 
was more to existence than 
this . . .” she waved a hand to 
take in everything. “In dreams 
I’ve glimpsed enchanted hills and 
my heart yearned out to them, 
and I’d wake with the pain of 
something beautiful and lost that 
haunted me long after. I think in 
your wild talk, there was that 
which made a certain hope spring 
up again — a hope long forgotten, 
with the other hopes of youth. 
Now tell me stranger: that talk 
of other worlds, like each to other 
as new-struck silver pieces, yet 
each with a tiny diffei-ence — and 
of a strange coach, with the 
power to fly from one to the next 
— all this was fancy, eh ? The rav- 
ing of a mind sore vexed with 
meddling — ” 

“It’s true — Olywia,” I cut in. “I 
know it’s hard to grasp at first ; I 
seem to recall I was a bit difficult 
to convince once. We’re accus- 
tomed to thinking we know every- 
thing; there’s a powerful ten- 
dency to disbelieve anything that 
doesn’t fit the preconception.” 

“You spoke of trouble, 
Brion . . she spoke my name 

43 


easily, familiarly; I suppose 
sharing someone’s innermost 
thoughts tends to relax formali- 
ties. I didn’t mind ; Olyvia with- 
out her disguise was a charming 
woman, in spite of her severe 
hairdo and prison pallor. With a 
little sunshine and just a touch 
of make-up — 

I pulled myself back to the sub- 
ject at hand. 

S HE listened attentively as I 
told her the whole story, from 
Richthofen’s strange interroga- 
tion to my sentencing by the Xoni- 
jeelians. 

“So I’m stuck,” I finished. 
“Without a shuttle, I’m trapped 
here for the rest of my days.” 

She shook her head. “Th^e are 
strange things, Brion, things I 
should not believe, so wild and 
fantastic are they. And yet — I do 
believe. . . 

“From what little I’ve learned 
of this world-line, it’s backward 
technologically — ” 

“Why, we’re a very modern 
people,” Olyvia said defensively. 
“We have steam power — the 
ships on the Atlantic run make 
the crossing in nine days — and 
there are the balloons, the tele- 
graph, and telephone, our modern 
coal-burning road cars which are 
beginning to replace the horse 
in many parts of the colonies 
even — ” 

“Sure, I know, Olyvia — no of- 
fense intended. Let’s just say 

44 


that in some areas we’re ahead of 
you. The Imperium has the M-C 
drive; my own native world has 
nuclear power, jet aircraft, radar 
and a primitive space program. 
Here you’ve gone in other direc- 
tions. The point is, I’m stranded 
here. They’ve exiled me to a con- 
tinuum I can never escape from.” 

“Is it so ill then, Brion? You 
have a whole world here before 
you — and now that the artificial 
barriers have been cleansed from 
your mind, you’ll freely recall 
these wonders you left behind!” 
She was speaking eagerly now, 
excited at the prospect. “You 
spoke of aircraft ; build one ! how 
marvelous to fly in the sky like 
a bird! Your coming here could 
mean the dawn of a new Age of 
Glory for the Empire !” 

“Uh-hun,” I said ungraciously. 
“That’s great. But what about 
MY world? By now the Hagroon 
have probably launched their at- 
tack — and maybe succeeded with 
it! My wife may be wearing 
chains now instead of pearls!” I 
got up, stamped over to the win- 
dow and stared out. “While I rot 
here, in this back-water world.” 

“Brion,” she said softly behind 
me. “You find yourself troubled 
— not so much by the threat to 
your beloved friends as by the 
quality of remoteness these mat- 
ters have taken on . , .” 

I turned. “What do you mean, 
remote? Barbro, my friends, in 
the hands of these ape-men — ” 


FANTASTIC 


“Those who tampered with 
your mind, Brion, sought to erase 
these things from your memory. 
True, my skill availed to lift the 
curse — but ’tis no wonder that 
they seem to you now as old mem- 
ories, a tale told long ago. And I 
myself gave a command to you 
while yet you slept, that the pain 
of loss be eased — ” 

“The pain of loss be damned! 
If I hadn’t been fool enough to 
trust Dzok — ’’ 

“Poor Brion. Know you not yet 
it was he who gulled you while 
you slept, planted the desire to go 
with him to Xonijeel? Yet he did 
his best for you or so your mem- 
ory tells.” 

“I could have taken the shuttle 
back,” I said flatly. “At least I’d 
have been there, to help fight 
them off.” 

“And yet, the wise ones, the 
monkey-men of Xonijeel, told 
that this Zero-zero world did not 
exist — ” 

“They’re crazy!” I took a turn 
up and down the room. “There’s 
too much here I don’t under- 
stand, Olyvia! I’m like a man 
wandering in the dark, banging 
into things that he can’t quite 
get his hands on. And now — ” 
I raised my hands and let 
them fall, suddenly inexpressibly 
weary. 

“You have your life still ahead, 
Brion. You will make a new place 
for yourself here. Accept that 
which cannot be changed.” 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


T CAME back and sat down. 
A “Olyvia, I haven’t asked Gun- 
vor and the others many ques- 
tions; I didn’t want to arouse 
curiosity by my ignorance. The 
indoctrination Dzok and his boys 
gave me didn’t cover much — just 
enough to get me started. I sup- 
pose they figured I’d get to a li- 
brary and brief myself. Tell me 
something about this world; fill 
me in on your history, to start 
with.” 

She laughed — an unexpectedly 
merry sound. 

“How charming, Brion — to be 
called upon to describe this hum- 
drum old world as though it were 
a dreamer’s fancy — a might-have- 
been, instead of dull reality.” 

I managed a sour smile. “Real- 
ity’s always a little dull to who- 
ever’s involved in it.” 

“Where shall I begin? With 
ancient Rome? The Middle 
Ages?” 

“The first thing to do is esta- 
blish a Common History date; 
the point at which your world’s 
history diverged from mine’s. 
You mentioned ‘The Empire’. 
What empire? When was it 
founded?” 

“Why, the Empire of France, 
of course . . .” Olyvia blinked, 
then shook her head. “But then, 
nothing is ‘of course’,” she said. 
“I speak of the Empire estab- 
blished by Bonaparte, in 1799.” 

“So far so good,” I said. “We 
had a Bonaparte, too. But his em- 

45 


pire didn’t last long. He abdi- 
cated and was sent off to Elba in 
1814—” 

“Yes — but he escaped, return- 
ed to France, and led his armies 
to glorious victory !” 

I was shaking my head. “He 
was free for a hundred days, 
until the British defeated him at 
Waterloo. He was sent to St. Hel- 
ena and died a few years later.” 

Olyvia stared at me. “How 
strange . . . how eerie, and how 
strange. The Emperor Napoleon 
ruled in ^splendor at Paris for 
twenty-three years after his 
great victory at Brussels, and 
died in 1837 at Nice. He was suc- 
ceeded by his son, Louis — ” 

“The Duke of Reichstadt?” 

“No; the Duke died in his 
youth, of consumption. Louis was 
a boy of sixteen, the son of the 
Emperor and the Princess of 
Denmark.” 

“And his Empire still exists,” 
I mused. 

“After the abdication of the 
English tyrant, George, the Brit- 
ish Isles were permitted to enter 
the Empire as a special ward of 
the Emperor. After the unifica- 
tion of Europe, enlightenment 
was brought to the Asians and 
Africans; today, they are semi- 
autonomous provinces, adminis- 
tered from Paris, but with their 
own local Houses of Deputies em- 
powered to deal with internal 
matters. As for New France — or 
Louisiana — this talk of rebellion 


will soon die down; a royal com- 
mission has been sent to look into 
the complaints against the Vice- 
roy.” 

“I think we’ve got the C. H. 
date pretty well pinned down,” I 
said. “Eighteen-fourteen ; and it 
looks as though there’s been no 
significant scientific or techno- 
logical progress since.” 

T his prompted questions which 
I answered at length. Olyvia 
was an intelligent and well-edu- 
cated woman ; she was enthralled 
by my picture of a world without 
the giant shadow of Bonaparte 
dominating it. 

The morning had developed 
into the drowsy warmth of noon 
by the time I finished. Olyvia of- 
fered me lunch and I accepted. 
While she busied herself at the 
wood-burning stove, I sat by the 
window, sipping a stone mug of 
brown beer, looking out at this 
curious, anachronistic landscape 
of tilled fields, a black-topped 
road along which a horse pulled a 
rubber-tired carriage, the white 
and red dots of farmhouses 
across the valley. There was an 
air of peace and plenty that made 
my oddly distant recollection of 
the threat to the Imperium seem, 
as Olyvia said, like a half -forgot- 
ten story, read long ago — like 
something in the book lying on 
the table. I picked up the fat, red 
leather bound volume glanced at 
the title : 


46 


FANTASTIC 


THE SORCERESS OF OZ by 
Lyman F. Baum. 

“That’s funny,” I said. 

Olyvia glanced over at the book 
in my hands, smiled almost 
shyly. 

“Strange reading matter for a 
witch, you think? But on these 
fancies my own dreams some- 
times love to dwell, Brion. As I 
told you, this one narrow world 
seems not enough — ” 

“It’s not that, Olyvia ; but 
we’ve pretty well established that 
our C. H. date is early in the 
nineteenth century — but Baum 
wasn’t born until about 1865 or 
so — nearly half a century later. 
But here he is . . 

I flipped the book open, noted 
the publisher — Wiley & Cotton, 
New York, New Orleans, and 
Paris — and the date : 1896. 

“You know this book, in your 
own strange world?” Olyvia 
asked. 

I shook my head. “In my world 
he never wrote this one ...” I 
was admiring a frontispiece by 
W. W. Denslow, showing a 
Glinda-like figure facing a group 
of Gnomes. The next page had 
an elaborate initial T’ at the top, 
followed by the words : 

“. . . summoned you here,” 
said Sorana the Sorceress, “to 
tell you . . .” 

“It was my favorite book, as a 
child,” Olyvia said. “But if you 
know it not, how then do you 
recognize the author’s name?” 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


“He wrote others. The Wizard 
of Oz was the first book I ever 
read all the way through.” 

“The Wizard of Oz? Not the 
Sorceress? How enchanting it 
would be to read it !” 

“Is this the only one he 
wrote ?” 

“Sadly, yes. He died the fol- 
lowing year — 1897.” 

“1897, that could mean . . 

I trailed off. The fog that had 
been hanging over my mind for 
the days since I had awakened 
here was rapidly dissipating in 
the brisk wind of a sudden reali- 
zation : Dzok and his friends had 
relocated me, complete with 
phony memories to replace the 
ones they’d tried to erase, in a 
world-line as close as possible to 
my own. They’d been clever, 
thorough, and humane — but not 
quite as clever as they thought, a 
bit less thorough in their re- 
search than they should have 
been — and altogether too hu- 
mane. I remembered the photo- 
diagram the Councillors had 
shown me — and the glowing 
point, unknown to Imperial Net 
cartographers, which represent- 
ed a fourth, undiscovered world 
lying within the Blight. I had 
thought at the time that it was 
an error, along with the other, 
greater error that had omitted 
the zero-zero line of the Imper- 
ium — 

But it had been no mistake. 
B-1 Four existed — a world with 

47 


a Common History date far more 
recent than the 15th century — 
the C. H. date of the closest lines 
beyond the Blight. 

And I was there — or here — in 
a world where, in 1897 at least 
one man known in my own world 
had existed. And if one, why not 
another — or two others: Maxoni 
and Cocini, inventors of the M-C 
drive. . . . 

C OULD mean what, Brion?” 

Olyvia’s voice jarred me back 
to the present. 

“Nothing. Just a thought.” I 
put the book down. “I suppose 
it’s only natural that even fifty 
years after a major divergence, 
not everything would have been 
affected. Some of the same peo- 
ple would be born. . . 

“Brion,” Olyvia looked at me 
across the room. “I won’t ask 
you to trust me ; but let me help 
you.” 

“Help me with what?” I tried 
to recapture the casual expres- 
sion I’d been wearing up until a 
moment before, but I could feel it 
freezing on my face like a mud 
pack. 

“You have made a plan; I 
sense it. Alone, you cannot suc- 
ceed. There is too much that is 
strange to you here, too many 
pitfalls to betray you. Let me 
lend you what help I can.” 

“Why should you want to help 
me — if I were planning some- 
thing?” 

48 


She looked at me for a minute 
without answering, her dark 
eyes wide in her pale, classic 
face. 

“I’ve spent my life in search 
for a key to some other world . . 
some dream-world of my mind. 
Somehow, you seem to be a link, 
Brion. Even if I can never go 
there, it would please me to know 
I’d helped someone to reach the 
unattainable shore.” 

“They’re all worlds, just like 
this one, Olyvia. Some better, 
some worse — some much, much 
worse. They’re all made up of 
people and earth and buildings, 
the same old natural laws, the 
same old human nature. You 
can’t find your dream-world by 
packing up and moving on ; 
you’ve got to build it where you 
are.” 

“And yet — I see the ignorance, 
the corruption, the social and 
moral decay, the lies, the cheats, 
the treachery of those who hold 
the trust of the innocent — ” 

“Sure — and until we’ve 
evolved a human society to match 
our human intelligence, those 
things will exist. But give us 
time Olyvia — we’ve only been ex- 
perimenting with culture for a 
few thousand years. A few thou- 
sand more will make a lot of dif- 
ference.” 

She laughed. “You speak as 
though an age were but a mo- 
ment.” 

“Compared with the time it 
FANTASTIC 


took us to evolve from an amoeba 
to an ape — or even from the first 
Homo Sapiens to the first tilled 
field — it 18 a moment. But don’t 
give up your dreams ; they’re the 
force that carries us on toward 
whatever our ultimate goal is.” 

‘‘Then let me lend that dream 
concrete reality. Let me help you, 
Brion. The story they told me — 
that you had fallen ill from over- 
work as an otficial of the Im- 
perial Colonial Office, that you 
were here for a rest cure — ’tis as 
thin as a Parisian night-dress! 
And Brion . . .” She lowered her 
voice. ‘‘You are watched.” 

“Watched? By who — a little 
man with a beard and dark 
glasses ?” 

“ ’Tis no jest, Brion ! I saw a 
man last night lurking by the 
gate at Gunvor’s house — and 
half an hour since, a man well 
muffled up in scarves passed in 
the road yonder, as you supped 
coffee.” 

“That doesn’t prove anything.” 

She shook her head impatient- 
ly. “You plan to fly; I know that. 
I know also that your visit to me 
will arouse the curiosity of those 
who prison you here — ” 

“Prison me? Why, I’m as free 
as a bird — ” 

“You waste time, Brion,” she 
cut me off. “What deed you com- 
mitted, or why, I know not; but 
in a contest between you and 
drab officialdom. I’ll support your 
cause. Now, quickly, Brion! 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


Where will you go? How will you 
travel ? What plan will — ” 

“Hold on, Olyvia! You’re 
jumping to conclusions !” 

“And jump you must, if you’d 
evade the hounds of the hunter! 
I sense danger, closing about you 
as a snare about the roebuck’s 
neck!” 

“I’ve told you, Olyvia — I was 
exiled here by the Xonijeelian 
Council; they didn’t believe my 
story — or pretended not to. They 
dumped me here to be rid of me 
— they fancy themselves as hu- 
mane, you know. If they’d meant 
to kill me, they had every oppor- 
tunity to do so — ” 

“They sought to mesmerize 
your knowledge of the past 
away ; now they watch, their re- 
sults to judge. And when they 
see you restive, familiar of a 
witch—” 

“You’re no witch — ” 

“As such all know me here. 
’Twas an ill gambit that brought 
you here by daylight, Brion — ” 
“If I’d crept out at midnight, 
they’d have seen me anyway — 
if they’re watching me as you 
seem to think — and they’d have 
known damned well I wasn’t sat- 
isfied with their hand-painted 
picture of my past.” 

“At any case, they’ll like it not. 
They’ll come again, take you 
away, and once again essay to 
numb your knowledge of the 
worlds, and of your past.” 

I thought that over. “They 

49 


might, at that,” I said. “I don’t 
suppose it was any part of their 
relocation program to have me 
spreading technical knowledge 
among the primitives.” 

“Where will you go, Brion?” 

I hesitated ; but what the hell, 
Olyvia was right; I had to have 
help. And if she intended to be- 
tray me, she had plenty on me 
already. 

“Rome,” I said. 

She nodded. “Very well. How 
is the state of your purse ?” 

“I have a bank account — ” 

“Leave that. Luckily, I have 
my store of gold Napoleons bur- 
ied in the Garden.” 

“I don’t want your money — ” 

“Nonsense. We’ll both need it. 
I’m going with you.” 

“You can’t—” 

“Can, and will!” she said, her 
dark eyes alight, “Make ready, 
Brion! We leave this very 
night!” 

'y'HIS is crazy," I whispered to 
■*- the dark, hooded figure stand- 
ing beside me on the shadowed 
path. “There’s no reason for you 
to get involved in this . . .” 

“Hush,” Olyvia said softly. 
“Now he grows restless. See him 
there? I think he’ll cross the road 
now, more closely to spy us out.” 

I watched the dense shadows, 
made out the figure of a man ; he 
moved off, crossed the road a 
hundred yards below the cottage, 
disappeared among the trees on 


our side. I shifted my weight 
carefully, itching under the wild 
get-up Oylvia had assembled for 
me — ^warty face, gnarly hands, 
stringy white hair, and all. I 
looked like Mother Goodwill’s 
older brother — as ill-tempered an 
old duffer as ever gnashed his 
gums at the carryings-on of the 
younger generation. Olyvia was 
done up like Belle Watling in 
three layers of paint, a fancy red 
wig, a purple dress that fit her 
trim figure like wet silk, and 
enough rings, beads and tinkly 
earring to stock a gift shop. 

“Hist— he steals closer now,” 
my co-conspirator whispered. 
“Another half minute . . .” 

I waited, listening to the mo- 
notonous chirrup of crickets in a 
near-by field, the far-away 
oo-mau of a cow, the yapping of 
a farm dog. After dark, the 
world belonged to the animals. 

Olyvia’s hand touched mine. 
“Now ...” I followed as she 
stepped silently off ; I had to 
crouch slightly to keep below the 
level of the ragged hedge. There 
was no moon; only a little faint 
star-light to help us pick a way 
along the rutted dirt road. We 
reached the end of the hedge, 
and I motioned Olyvia back, stole 
a look back toward the house. A 
head was clearly silhouetted 
against the faint light from the 
small side windaw. 

“It’s OK,” I said in a low 
voice, “He’s at the window — ” 


50 


FANTASTIC 


There was a crunch of gravel, 
and a light snapped on, played 
across the ruts, flashed over me, 
settled on Olyvia, 

“Here, woman,” a deep voice 
growled. “What’re ye doing 
abroad after Bell-toll ?” 

Olyvia planted a hand on her 
hip, to.ssed her head, not neglect- 
ing to smile archly. 

“Aoow, Capting,” she purred. 
“Ye fair give me a turn ! It’s only 
me old gaffer, what oi’m seein 
orf to the rile-trine.” 

“Gaffer, is it?” The light dwelt 
on me again briefly, went back 
to caress Olyvia’s sequinned bos- 
om. “Haven’t seen ye about the 
village before. Where ye from?” 

“I float about, as ye might say, 
Major. A tourist, like, ye might 
call me — ” 

"On shank’s mare, in the mid- 
dle of the night? Queer idea o’ 
fun, I call it — and with yer 
gaffer, too. Better let me see yer 
identity papers, ducks.” 

“Well, as it ’appens, I come 
away in such a rush, they seem 
to ave got left behind . . .” 

“Like that, is it?” I heard a 
snort from the unseen man be- 
hind the light — one of the roving 
security police who were a fix- 
ture of this world, I guessed. 
“Run off with a fistful o’ spoons, 
did ye? Or maybe lifted one 
purse too many — ” 

“Nofink o’ that sort! What 
cheek! I’m an honest, licensed 
tart, plying ’er profession and 


keeping her old gaffer, what oi’m 
the sole support of !” 

“Never mind, love; I won’t 
take ye in. A wee sample of yer 
wares, and I’ll forget I ever saw 
ye.” He came close, and a big 
hand reached out toward Oljrvia. 
She let out a short squeak and 
jumped back. The cop brushed 
past me ; I caught a glimpse of a 
tricorn hat, a beak nose, loose 
jowls, a splash of color on the 
collar of the uniform; I picked 
my spot, chopped down hard 
across the base of his neck with 
the side of my hand. He yelped, 
dropped the light, stumbled to 
hand and knees; the stiff collar 
had protected him from the full 
force of the blow. He scrambled, 
trying to rise ; I followed, kicked 
him square under the chin; he 
back-flipped and sprawled out, 
unconscious. I grabbed up the 
light and found the switch, 
flicked it off. 

“Is he . . . badly hurt?” Oly- 
via was staring at the smear of 
blood at the corner of the slack 
mouth. 

“He’ll have trouble asking for 
bribes for a few weeks,” I pulled 
Olyvia back toward the hedge- 
row. “Let’s hope our snooper did 
not hear anything.” 

We waited for a minute, then 
started off again, hurrying now. 
Far away, a spark of wavering, 
yellowish light moved across the 
slope of the hill beyond the vil- 
lage. 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


51 


"That's the train,” Olyvia 
said. "We’ll have to hurry !” 

We walked briskly for fifteen 
minutes, passed the darkened 
shops at the edge of town, 
reached the station just as the 
puffing coal-burner pulled in. A 
severe-looking clerk in a dark 
uniform with crossed chest 
straps and coat tails accepted 
Olyvia’s money, wrote out tickets 
by hand, pointed out our car. In- 
side we found wide seats uphol- 
stered in green plush. We were 
the only passengers. I leaned 
back in my seat with a sigh. The 
trains whistle shrilled, a lurch 
ran through the car. 

“We’re on our way,” Olyvia 
breathed. She looked ecstatic, 
like a kid at the fair. 

“We’re just going to Rome,” I 
said. “Not the land of Oz.” 

“Who can say,” she said, 
“Whither the road of the future 
leads?” 

CHAPTER VIII 

A t the Albergo Romulus, Oly- 
via and I had adjoining 
rooms well up under the eaves, 
with ceilings that slanted down 
to a pair of dormer windows 
opening onto a market place with 
a handsome Rennaissance foun- 
tain, the incessant flutter of pig- 
eons wings, and a day and night 
shrilling of excited Italian 
voices. We were sitting at the 
small table in my room, eating a 


late breakfast of pizzas pro- 
cured at the corner emporium, 
washed down with a musty red 
wine that cost so little that even 
the local begging corps could af- 
ford to keep a mild buzz on most 
of the time. 

“The two men I’m interested 
in were born somewhere in 
northern Italy about 1850,” I 
told Olyvia. “They came to Rome 
as young men, studied engineer- 
ing and electronics, and in 1893 
made the basic discovery that 
gave the Imperium the Net 
drive. I’m gambling that if 
Baum managed to get himself 
born, and in the nineties was 
writing something pretty close 
to what he did in my world — and 
in the Zero-zero A-line too — then 
maybe Maxoni and Cocini exist- 
ed here too; they didn’t perfect 
the M-C drive, obviously — or if 
they did, the secret died with 
them — but maybe they came 
close ; maybe they left something 
I can use.” 

“Brion, did you not tell me 
that all the worlds that lie about 
your Zero-zero line are desolate, 
blasted into ruin by these very 
forces ? Is it safe to tamper with 
such fell instruments as these?” 

“I’m a fair shuttle technician, 
Olyvia ; I know most of the dan- 
ger points. Maxoni and Cocini 
didn’t realize what they were 
playing with; they stumbled on 
the field by blind luck — ” 

“And in a thousand million 


52 


FANTASTIC 


other worlds of might-have-been 
they failed, and brought ruin in 
their wake . . 

“You knew all this when we 
left Harrow,” I said shortly. 
“It’s my only chance — and a 
damned poor chance it is. I’ll ad- 
mit. But I can’t build a shuttle 
from scratch; there’s a special- 
ly-wound coil that’s the heart of 
the field-generator. I’ve installed 
’em, but I never tried to wind 
one. Maybe — if there was a Max- 
oni here, and a Cocini — and they 
made the same chance discovery 
— and they wrote up their notes 
like good little researchers — and 
the notes still exist — and I can 
find them — ” 

Olyvia laughed — a charming, 
girlish laugh. “If the gods de- 
cree that all those ifs are in your 
favoi' — why then ’tis plain, they 
mean you to press on. I’ll risk it, 
Brion. The vision of the Sapphire 
City still beckons me.” 

“It’s the Emerald City, where 
I come from,” I said. “But we 
won’t quibble over details. Let’s 
see if we can find those notes, 
first; we’ll have plenty of time 
then to decide what to do with 
them.” 

A n hour later, at the local 
equivalent of a municipal 
record center, a tired-looking 
youth in a narrow-cut black suit 
showed me a three-foot wide 
ledger in which names were writ- 
ten in spidery longhand in faded 


ink — thousands of names, fol- 
lowed by dates, places-of-birth, 
addresses, and other pertinent 
details. 

“Securo, Signore,” he said in a 
tone of weary superiority, “The 
municipality, having nothing to 
hide, throws open to you its rec- 
ords — among the most complete 
archives in existence in the Em- 
pire — but as for reading them 
. . .” he smirked, tweaked his 
hair-line mustache. “That the 
Signore must do for himself.” 

“Just explain to me what I’m 
looking at,” I suggested gently. 
“I’m looking for a record of 
Guilio Maxoni, or Carlo Cocini — 

“Yes, yes, so you said; and 
here before you is the registra- 
tion log in which the names of all 
new arrivals in the city were re- 
corded at the time identity pa- 
pers were issued. They came to 
Rome in 1870, you said — or was 
it 1880? You seemed uncertain. 
As for me . . .” he spreads his 
hands. “I am even more uncer- 
tain. I have never heard of these 
relatives — or friends — or ances- 
tors — or whatever they might 
be. In them, you, it appears, have 
an interest. As for me — I have 
none. There is the book, covering 
the decade in question. Look all 
you wish. But do not demand 
miracles of me! I have duties to 
perform!” His voice developed 
an irritated snap on the last 
words. He favored me with what 
he thought was a piercing look

and strutted oflf to sulk some- 
where back in the stacks, I 
grunted and started looking. 

Twenty minutes passed quiet- 
ly. We worked our way through 
1870, started on 1871, The busy 
archivist peered out once to see 
what we were doing, withdrew 
after a sour look. Olyvia and I 
stood at the wooden counter, 
poring over the crabbed long- 
hand, each taking one page of 
about two hundred names. She 
was a fast reader; before I had 
finished my page, she had turned 
to the next. Half a minute later 
she gave a sharp gasp. 

“Brion! Look! Guilio Majtoni, 
born 1847 at Paglio; trade, arti- 
ficer — ” 

I looked. It was the right 
name, I tried not to let myself 
get too excited — but my pulse 
picked up in spite of the voice of 
prudence whispering in my ear 
that there might be hundreds of 
GuHq Maxonis. 

“Nice work, girl,” I said in a 
cool, controlled voice that only 
broke twice on the three words. 
“What address?” 

She read it off ; I jotted it down 
in a notebook I had thoughtfully 
provided for the purpose, added 
the other data from the ledger. 
We searched for another hour, 
but found no record of Cocini. 

M AXONI had lived at number 
twelve. Via Carlotti, fourth 
floor, number nine. With the aid 

54 


of a street map purchased from 
an elderly entrepreneur in a 
beret and a soiled goatee who of- 
fered us a discount on racy post- 
cards which I declined with re- 
gret, we found it — a narrow al- 
ley, choked with discarded paper 
cartons, vegetable rinds, over- 
flowing garbage barrels, and 
shoeless urchins who dodged 
madly among the obstacles, 
cheerfully exchanging bandi- 
nage which would have made 
Mussolini blush. Number twelve 
was a faded late Rennaissance 
front of rusticated granite 
wedged between sagging, board- 
ed-up warehouses no more than a 
hundred or two years old. Max- 
oni, it appeared, had started his 
career in the most modest quar- 
ters available; even a century 
ago, this had been a slum. I 
pushed open the door, caked with 
cracked paint, stepped into a 
narrow hall reeking of garlic, 
cheese, decay, and less pleasant 
things. 

“It looks terrible, Brion,” Olyv- 
ia said. “Perhaps we’d best make 
inquiries first — ” 

A door opened and a round, 
olive-red face set in cushions of 
fat looked out, launched a stream 
of rapid Italian. 

“Your pardon. Madam,” I re- 
plied in the courtly accents I had 
learned from the Roman Ambas- 
sador to the Imperial court. “We 
are but foreigners, visiting the 
Eternal City for the first time. 


FANTASTIC 


We seek the apartment where 
once our departed relative dwelt, 
long ago, when the gods favored 
him with the privilege of breath- 
ing the sweet air of sunny Italy.” 

Her jaw dropped; she stared; 
then a grin the size of a ten-lira 
pizza spread across her face. 

“Buon giomo. Signore e Sig- 
norina!” She squeezed out into 
the hall, pumped our hands, 
yelled instructions back into her 
flat — from which a mouth-water- 
ing aroma of ravioli emanated — 
and demanded to know how she 
could serve the illustrious guests 
of fair Italy. I gave her the num- 
ber of the apartment where Max- 
oni had lived, ninety-odd years 
before, and she nodded, started 
up the narrow stair, puffing like 
the steam-engine. Olyvia fol- 
lowed and I trailed, admiring the 
deposits of broken glass, paper, 
rags and assorted rubbish that 
packed every step and landing, 
with a trail winding up through 
the center, worn by the feet of 
centuries of tenants. I would 
have given odds that the bits 
Maxoni might have contributed 
were still there, somewhere. 

At the top, we went along a 
narrow hall, past battered-look- 
ing doors with white china 
knobs, stopped at the one at the 
end. 

“There is a tenant. Signore,” 
the landlady said. “But he is 
away now, at his job in the fish 
market that I, Sophia Gina Anna 


Maria Scumatti, procured for 
him ! Believe me, if I hadn’t 
given him an ultimatum that the 
rent must be paid or out he’d go, 
he’d be sleeping now, snoring 
like a serviced sow, while I, 
Sophia Gina — ” 

“Undoubtedly the Signora has 
to endure much from ungrateful 
tenants,” I soothed. I had a hun- 
dred lira note ready in my jacket 
pocket — the same oddly-cut num- 
ber that had been in the closet at 
Gunvor’s house. I fished the bill 
out, tendered it with an inclina- 
tion of the head. 

“If the signora will accept this 
modest contribution — ” 

Mama Scumatti puffed out her 
cheeks, threw out her imposing 
bosom. 

“It is my pleasure to serve the 
guest of Italy,” she started; I 
pulled the bill back. 

“. . . but let it not be said 
that I, Sophia Gina Anna Maria 
Scumatti, was ungracious — ” 
Fat fingers plucked the note 
from my hand, dropped it into a 
cleavage like the Grand Canyon. 
“Would the Signore and Signor- 
ina care to enter?” She fumbled • 
a three-inch key from a pocket, 
jammed it in a keyhole you could 
have put a finger through, twist- 
ed it, threw the door wide. 

"Vidil” 

I LOOKED in at a collapsed cot 
snarled with dirty blankets, a 
broken-down table strewn with 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


55 


garishly colored comics, empty 
coffee cups, stained, finger- 
greased glasses, and a half-loaf 
of dry-looking bread. There was 
a bureau with a broken mirror 
with racing tickets tucked under 
the frame, a wooden Jesus dan- 
gling on the wall, and an assort- 
ment of empty wine and liquor 
bottles bearing the labels of in- 
ferior brands, scattered about 
the room in a careless way. The 
odor of the place was a sour blend 
of unlaundered bedding, old 
socks, and a distillery infested 
with mice. 

I looked at Olyvia; she gave 
me a cool smile, turned to our 
hostess. 

“May we go in?” 

Sophia Gina wrinkled her 
brow at me. “My sister would 
like to go inside and . . . ah . . . 
commune with the spirit of our 
departed progenitor,” I translat- 
ed freely. 

The black, unplucked eyebrows 
went up. “But, as the Signore 
sees, the room is occupied !” 

“We won’t touch a thing; just 
look at it. A very emotional mo- 
ment for us, you understand.” 

A knowing look crept over the 
round face. She gave Olyvia, still 
wearing her make-up and rings, 
an appraising once-over, then 
looked me in the eye; one eyelid 
dipped in an unmistakable wink. 

“Ah, but naturally. Signore! 
You and your . . . sister . . . 
would of course wish to com- 


mune — in private. Another hun- 
dred lira, please.” She was sud- 
denly brisk. I forked over silent- 
ly, trying to look just a little 
hang-dog. 

“I dislike to hurry the sig- 
nore,” the concierge said as she 
shook the second note down into 
the damp repository. “But try to 
finish in say two hours, si? 
There is the chance that Gino 
will be back for lunch.” An elbow 
the size and texture of a football 
dug into my side; two fat, bro- 
ken-nailed hands outlined an 
hour-glass in the air; two small, 
black eyes rolled ; then Mama 
Scumatti was waddling off, a 
hippo in a black skirt. 

“What said the fat scoun- 
drel?” Olyvia demanded. 

“Just admiring your figure,” I 
said hastily. “Let’s take a look 
around and see what clues we 
can turn up.” 

* # * 

Half an hour later Olyvia 
stood in the center of the room, 
still wrinkling her nose, hands on 
hips, a lock of hair curling down 
over her damp forehead. 

“It was a hopeless quest from 
the first,” she said. “Let’s be off, 
before my stomach rebels.” 

I dusted off my hands, grimy 
from groping on the backs of 
Shelves and under furniture. 
“We’ve looked in all the obvious 
places,” I said. “But what about 
the unlikely spots? We haven’t 
checked for loose floorboards, se-

FANTASTIC 


cret panels, fake pictures on the 
wall — ” 

“ 'Tis a waste of time, Brion ! 
This man was not a conspirator, 
to squirrel away his secrets in 
the mattress ! He was a poor 
young student, nought more, liv- 
ing in a rented room — ” 

“I’m thinking of little things 
he might have dropped; a bit of 
paper that could have gotten 
stuck in the back of a drawer, 
maybe. Nobody ever cleans this 
place; there’s no reason some- 
thing like that couldn’t still be 
there, even after all these years.’’ 

“Where? Ye’ve had the draw- 
ers out, rooted in the base of the 
chest, lifted that ragged scrap of 
rug, probed behind the base- 
board — ’’ 

She trailed off; her eyes were 
on the boxed-in radiator set un- 
der the one small window. The 
wooden panels were curled, split, 
loose-fitting. We both moved at 
once; Olyvia deftly set aside the 
empty Chianti bottles and the 
tin can half full of cigarette 
butts; I got a grip on the top 
board, lifted gingerly. The whole 
assembly creaked, moved out. 

“Jnst a couple of rusty nails 
holding it,” I said. “I’ll lever it 
free . . 

A minute later, with the help 
of a wooden coat-hanger lettered 
‘Albergo Torino, Roma’, I had 
eased the housing away from the 
wall, revealing a rusted iron ra- 
diator, a few inches of piping, 


enough dust-devils to fill a shoe 
box — and a drift of cigaret 
butts, ticket stubs, bits of 
string, hairpins, a playing card, 
paper clips, and papers. 

O LYVIA oooed, went to her 
knees, I watched as she blew 
dust aside, fished out a folded 
menu, half a sheet of yellowed 
paper with numbers scribbled on 
it, an envelope with a postmark 
in the twenties addressed to one 
Mario Pinotti, two postcards 
with faded black-and-white 
photos of local tourist spots, and 
a brittle square of paper, blank 
on both sides. 

“It was a good idea,” I said. 
“Too bad it didn’t pan out.” Si- 
lently, I replaced the cover, put 
the bottles and ashtray back. 
“You were right, Olyvia, let’s get 
back out in the street where we 
can get a nice wholesome odor of 
fresh garbage — ” 

“Brion, look!” Olyvia was by 
the window, turning the blank 
scrap of paper at an angle to 
catch the sun. “The ink has fad- 
ed, but there was something 
written here . . 

I came over, squinted at the 
paper. There were the faintest of 
faint marks visible. Olyvia put 
the paper on the table, rubbed it 
gently over the dusty surface, 
then held it up to the mirror. The 
ghostly outline of awkward pen- 
manship showed as a grey line. 
“Rub it a little more,” I said

tensely. “Careful — that paper’s 
brittle as ash.’’ She complied, 
held it to the mirror again. This 
time I could make out letters: 

“Instituzione Galileo Merco- 
lidi Giugno 7.3 P.M. 

“Wednesday, June 7th,’’ I 
translated. “This just might be 
something useful. I wonder what 
year that was . . ?’’ 

“I know a simple formula for 
calculating the day on which a 
given date must fall,’’ Olyvia 
said breathlessly. “It will take 
but a moment . . .’’ 

She nibbled at her lip, frown- 
ing in concentration. Suddenly 
her expression lightened. “Yes! 
It fits! June 7, 1871 fell on a 
Wednesday!” She frowned. “As 
did that date in 1899, 1911 — ” 

“It’s something — that’s better 
than nothing at all. Let’s check 
it out. The Galileo Institute : let’s 
hope it’s still in business.” 

A DRIED-UP little man in 
arm-bands and an eye-shade 
nibbled a drooping yellowed mus- 
tache and listened in silence, his 
veined hands resting on the 
countertop as though holding it 
in place as a barrier against 
smooth-talking foreign snoop- 
ers. 

“1871 ; that was a considerable 
time in the past,” he announced 
snappishly. “There have been 
many students at the Institute 
since then; many illustrious sci- 
entists have passed through 


these portals, bringing glory to 
the name of the Galileo.” An odor 
of cheap wine drifted across 
from his direction. Apparently 
we had interrupted his mid- 
morning snort. 

“I’m not applying for admis- 
sion,” I reminded him. “You 
don’t have to sell me. All I want 
is a look at the record of Giulio 
Maxoni. Of course, if your filing 
system is so fouled up you can’t 
find it, you can just say so, and 
I’ll report the fact in the article 
I’m writing — ” 

“You ai-e a journalist?” He 
straightened his tie, gave the 
mustache a twirl, and eased 
something into a drawer out of 
sight behind the counter, with a 
clink of glass. 

“Just give me the same treat- 
ment you’d accord any humble 
seeker after facts,” I said loftily. 
“After all, the public is the own- 
er of the Institute; surely it 
should receive the fullest atten- 
tion of the staff whose bread and 
vino are provided by the public’s 
largesse . . .” 

That got to him ; he made gob- 
bling sounds, hurried away, 
came back wheezing under a vol- 
ume that was the twin to the 
municipal register, slammed it 
down on the counter, blew a 
cloud of dust in my face, and 
lifted the cover. 

“Maxoni, you said sir. 1871 . . . 
1871. . . .” he paused, popped 
his eyes at me. “That wouldn’t 


58 


FANTASTIC 


be THE Maxoni?” his natural 
suspicious look was coming back. 

“Ahhh ...” a variety of sud- 
den emotions were hostling each 
other for space on my face. 
‘‘THE Maxoni ?” I prompted. 

‘‘Guilio Maxoni, the celebrated 
inventor,” he snapped. He 
turned and waved a hand at a 
framed Daguerrotype, one of a 
long, sombre row lining the 
room. ‘‘Inventor of the Maxoni 
churn, the Maxoni telegraph key, 
the Maxoni Improved Galvanic 
Buggy whip — it was that which 
made his fortune, of course — ” 

I smiled complacently, like an 
inspector who’s failed to find an 
error in the voucher files. “Very 
good. I see you’re on your toes 
here at the Institute. I’ll just 
have a look at the record, and 
then ...” I let it trail off as 
Smiley spun the book around, 
pointed out a line with a chewed 
fingernail. 

“Here it is, right here: his 
original registration in the Col- 
lege of Electrics. He was just a 
lad from a poor farming commu- 
nity then ; it was here at the In- 
stitute that he got his start. We 
were one of the first, of course, to 
offer lectures in electrics. The in- 
stitute was one of the sponsors of 
the Telegraphic Conference, la- 
ter in that same year . . .” He 
rattled on with the sales pitch 
that had undoubtedly influenced 
many an old alumnus or would- 
be patron of the sciences to fork 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


over that extra bundle, while I 
read the brief entry. The address 
in the Via Carlotti was given, the 
fact that Maxoni was twenty- 
four, a Catholic, and single. Not 
much help there. . . . 

“Is there any record,” I in- 
quired, “as to where he lived — 
after he made his pile ?” 

The little nian stiffened. 
“Made his pile, sir? I fear I do 
not understand . . .” 

“Made his great contribution 
to human culture, I mean,” I 
amended. “Surely he didn’t stay 
on at the Via Carlotti very long.” 

A sad smile twitched at on.e 
corner of the registrar’s tight 
mouth. 

“Surely the gentleman jests? 
the location of the Museum is, I 
think, well known — even to tour- 
ists.” 

“What museum?” 

The gnome spread his hands 
in a gesture as Roman as grated 
cheese. 

“What other than the museum 
housed in the former home and 
laboratory of Guilio Maxoni? 
The shrine wherein are housed 
the relics of his illustrious ca- 
reer?” 

Beside me, Olyvia was watch- 
ing the man’s face, wondering 
what we were talking about. 
“Pay dirt,” I said to her. Then: 

“You don’t have the address of 
this museum handy, by any 
chance? 

This netted me a superior 

59 


smile. A skinny finger pointed at 
the wall beside him. 

“Number twenty-eight, Strada 
d’Allenzo. One square east. Any 
child could direct you.” 

“We’re in business, girl,” I 
said to Olyvia. 

“Ah . . . what was the name 
of the paper you . . . ah . . . 
claim to represent?” the little 
man’s voice was a nice mixture 
of servility and veiled insolence. 
He was dying to be insulting, 
but wasn’t quite sure it was safe. 

“We’re with the Temperance 
League,” I said, and sniffed 
loudly. “The Maxoni questions 
were just a dodge, of course. 
We’re doing a piece entitled: 
Drinking on Duty, and What it 
Costs the Taxpayer." 

He was still standing in the 
same position, goggling after us, 
when we stepped out into the 
bright sunshine. 

T he Maxoni house was a con- 
servative, stone-fronted build- 
ing that would have done credit 
to any street in the East Seven- 
ties back home. Here was a neg- 
lected-looking brass plate set 
above the inner rail beside the 
glass panelled door, announcing 
that the Home and Laboratories 
of the Renowned Inventor Guilio 
Maxoni were maintained by vol- 
untary contributions to the Soci- 
ety for the Preservation of Mon- 
uments to the Glory of Italy, and 
were open from 9-4, Monday 


through Saturday, and on Sun- 
days, from 1-6 P. M. A card- 
board placard taped to the glass 
invited me to ring the bell. I did. 
Time passed. A dim shape moved 
beyond the glass, bolts rattled, 
the door creaked open, and 
a frowzy, sleep-blurred face 
blinked out. 

“It’s closed. Go away,” a voice 
like the last whinny of a dying 
plow horse said. I got a foot into 
the narrowing space between the 
door and the jamb. 

“The sign says — ” I started 
brightly. 

“Forget the sign,” the blurry 
face wheezed. “Come back to- 
morrow — ” 

I put a shoulder against the 
door, bucked it open, sending the 
charming receptionist reeling 
back. She caught her balance, 
hitched up a sagging bra strap, 
and raised a hand, fingers 
spread, palm facing her, opened 
her mouth to demonstrate what 
was probably an adequate com- 
mand of Roman idiom — 

“Ah — ah, don’t say it,” I cau- 
tioned her. “The Contessa here 
is unaccustomed to the vigor of 
modern speech; she’s led a shel- 
tered life, tucked away there in 
her immense palazzo at Lake 
Constance . . .” 

“Contessa?” A hideous leer 
that was probably intended as 
a simper contorted the sagging 
face. “Oh, my, if I only would’ve 
known her Grace was honoring 


60 


FANTASTIC 


our little shrine with a visit — ” 
she fled. 

“A portal guarded by a drag- 
on,” Olyvia said. “And the fair 
knight puts her to rout with but 
a word.” 

“I used a magic spell on her; 
You’re promoted to Contessa 
now; just smile distantly and act 
aloof.” I looked around the room ; 
it was a standard entry hall, 
high-ceilinged, cream-colored, 
with a stained glass window 
shedding colored light across a 
threadbare, once-fine rug, pick- 
ing up highlights on a marble- 
topped table in need of dusting, 
twinkling in the cut-glass pend- 
ants of a rather nice Victorian 
chandelier. A wide, carpeted 
stairway led up to a sun-lit land- 
ing with another stained-glass 
panel ; a wide, arched opening to 
the left gave a view of a stuffy- 
looking library with a heavy ta- 
ble with pots of wax flowers and 
an open book with a pen and ink- 
pot beside it. There were rows of 
shelves sagging under rows of 
dusty books, uncomfortable 
looking horse-hair chairs and 
sofas, a fireplace with tools un- 
der a mantel on which china gim- 
cracks were arranged in an un- 
even row. 

“Looks like Maxoni went in 
for bourgeois luxury in a large 
way, once he got onto the buggy- 
whip boom,” I commented. “I 
wonder where the lab is ?” 

Olyvia and I wandered around 


the room, smelling the odor of 
age and dust and furniture pol- 
ish; I glanced over a few of the 
titles on the shelves : 

Experiments with Alternating 
Currents of High Potential, and 
High Frequency by Nikola Tesla 
caught my eye, and a slim 
pamphlet by Marconi; otherwise 
the collection seemed to consist 
of good, solid Victorian novels 
and bound volumes of sermons. 
No help here, 

T he dragon came back, look- 
ing grotesque in a housecoat of 
electric green — ^a tribute to Max- 
oni’s field of research, no doubt. 
A layer of cakey-looking make- 
up had been hastily slapped 
across her face, and a rose-bud 
mouth drawn on by a shaky 
hand. She laced her fingers to- 
gether, did a curtsey like a 
trained elephant, gushed at 
Oljrvia, who inclined her head an 
eighth of an inch and showed a 
frosty smile. This example of 
aristocratic snobbishness de- 
lighted the old girl; she beamed 
so hard I thought the make-up 
was going to crack like plaster in 
an earthquake. A wave of an eco- 
nomical perfume rolled over me 
like a dust storm. 

“Her Grace wished to see the 
laboratories where Maxoni did 
his great work,” I announced, 
fanning. “You may show us 
there at once.” 

She shouldered in ahead of me 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME

to get a spot nearer the contessa 
and with much waving of ringed 
hands and trailing of fringes, 
conducted us along a narrow hall 
beside the staircase, through a 
door into a weedy garden, along 
a walk to a padlocked shed, chat- 
tering away the whole time. 

“Of course, the workrooms are 
not yet fully restored,” she flut- 
tered, hauling a key from a bag- 
gy pocket. She got the lock open, 
stopped as she groped inside, 
grunted as she found the light 
switch. A yellowish glow sprang 
up. Olyvia and I stared in at 
dust, lumpy shapes covered with 
tarpaulins, dust, heaped carton, 
dust, grimed windows, and dust. 

“He worked hereV’ 

“Of course it was not so clut- 
tered then. We’re short of funds, 
you see, your Grace,” she got the 
sell in. “We haven’t yet been able 
to go through the items here and 
catalogue them, dispose of the 
worthless things, and restore the 
laboratory to its original condi- 
tion . . .” She chattered on, un- 
abashed by Olyvia’s silence. I 
poked around, trying to look cas- 
ual, but feeling far from calm. 
It was in this shed — or a near 
facsimile — that Maxoni had first 
made the break-through that had 
opened the worlds of alternate 
reality. Somewhere here, there 
might be . . . something I did 
not know what I was looking for : 
a journal, a working model not 
quite perfected . . . 


I lifted the corner of the 
dust cover over a heaped table, 
glanced at the assortment of 
ancient odds and ends ; awk- 
ward, heavy-looking transform- 
ers, primitive vacuum tubes, 
bits of wire — 

A massive object at the center 
of the table caught my eye. I 
lifted the cover, reached for it, 
dragged it to me. 

“Really, sir, I must insist that 
you disturb nothing!” my 
guardian hippo brayed in my 
ear. I jumped, let the tarp fall; 
dust whoofed into the air, “This 
is just as the professor left it, 
that last, fatal day.” 

“Sorry,” I said, holding my 
face in what I hoped was a bland 
expression. “Looks like a collec- 
tion of old iron, to me.” 

“Yes, Professor Maxoni was a 
bit eccentric; he saved all sorts 
of odd bits and pieces — and he 
was forever trying to fit them 
together. He’d had a dream, he 
used to tell my departed Papa — 
when he was alive, of course — 
the professor, I mean — and Papa 
too, of course — 

“Your father worked for Max- 
oni ?” 

“Didn’t you know? Oh, yes, he 
was his assistant, for ever so 
many years. Many the anecdote 
he could tell of the great man — ” 

“I don’t suppose he’s alive?” 

“Papa? Dear Papa passed to 
his reward forty-three — or is it 
forty-four . . ?”

“He didn’t leave a journal, I 
suppose — filled with jolly remi- 
niscenses of the Professor?” 

“No — Papa wasn’t what you’d 
call a lit’ry man.” She paused. 

“Of course, the professor him- 
self was most diligent about his 
journal. Five big volumes; it’s 
one of the great tragedies of the 
Society that we’ve not yet had 
sufficient funds to publish.” 

“Funds may yet be forthcom- 
ing, Madam,” I said solemnly. 
“The Contessa is particularly 
interested in publishing just 
such journals as you described. 

“Oh!” The painted-on mouth 
made a lop-sided 0 to match the 
exclamation. “Your Grace — ” 

“So if you’d just fetch it 
along, so that her Grace can 
glance over it ...” I left the 
suggestion hanging. 

“It’s in the safe, sir — but I 
have the key — I know I have the 
key, somewhere. I had it only 
last year — or was it the year be- 
fore . . ?” 

“Find it, my good woman,” I 
urged. “Her Grace and I will 
wait patiently here, thrilling to 
the thought that it was in this 
very room that the professor de- 
veloped his galvanic buggy- 
whip.” 

“Oh, no, that was before he 
took this house — ” 

“No matter; the journals, 
please.” 

“Wouldn’t you rather come 
back inside ? The dust here — ” 


“As I said, we’re thrilling to 
it. Hurry back . . .” I waved her 
through the door. Olyvia looked 
at me questioningly. 

“I’ve sent her off to find Max- 
oni’s journals,” I said. She must 
have noticed something in my 
voice. 

“Brion, what is it . . ?” 

I stepped to the table, threw 
back the cover. The heavy assem- 
bly I had moved earlier dom- 
inated the scattering of articles 
around it. 

“That,” I said, letting the note 
of triumph come through, “is a 
Moebius-wound coil; the central 
component of the M-C drive. If 
I can’t build a shuttle with that 
and the old boy’s journals. I’ll 
turn in my badge.” 

CHAPTER IX 

T he workshop I rented was a 
twelve-by-twenty space under 
a loft opening off a narrow alley- 
way that wound from the Strada 
d’ Allenzo to a side-branch of the 
Tiber, a trail that had probably 
been laid out by goats, back be- 
fore Rome was big enough to call 
itself a town. The former occu- 
pant had been a mechanic of 
sorts ; there were rusty pieces of 
steam-engine still lying in the 
corners, a few corroded hand- 
tools resting among the dust- 
drifts on the sagging wall- 
shelves at one side of the room, 
odds and ends of bolts and wash-

ers and metal shavings trodden 
into the oil-black, hard-as-con- 
crete dirt floor. The old fellow 
who leased the premises to me 
had grumblingly cleared away 
the worst of the rubbish, and in- 
stalled a large, battered, metal- 
topped table. This, plus the 
Moebius coil, which I had bribed 
the Keeper of the Flame into let- 
ting me borrow, and the jour- 
nals, constituted my lab equip- 
ment. Not much to start moving 
worlds with — but still, a start. 

Olyvia had gotten us rooms 
nearby, cheaper and better quar- 
ters than the Albergo Romulus. 
There was a small hot-plate in 
her room, charcoal-fired; we 
agreed to husband our meagre 
funds by having two meals a day 
in, and the other one at one of the 
small neighborhood pasta palaces 
where the carafes of wine were 
put on the table as automatically 
as salt and pepper back home. 

I started my research program 
by reading straight through all 
five journals — most of which 
were devoted to bitter comments 
on the current political situation 
— the Capitol had just been moved 
to Rome from Florence, and it 
was driving prices up — notes 
on some seemingly pointless re- 
searches into magnetism, the de- 
tails of a rather complicated but 
strictly Platonic affair with a 
Signora C., and worried budget- 
ary computations that enlisted 
ray fullest sympathy. Only in the 


last volume did I start to strike 
interesting passage — the first, 
tentative hints of the Big Secret. 
Maxoni had been experimenting 
with coils; winding them, passi- 
ing various types and amounts of 
electric current through them, 
and attempting to detect results. 
If he’d known more modern phys- 
ics, he’d never have bothered; 
but in his ignorance, he perse- 
vered. Like Edison trying every- 
thing from horse-hair to bamboo 
splints as filaments for his incan- 
descent bulb, Maxoni doggedly 
tried, tested, noted results, and 
tried again. It was the purest of 
pure research; he didn’t know 
what he was looking for — and 
when he found it, he hadn’t known 
what it was — at least not in this 
world. Of course, there had been 
no Cocini here. I didn’t know 
what the latter’s role had been, 
back in the Zero-zero world line ; 
it would be an interesting piece 
of reading for me when I got 
back — if I got back — that is if 
there were any place to get back 
to — 

I let that line of thought die; 
it wasn’t getting me anywhere. 
The last volume of the journal 
yielded up its secrets, such as 
they were — a few scattered and 
fragmentary mentions of the coil 
winding, and a line or two re- 
garding strange manifestations 
obtained with the gold-leaf 
electro-scope when certain trickle 
currents were use.

FANTASTIC 


A WEEK had gone by, and I 
was ready to start the ex- 
perimental phase. There were a 
few electrical supply houses in 
the city, mostly purveyors to the 
Universities and research insti- 
tutes; electricity was far from 
the Reddy Kilowatt stage in this 
world. I laid in a variety of stor- 
age batteries, oscillators, coils, 
condensers, vacuum tubes as big 
and clumsy as milk bottles, plus 
whatever else looked potentially 
useful. Then, at Olyvia's sugges- 
tion, she mesmerized me, took 
notes as I repeated everything 
my subconscious had memorized 
from the training I’d had in 
Net Shuttle technology — ^which 
turned out to be twice as valuable 
as Maxoni’s notes. 

They were pleasant days; I 
rose early, joined Olyvia for 
breakfast, walked the two blocks 
to the shop, and toiled until 
lunch, recording my results in a 
book not much different from the 
ones Maxoni had used a century 
earlier; this was not a world of 
rapid change. Olyvia would come 
by at noon or a little after, look- 
ing fresh and cool, and healthier 
now, with the Roman sun giving 
her face the color it had lacked 
back in Harrow. The basket on 
her arm would produce sand- 
wiches, pizzas, fruit, a bottle of 
wine ; I had a couple of chairs by 
this time, and we’d spread our 
lunch on the corner of my formi- 
dable work bench, with the enig- 


matic bulk of the coil lying before 
us like some jealous idol in need 
of placating. 

Then an afternoon of cut and 
fit and note, with curious pass- 
ers-by pausing at the open door 
to look in and offer polite greet- 
ings and shy questionings; by 
the time a month had passed, I 
was deferred to by all the local 
denizens as a mad foreigner with 
more than a suggestion of the 
sorcerer about him. But they 
were friendly, often dropping off 
a casual gift of a bottle or a 
salami or a wedge of pungent 
cheese with a flourish of Roman 
compliments. Each evening, by 
the time the sun had dropped be- 
hind the crooked skyline across 
the way and the shop had faded 
into deep shadow, hardly relieved 
by the single feeble lamp I had 
strung up, my eyes would be 
blurring, my head ringing, my 
legs aching from the hours of 
standing, hunched over the table. 
I would solemnly close the door, 
attach the heavy padlock, ignor- 
ing the fact that the door was 
nothing but a few thin boards, 
hung from a pair of rusted hinge 
held in place by bent nails ; then 
the walk home past the shops and 
stalls, their owners busy closing 
up now, up the stairs to the flat 
for a quick bath in the rust- 
stained tub down the hall, then 
out with Olywia to the evening’s 
treat. Sitting at the wobbly ta- 
bles on the tile floors, often on a

narrow terrace crowded beside a 
busy street, we talked, watched 
the people and the night sky, then 
went back to part at the flat door 
— she to her room, I to mine. It 
was a curious relationship, per- 
haps — though at the time, it 
seemed perfectly natural. We 
were co-conspirators, engaged in 
a strange quest, half-detectives, 
half researchers, set apart from 
the noisy, work-a-day crowd all 
around us by the fantastic nature 
of the wildly impractical dream 
we were embarked on; she, for 
reasons of romantic fulfillment, 
and I, driven by a compulsion to 
tear through the intangible pri- 
son walls that had been dropped 
around me. 

M ir estimate of Oljwia’s age 
had been steadily revised 
downward ; at first, in the initial 
shock of seeing Mother Goodwill 
unmasked, I had mentally as- 
signed her a virginal fortyish- 
ness ; later, bedizened in her har- 
lot’s finery — and enjoying every 
minute of the masquerade — she 
had seemed younger; perhaps 
thirty-five, I had decided. Now, 
with the paint scrubbed away, 
her hair cut and worn in a cas- 
ual, Roman style, her complexion 
warm and glowing from the sun 
and the walks, her figure as fine 
as ever in the neat, inexpensive 
clothes she had bought in the 
modest shops near our flat — I 
realized with a start one day. 


watching her scatter bread 
crumbs for the pigeons behind 
the shop and laughing at their 
clumsy waddle, that she was no 
more than in her middle twenties. 

She looked up and caught me 
staring at her. 

“You’re a beautiful girl, Oly- 
via,” I said — in a wondering tone. 
I’m afraid. "What ever got you 
off on that Mombi kick?’’ 

She looked startled, then smiled 
— a merrier expression than the 
Lady Sad-eyes look she used to 
favor. 

“You’ve guessed it,’’ she said, 
sounding mischievous. “The old 
witch in the Sorceress of Oz — ’’ 

“Yes, but why?" 

“I told you : my business. 
Who’d patronize a Wise Woman 
without warts on her chin ?’’ 

“Sure — but why haven’t you 
married?’’ I started to deliver the 
old saw' about there being plenty 
of nice young men, but the look 
on her face saved me from that 
banality. 

“OK, none of my business,’’ I 
said quickly. “I didn’t mean to 
get personal, Olyvia ...” I 
trailed off, and we finished our 
walk in a silence which, if not 
grim, was certainly far from 
companionable. 

« 

Three w’eeks more, and I had 
assembled a formidable compila- 
tion of data — enough I told Oly- 


66 


FANTASTIC 


via when she came to the shop at 
ten P.M. to see what had kept me, 
to warrant starting construction 
of the secondary circuits — the 
portion of the shuttle mechanism 
with which I was most familiar. 

“The big job,” I said, “was to 
calibrate the coil — find out what 
kind of power supply it called for, 
what sort of field strength it de- 
veloped. That parts done. Now all 
I have to do is set up the amplify- 
ing and focussing apparatus — ” 

“You make it sound so simple.” 

“I’m trying to convince my- 
self,” I admitted. “It’s a long way 
from simple ; it’s a matter of try- 
ing to equate a complicated as- 
semblage of intangible forces; a 
little bit like balancing a teacup 
on a stream of water, except that 
I have a couple of dozen teacups, 
and a whole fire department 
worth of water-works — and if I 
threw full power to the thing 
without the proper controls . . .” 

“Then what?” 

“Then I’d set up an irreversi- 
ble catyclysm — of any one ef a 
hundred possible varieties. A ti- 
tanic exploMon, that keeps on ex- 
ploding; an uncontrolled erup- 
tion of matter from another con- 
tinuum, like a volcano pouring 
out of the heart of a sun — er 
maybe an energy drain like Ni- 
agara, that would suck the heat 
away from this spot, freeze the 
city solid in a matter of minutes, 
put the whole planet under an 
ice-cap in a month. Or — ” 


“ ’Tis sufficient; I understand. 
These are fearsome forces you 
toy with, Brion.” 

"Don’t worry — I won’t pour 
the power to it until I know what 
I’m doing. There are ways of set- 
ting up auto-timed cut-offs for 
any test I run — and I’ll be using 
trickle power for a long time 
yet. The disasters that made the 
Blight happened because the 
Maxonis and Cocinis of those 
other A-lines weren’t forewarned ; 
they set her up and let her rip. 
The door to Hell has well-oiled 
hinges.” 

“How long — before you’ll fin- 
ish?” 

“A few days. There isn’t a hell 
of a lot to the shuttle; I’ll build a 
simple box — out of pine slabs, if 
I have to; just something to keep 
me and the mechanism together. 
It’ll be a big, clumsy set-up, of 
course — not compacted like the 
Imperial models — but it’ll get me 
there, as long as the power flows. 
The drain isn’t very great. A 
stack of these six volt cells will 
give me all the juice I need to get 
me home.” 

“And if the Xonijeel were 
right,” she said softly. “If the 
world you seek lies not where you 
expect — what then ?” 

“Then I’ll run out of steam and 
drop into the Blight, and that’ll 
be the end of another nut,” I said 
harshly. “And a good thing too — 
if I imagined the whole Impe- 
rium — ” 


THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME

“I know you didn’t, Brion ; but 
if, somehow, something has . . . 
gone wrong. , 

“I’ll worry about that when I 
get to it,” I cut her off. I’d been 
plowing along, wrapping myself 
up in my occupational therapy. I 
wasn’t ready yet to think about 
the thousand gloomy possibilities 
I’d have to face when I stepped 
into my crude makeshift and 
threw the switch. 

I T was three evenings later, and 
Olyvia and I were sitting at a 
window table in one of our regu- 
lar haunts, having a small glass 
of wine and listening to the gen- 
tle night sounds of a city without 
neon and internal combustion. 
She’d been coming by the shop 
for me every evening lately; a 
habit that I found myself looking 
forward to. 

“It won’t be long now,” I told 
her. “You saw the box; just 
bolted together out of wood, but 
good enough. The coil’s installed. 
Tomorrow I’ll lay out my control 
circuitry — ” 

“Brion . . .” Her fingers were 
on my arm. “Look there !” 

I twisted, caught a fleeting 
glimpse of a tall, dark figure in 
a long, full-skirted military-type 
coat with the collar turned up 
pushing past through the sparse 
pedestrian traffic. 

“It was — him!” Olyvia’s voice 
was tight with strain. 

“All right, maybe it was,” I 


said soothingly. “Take it easy, 
girl. How sure are you — ” 

“I’m sure, Brion! The same 
terrible, dark face, the beard — ” 
“There are plenty of bearded 
men in Rome, Olyvia — ” 

“We have to go — quickly !” She 
started to get up; I caught her 
hand, pulled her gently back. 

“No use panicking. Did he see 
us?” 

“I — think — I’m not sure,” she 
finished. “I saw him, and turned 
my face away ; But — ” 

“If he’s seen us — if he is our 
boy — running won’t help. If he 
didn’t see us, he won’t be back.” 

“But if we hurried, Brion — ^we 
need not even stop at the flat to 
get our things ! We can catch the 
train, be miles from Rome by 
daylight — ” 

“If we’ve been trailed here, we 
can be trailed to the next town. 
Besides which, there’s the little 
matter of my shuttle. It’s nearly 
done; another day’s work and a 
few tests — ” 

“Of what avail’s the shuttle, if 
they take you, Brion ?” 

I patted her hand. “Why should 
anyone want to take me? I was 
dumped here to get rid of me — ” 
“Brion, think you I’m some vil- 
lage goose to be coddled with this 
talk ? We must act — now !” 

I chewed on my lip and thought 
about it. Olyvia wasn’t being 
soothed by my bland talk — any 
more than I was. I didn’t know 
what kind of follow-up the Xoni- 


68 


FANTASTIC 


jeelian Web Police did on their 
deportees, but it was a cinch they 
wouldn’t look kindly on my little 
home workshop project. The idea 
of planting me here had been to 
take me out of circulation ; they’d 
back their play, Olyvia was right 
about that. . . . 

“All right,’’ I got to my feet, 
dropped a coin on^the table. Out 
in the street, I patted her hand. 

“Now, you run along home, 
Olyvia; I’ll do a little snooping, 
just to satisfy myself that every- 
thing’s OK. Then—’’ 

“No; I’ll stay with you.’’ 

“That’s silly,’’ I said. “If there 
is any rough stuff, you think I 
want you mixed up in it? Not 
that there will be. . . .’’ 

“You have some madcap 
scheme in mind, Brion; what is 
it? Will you go back to the work- 
shop?’’ 

“I just want to check to make 
sure nobody’s tampered with the 
shuttle. 

Her face looked pale in the 
light of the carbide lamp at the 
corner. 

“You think by hasty work to 
finish it — to risk your life — ” 

“I won’t take any risks, Olyvia 
— but I’m damned if I’m going to 
be thwarted when I’m this close.’’ 

“You’ll need help. I’m not un- 
clever in such matters.” 

I shook my head. “Stay clear of 
this, Olyvia. I’m the one they’re 
interested in, but you could get 
hurt—” 


“How close are you to finishing 
your work ?” 

“A few hours ; then some 
tests — ” 

“Then we’d best be starting ; I 
sense danger close-by this night.” 

I hesitated for just a moment, 
then took her hand. “I don’t know 
what I’ve done to earn such loy- 
alty,” I said. “Come on, we’ve got 
work to do.” 

W E went to the flat first, 
turned on lights, made cof- 
fee; then, with the rooms dark- 
ened, took the back stairs, eased 
out into a cobbled alley. Half an 
hour later, after a circuitous trip 
which avoided main streets and 
well-lit corners, we reached the 
shop, slipped inside. Everything 
looked just as I’d left it an hour 
earlier: the six-foot-square box, 
its sides half slabbed up with 
boards, the coil mounted at the 
center of the plank floor, the 
bright wire of my half-completed 
control circuits gleaming in the 
gloom. I lit a lamp, and we 
started to work. 

Olyvia was more than clever 
with her hands. I showed her 
once how to attach wire to an 
insulator, and she was better at 
it than I was. The batteries re- 
quired a mounting box; I nailed 
a crude frame together, fitted the 
cells in place, wired up a switch, 
made connections. Every half 
hour or so, Olyvia would slip out- 
side, make a quick reconnaisance

— not that it would have helped 
much to discover a spy sneaking 
up on us. I couldn’t quite deduce 
the pattern of their tactics — 
if any. If we had been spotted, 
surely the shop was under sur- 
veillance. Maybe they were just 
letting me finish before they 
closed in; perhaps they were cu- 
ious as to whether it was possible 
to do what I was trying to do 
with the materials and technol- 
ogy at hand . . . 

•» » * 

It was well after midnight 
when we finished. I made a final 
connection, ran a couple of cir- 
cuit checks; if my research had 
been accurate, and my recollec- 
tion of M-C theory correct, the 
thing shovld work. . . . 

“It looks so ... fragile, 
Brion,” Olyvia’s eyes were dark 
in the dim light. My own eyeballs 
felt as though they’d been rolled 
in emery dust. 

“It’s fragile — but a moving 
shuttle is immune to any exter- 
nal influence. It’s enclosed in a 
field that holds the air in, and 
everything else out. And it 
doesn’t linger long enough in any 
one A-line for the external tem- 
perature or vacuum or what have 
you to affect it.” 

“Brion!” She took my arm 
fiercely. “Stay here! Risk not 
this frail device ! ’Tis not too late 
to flee ! Let the evil men search in 
vain ! Somewhere we’ll find a cot- 


tage, in some hamlet far from 
their scheming . . .” 

My expression told her she 
wasn’t reaching me. She stared 
into my eyes for a moment, then 
let her hand fall and stepped 
back. 

“I was a fool to mingle dreams 
with drab reality,” she said 
harshly. I saw her shoulders 
slump, the life go from her face. 
Almost it was Mother Goodwill 
who stood before me. 

“Olyvia,” I said harshly, “For 
God’s sake — ” 

There was a sound from the 
door. I saw it tremble, and 
jumped for the light, flipped it 
off. In the silence, a foot grated 
on bricks; there was a sound of 
rusty hinges, and a lesser dark- 
ness widened as the door slid 
back. A tall, dark silhouette ap- 
peared in the opening. 

“Bayard !” a voice said sharply 
in the darkness — an unmistaka- 
bly Xonijeelian voice. I moved 
along the wall; the figure ad- 
vanced. There was a crowbar 
somewhere near the door. I 
crouched, trying to will myself 
invisible, reached — and my fin- 
gers closed around the cold, rust- 
scaled metal. The intruder was 
two yards away now ; I straight- 
ened, raised the heavy bar; he 
took another step, and I jumped, 
slammed the bar down solidly 
across the back of his head, saw a 
hat fly as he stumbled and fell on 
his face with a heavy crash. 


70 


FANTASTIC 


“Brion!” Olyvia shrieked. 

“It’s all right!” I tossed the 
bar aside, reached for her, put 
my around her. 

“You have to understand, Oly- 
via,” I rasped. “There’s more at 
stake here than any one’s dream ; 
this is something I have to do. 
You have your life ahead. Live it 
— and forget me!” 

“Let me go with you, Brion,” 
she moaned. 

“You know I can’t. Too dan- 
gerous — and you’d halve my 
chances of finding the Zero-zero 
line before the air gives out.” I 
thrust my wallet into her cloak 
pocket. “I have to go now.” I 
pushed her gently from me. 

“Almost ... I hope it fails,” 
Olyvia’s voice came through the 
dark. I went to the shuttle, lit the 
carbide running light, reached in 
and flipped the warm-up switch. 
From the shadows, I heard a 
groan from the creature I had 
stunned. 

“You’d better go now, Olyvia,” 
I called. “Get as far away as you 
can; go to Louisiana, start over 
— forget the Mother Goodwill 
routine. . . .” 

The hum was building now — 
the song of the tortured mole- 
cules as the field build, twisting 
space, warping time, creating its 
tiny bubble of impossible tension 
in the massive fabric of reality. 

“Goodby, Olyvia. ...” I 
climbed inside the fragile box, 
peered at the makeshift panel. 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


The field strength meter told me 
that the time had come. I grasped 
the drive lever and threw it in. 

CHAPTER X 

^HERE was a wrenching sen- 
J- sation, a sputter of arcing 
current through untried circuits ; 
then the walls flicked from view 
around me, and I was looking out 
on the naked devastation of the 
Blight. No need for view-screens 
here ; the foot-wide gaps between 
the rough slats gave me a pano- 
ramic view of a plain of rubble 
glowing softly under the light of 
the moon; a view that shifted 
and flowed as I watched, blacken- 
ing into burned ruins, slumping 
gradually into a lava-like expanse 
of melted and hardened masonry 
and steel. 

I unclenched my teeth, tried a 
breath; everything seemed all 
right; I was riding an egg-crate 
across Hell, but the field was 
holding, leashed by the mathe- 
matical matrices embodied in a 
few hundred strands of wire 
strung just so from nail to nail 
around my wooden cage. The 
massive Moebius coil bolted to 
the floor vibrated nervously — the 
way my stomach felt. I made an 
effort to relax ; I had a long ride 
ahead, and there’d be plenty to be 
nervous about later on. 

My half-dozen jury-rigged in- 
struments were obediently giv- 
ing readings; I looked at the 

71 


trembling needles and tried to 
think about what they repre- 
sented. The only map I had was 
a fuzzy recollection of the photo- 
gram the Xonijeelians had 
showed me. If this was a fourth 
island in the Blight — and I had 
already decided not to question 
that assumption — then I was 
driving in what ought to be close 
to the correct ‘direction’. Meth- 
ods of navigation in the Net de- 
pended on an orientation with an 
arbitrary set of standard values 
— measurements of the strength 
of three of the seemingly infinite 
number of ‘fields’ which were a 
normal part of the multi-ordinal 
continua. A reading of any three 
of these values should give a lo- 
cation ; noting the progressive 
changes in the inter-relation of 
the values provided a plot across 
the Net — maybe. There was the 
little matter of calibrating my 
instruments, determining how 
far my calculated orientation and 
vector varied from the actual, es- 
timating my A-entropic velocity, 
testing my crude controls to see 
how much steering I could do, 
and determining how to bring 
the shuttle into identity square 
on target when and if I found a 
target — and all of this before the 
air became too foul to breathe. 
There was no problem of food, 
water, or a place to sleep ; I’d be 
dead long before any such luxu- 
ries became necessary. 

My first rough approximation 


from the data on the dials 
told me that I was moving along 
a vector at least 150 degrees off 
the calculated one : I made a cau- 
tious adjustment to one of my 
crude rheo.stats, winced as the 
sparks flew, watched the dials to 
see the results. 

They weren’t good. Either I 
was misinterpreting my read- 
ings, or my controls were even 
worse than I’d thought. I scrib- 
bled down figures, made some 
hasty interpolations, and came 
up with the discovery that I was 
blasting along at three times my 
calculated Net velocity, on a 
course that seemed to be varying 
progressively. My hastily rigged, 
untested circuitry was badly out 
of balance — not far enough out to 
spill the leashed entropic force in 
a wild torrent of destruction, but 
too far out to be soothing. 

I made another haphazard ad- 
justment, checked readings; the 
needles wavered, one back-track- 
ing down the scale, two others 
moving steadily upward. I made 
a herculean effort to recall all 
I’d ever known about emergency 
navigation, concluded that I had 
described most of a full circle 
and was now headed back in the 
general direction from which I’d 
started. There wasn’t much play 
left in my controls; I pushed 
the lever which served as rudder 
all the way to the left, watched 
as instruments responded — not 
enough. I had a few wild 


72 


FANTASTIC 


thoughts of re-rigging the 
strands of wire that constituted 
my shield against the boiling 
holocaust of uncontrolled vol- 
canic destruction now churning 
and spewing black gas just be- 
yond my lattice-work walls, but 
gave that up quickly; I couldn’t 
shut down power for anything — 
not here. 

Another ten minutes passed; 
my watch was ticking away, 
measuring off some unimagina- 
ble quality in my timeless, head- 
long plunge across the alternate 
realities. It was like the tooth- 
gritting wait while the lab tech- 
nician probes around with his 
nefedle, looking for a vein; one 
second seemed to last forever. 

Another reading; no doubt 
about it now, I was following a 
roughly spiral course — whether 
descending or ascending, I 
couldn’t tell. The control circuits 
were sparking continously; the 
stresses induced by the unnatu- 
ral entropic loads were rapidly 
overheating the undersized wir- 
ing. A junction box tacked to a 
two-by-four was glowing a dull 
red, and the wood under it was 
smoking, turning black. As I 
watched, pale flames licked, 
caught ran up the wood. I pulled 
off my high-shouldered, wide-la- 
pelled jacket, slapped at the fire, 
uselessly. A wire melted through, 
dropped, spattered fire as it 
crossed other naked wires, then 
hung welded into a new position. 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


For a heart-stopping instant, I 
braced myself for the lurching 
drop into identity with the tow- 
ering pillars of fire thundering 
silently outside — then realized 
that, miraculously, the shuttle 
was still moving. I rubbed smoke- 
stung eyes, checked dials; the 
course had changed sharply. I 
tried to reconstruct the erratic 
path I had taken, work out a 
dead-reckoning of my position. It 
was hopeless. I could be any- 
where. The scene beyond the 
shuttle walls was strange, not 
like anything I remembered from 
Blight exploration films I’d seen. 
A row of steep-sided black cones 
stretched away to the horizon, 
each glowering dull red about its 
crater rim, over which continu- 
ous wellings of lava spilled, while 
vast bubbles burst sending up 
dense belches of brown smoke 
that formed a cloud obscuring 
the moon. Here, it appeared, a 
new fault-line had been created 
in the planet’s crust, along which 
volcanos sprouted like weeds in a 
new-ploughed field. 

I had been on my way for 
about forty minutes now ; with a 
pang of home-sickness I pictured 
Olyvia, back at the flat, alone. 
Suddenly I was remembering the 
days, the evenings we’d spent to- 
gether, her unfailing spirit, the 
line of her throat and cheek as we 
sat at a table, raising glasses in 
the long Roman twilight . . . 

I had had everything there 

73 


a man needed for a good life; 
maybe I’d been a fool to ex- 
change it for this — a doomed 
ride on a hell-bound train to no- 
where. Maybe. But there hadn’t 
really been any choice. There 
were things in life a man had to 
do, or the savor of the salt was 
gone forever. 

I WAS lost now, that was clear 
enough. For the last hour the 
shuttle had been charging across 
the continua blindly, describing 
an erratic course which varied 
every time a connection fused 
and created a new pattern in the 
control circuits. The post was 
still smouldering and smoking, 
using up my scant air and foul- 
ing what was left. I had stretched 
out on the floor some time earlier, 
trying to. find cleaner air ; it was 
about gone now; I coughed with 
every breath, and my head kept 
up a steady humming, like a 
wornout transformer. I was pick- 
ing up some interesting observa- 
tions on the effects of modifying 
shuttle circuitry at full gallop — 
and observing some new country, 
never before explored by our Net 
Scouts — ^but the chances of my 
surviving to use it were dwin- 
dling with each passing minute. 
I had scratched a few lines of 
calculations on the floor with a 
fragment of charred wood ; at the 
rate at which I was moving, I 
was deep in the Blight by now; 
outside the ruined worlds flowed 


past, a panorama of dooms- 
days. The volcanoes were gone, 
shrunken to fiery pits that 
sparked and hurled fountains of 
fire into the black sky. I blinked, 
peering through shrouding mists 
of steam and smoke ; far away, a 
line of dark hills showed — new 
hills, created by the upheavals of 
this world’s crust. The smoke 
thinned for a moment, gave me 
a clearer glimpse of the distant 
landscape — 

Was that a hint of green? I 
rubbed at my eyes, stared some 
more. The hills, dim in the moon- 
light, seemed to show a covering 
of plant life ; the nearby fire pits 
seemed quieter now, stilling to 
glowing pools of molten lava, 
glazing over into dullness. And 
there — ! A scraggly bush, pok- 
ing up at the rim of a crater — 
and another. . . 

I drew a breath, coughed, got 
to hands and knees. The glow 
was fading from the scene 
now; unmistakable pin-points of 
bright green were showing up 
everywhere; a shoot poked 
through the black soil, rose, 
twisted, unfurled a frond, shot 
up higher, extending leaf after 
leaf, in a speeded-up motion-pic- 
ture sequence of growth, each 
frame a glimpse of a different 
A-line, varying by a trifle from 
the next, creating a continuous 
drama of change — a change to- 
ward life. In its erratic wander- 
ing, it appeared, the shuttle had

FANTASTIC 


turned back now toward the edge 
of the Blight. I watched, saw new 
shoots appear, spring up, evolve 
into great tree-ferns, giant cat- 
tails towering palmlike trunks, 
along whose concrete-grey sur- 
faces vines crept like small green 
snakes, to burgeon suddenly, 
embrace the vast tree in a smoth- 
ering outburst of green, clamber 
over the crown, then sink down 
as the tree died and fell, only to 
turn on themselves, mound high, 
reach, capture a new host . . . 

A JUNGLE grew around me 
now, nourished in the volcanic 
soil. Orchids as big as dinner 
plates burst like popcorn, 
dropped, were replaced by other 
orchids as big as washtubs. In 
the bright moonlight, I saw a 
flicker of motion — a new kind of 
motion; a moth appeared, a 
bright spec, grew until he was 
two feet across, then the vast 
flower on which he perched 
closed over him in a frantic flur- 
ry of gorgeous wings and flam- 
boyant petals. Nearby, a wall of 
foliage bulged, burst outward. A 
head thrust through — gaping 
jaws like an immense rat closed 
on vines that coiled, choking. 
. . . The head changed, devel- 
oped armor which grew out, 
blade-like, slicing through the 
ropes of living plant-fibre; juice 
oozed, spilled; thorns budded, 
grew hungrily toward the ani- 
mal, reached the furred throat — 


and recoiled, blunted, from ar- 
mored hide. Then new leaves un- 
folded, reached to enfold the 
head, wrapping it in smothering 
folds of leathery green ; it twist- 
ed, fought, tearing free only to 
be entoiled again, sinking down 
now, gone in a surging sea of 
green. 

I coughed, choked, got to my 
feet, reached for the control pan- 
el, missed and fell. The crack on 
the head helped for a moment. 
I tried to breathe, got only 
smoke ; it was now or never ; the 
worlds outside were far from in- 
viting, but there was nothing for 
me in the shuttle but death by 
asphyxiation. I could drop into 
identity, make hasty repairs, 
study the data I had collected, 
decide where I was, and try 
again. . . . 

Back to hands and knees; a 
grip on a board ; on my feet now, 
reaching for the switch, find it in 
the choking smoke, pull — 

There was a shock, a sense of 
whirling, then a blow that sent 
me flying against shattering 
boards, into rubbery foliage and 
a gush of fresh air . . . 

I finished coughing, extricat- 
ed myself from the bed of vines I 
found myself in, half expecting 
to see them reach for me ; fortu- 
nately, however, the strange 
cause-and effect sequences of E- 
entropy didn’t apply here; that 
stream of pseudo-time was as 
static in normal time as the lat-

ter was during a shuttle ride. 

In the gloom, I made out the 
shape of the flimsy box that had 
brought me here, canted against 
a giant tree-trunk, smashed into 
a heap of scrap lumber. Smoke 
was boiling from under the 
heaped boards, and bright flames 
showed, starting along a wrist- 
thick vine, casting flickering 
light and shadow on surround- 
ing trees and underbrush. There 
was a board under my foot, still 
trailing a festoon of wires; I 
grabbed it up, struggled through 
to the fire, beat at the flames ; it 
was a mistake ; the bruised stems 
oozed an inflammable sap which 
caught with bright poppings and 
cracklings ; I was merely fan- 
ning the flames. The main chas- 
sis of the smashed shuttle was 
too heavy for me to try to drag 
back from the blaze. I tried to 
reach the coil, with some vague 
idea of salvage, but the fire was 
burning briskly now ; the dry 
wood flamed up, sending fire 
high along the tree-trunk, ignit- 
ing mere vines. Five minutes la- 
ter, from a distance of a hundred 
yards, I watched a first-class 
forest fire getting underway. 

The rain started then ; too late 
to salvage anything from the 
shuttle, but soon enough to save 
the forest. I found shelter of 
sorts under a wide-leafed bush, 
and sank into exhausted sleep. 

Morning dawned grey, wet, 
chilly, with water dripping 


from a billion leaves all around 
me. I crawled out, checked over 
assorted bruises, found every- 
thing more or less intact. I still 
had a slight rawness in the 
throat from the smoke, and 
somewhere I’d gotten a nice blis- 
ter on the heel of my left hand, 
but that seemed a modest toll for 
the trip I had had. The fire had 
burned out a ragged oval about a 
hundred feet across; I walked 
across the black stubble to the 
remains of the shuttle, surveyed 
the curled and charred boards, 
the blackened lump that had 
been the coil. The last, faint hope 
flickered and died ; I was strand- 
ed for good, this time, with no 
handy museum to help me out. 

There was a vague sensation 
in my central region that I rec- 
ognized as hunger. I had a lot of 
thinking to do, some vain regrets 
to entertain, a full quota of 
gloomy reflections on what was 
happening now back in the Im- 
perial capital ; but first, I had to 
have food — and, if my sketchy 
knowledge of jungles was any 
guide, a shelter of some sort 
against other inhabitants of the 
region that might consider me to 
be in that category. 

And even before food, I need- 
ed a weapon. A bow and arrow 
would be nice, but it would take 
time to find a suitable wood, and 
I’d have to kill something for gut 
for the string. A spear or club 
was about all I’d be able to man-

age in my present state of tech- 
nological poverty. And even for 
those. I’d need some sort of cut- 
ting edge — which brought me 
back to the stone age in two easy 
steps. 

Well, the best source for nice 
useful-sized stones would be a 
stream — and while there, I could 
get a drink — not that there was 
not plenty of water dripping 
down my neck here. The shoes I 
wore — stiff, loafer-type clod- 
hoppers with buckles — weren’t 
the best for negotiating the un- 
even ground, but after all, my 
remote ancestors hadn’t had that 
much. 

The ground had a slight slope 
to what I suspected was the east ; 
I pushed my way through the 
thick growth — not as jungle-like 
as what I’d seen from the shuttle 
minutes before my crash land- 
ing, but not a nice pic-niccy sort 
of New England wood either. I 
kept to the down-slope stopping 
now and then to listen for gur- 
gling streams or growling bears. 
The Boy Scout lore paid off; I 
broke through into a swampy 
crescent hugging a grey mudflat 
with a meandering current at its 
center fifty feet distant. Tight- 
packed greenery hung over the 
far side of the watercourse, 
which curved away around a spit 
of more of the grey mud. There 
were no stones in sight. Still, 
there was plenty of clay — good 
for pottery making, perhaps, I 


squatted, dipped up a sample; it 
was thin and sandy muck, use- 
less. 

There was ample room to walk 
beside the stream ; I followed the 
course for several hundred 
yards, found a stretch of higher 
ground where the water came 
close to a bank of grassy soil. 
This would make as good a camp- 
site as any. I pulled off my shoes, 
eased over the edge into the wa- 
ter, sluiced the worst of the soot 
and mud from myself and 
clothes. Turning back, I noticed 
a strata of clean yellowish clay 
in the bank. It was the 
real stuff : smooth, pliable, al- 
most greasy in texture. All I 
needed was a nice fire to harden 
it, and over which to cook my 
roasts, chops, fish fillets, et cet- 
era — as soon as I had acquired 
the latter, using the weapons I 
would make as soon as I had an 
axe and a knife. . . . 

I T was almost sunset. The day’s 
efforts had netted me one 
lump of flint, which I had suc- 
ceeded in shattering into a hand- 
axe and a couple of slicing edges 
that any decent flint-worker 
would have tossed into the dis- 
card pile for archaeologists to 
quarrel over a few thousand 
years later. Still, they had suf- 
ficed to hack off two twelve-foot 
lengths of a tough, springy sap- 
ling, remove the twigs and 
leaves, and sharpen the small

ends to approximate points. I 
had also gathered a few handfuls 
of small black-berry like fruits 
which were now giving me severe 
stomach pains, and several 
pounds of the pottery clay which 
I had shaped into crude bowls 
and set aside for air drying. The 
skies had cleared off in the after- 
noon, and I had built a simple 
shelter of branches and large 
leaves, and dragged in enough 
nearly-dry grass for a bed of 
sorts. And using a strip of cloth 
torn from my shirt, I had made 
a small fire-bow. With a supply 
of dry punk from the interior of 
a rotted tree, and a more or less 
smooth stone with a suitable hol- 
low, I was now preparing to 
make fire. My hardwood stick 
was less hard than I would have 
liked, and the bow was a clumsy 
makeshift, but it was better than 
just sitting and thinking. I 
crumbled the wood powder in the 
hollow, placed the pointed end of 
the stick against it with the bow 
string wrapped around it, and 
started in. 

Ten minutes later, with the 
bow twice broken and mended, 
the stick dulled, and the punk 
and my temper both exhausted, I 
gave it up for the night, crawled 
into my cosy shelter. Two min- 
utes later, a bellow like a charg- 
ing elephant brought me bolt up- 
right, groping for a gun that 
wasn’t there. I waited, heard a 
heavy body crashing through 


underbrush nearby, then the an- 
noyed growl that went with the 
kind of appetite that preferred 
meat. There were a number of 
large trees in the vicinity; I 
found one in the dark with amaz- 
ing speed, climbed it, losing a 
trifling few square feet of skin in 
the process, and wedged myself 
in a high crotch and listened to 
stealthy footsteps padding under 
my perch until dawn. 

I FOUND the tracks the next 
morning when I half-climbed, 
half fell from the tree. They were 
deeply imprinted, too big to cov- 
er with my spread fingers, not 
counting the claws — on the 
prints, that is. Some kind of cat, 
I guessed. Down at the water’s 
edge were more tracks : big hoof- 
marks the size of saucers. They 
grew ’em big in these parts. All 
I had to do was bag one, and I’d 
have meat for as long as I could 
stand the smell. I was getting 
really hungry now ; following the 
stream, I covered several miles to 
the south, gradually working my 
way into more open country. 
There were plenty of signs of 
game, including the bare bones 
of something not quite as big as 
a London bus, with eondor-like 
birds picking over them half- 
heartedly. I had my two spears 
and my stone fragments, and I 
was hoping to spot something ap- 
propriate to my resources — say a 
half-grown rabbit. 


78 


FANTASTIC 


There was a sudden rattle of 
wings just in front of me, and 
a grousy-looking bird as big as a 
turkey took to the air. I advanced 
cautiously, found a nest with 
four eggs in it, speckled brown, 
three inches long. I squatted 
right there and ate one, and en- 
joyed every scrap. It would have 
been nice to have scrambled it, 
but that was a minor considera- 
tion. The other three I distrib- 
uted in various pockets, then 
went on, feeling a little better 
now. 

The country here was higher, 
with less underbrush and more 
normal-looking trees in place of 
the swampy jungle growth I’d 
started from. During highwater, 
I imagined, the whole area where 
the shuttle lay would be sub- 
merged. Now I had a better view, 
off through the open forest to 
what seemed like a prairie to the 
south. That’s where the game 
would be. 

Another half hour’s walk 
brought me to the edge of a vast 
savannah that reminded me of 
pictures I’d seen of Africa, with 
immense herds grazing under 
scattered thorn trees. Here the 
trees were tall hardwoods, grow- 
ing in clumps along the banks of 
the stream — and the animals 
were enough to make any zoo- 
keeper turn in his badge and 
start keeping white mice. I saw 
bison, eight feet at the shoulder ; 
massive, tusked almost-ele- 


phants with bright pink trunks 
and pendulous lower lips; deer in 
infinite variety ; and horses built 
like short-necked giraffes, ten 
feet high at the shoulder with 
sloping withers. There they were 
— and all I had to do was to stick 
them with my spear. 

There was a low snort from 
somewhere behind me ; I whirled, 
saw a head the size of a rhino’s 
set with two rows of huge, nee- 
dle-sharp teeth in a mouth that 
gaped to give me a view of a 
throat like the intake duct on a 
jet fighter. There was a body be- 
hind the head — ten feet or more 
of massively muscled tawny, 
blonde cat, with a hint of mane, 
faint stripes across the flanks, 
snow white throat, belly and feet. 
I took all these details in as the 
mighty carnivore looked me over, 
yawned, and paced majestically 
toward me, frowning across at 
the distant herds like a troubled 
politician wondering who to pay 
the bribe to. He passed me up at 
a distance of thirty feet, moved 
out into the area, head high now 
looking over the menu. None of 
the animals stirred. King cat 
kept on, by-passed a small group 
of mastodons who rolled their 
eyes, switching their trunks 
nervously. He had his eye on the 
bison, among whom were a num- 
ber of cuddly calves weighing no 
more than a ton. They moved 
restlessly now, forming up a de- 
fensive circle, like the musk-ox

of the Arctic. The hunter varied 
his course, angling to the left. 
Maybe he was thinking better of 
it — 

With the suddenness of 
thought, he was running, streak- 
ing across the grass in thirty- 
foot bounds, leaping now, clear 
over the front rank of tossing 
horns to disappear as the herd 
exploded outward in all direc- 
tions ; then he reappeared, stand- 
ing over the body of a calf, one 
paw resting affectionately on the 
huddled tan corpse. The herd 
stampeded a short distance, re- 
sumed feeding. I let out a long 
breath. That was a hunter, 

I jumped at a sound, spun, my 
hand with my trusty spear com- 
ing up automatically — 

A brown rabbit the size of a 
goat stood poised on wiry legs, 
snuffling the air, showing long 
yellow i-at-teeth. I brought the 
spear back, threw, saw it catch 
the creature in mid leap as he 
whirled to flee, knocking him 
head over long white heels. I 
came pounding up, swung the 
second spear like a farmer’s wife 
killing a snake, laid him low. 

Breathing hard, I gingerly 
picked up the bloody carcass, 
noting the gouge my spear had 
made, looked around for a place 
to hide up and feast. Something 
black moved on my arm. A flea! 
I di'opped the rabbit, captured 
the parasite, cracked him with a 
satisfying report. There were 


plenty more where that one came 
from, I saw, stirring around in 
the sparse hair on the foot-long 
ears. Suddenly I didn’t want 
raw rabbit — or overgrown rat — 
for lunch. 

As suddenly as that the adren- 
alin I’d been getting by on for 
the past thirty-six hours drained 
away, left me a hungry, sick bat- 
tered cast-away, stranded in a 
hell-world of raw savagery, an 
unimaginable distance from a 
home which I knew I’d never see 
again. I had been bumbling 
along from one fiasco to the next, 
occupying my mind with the 
trivial, unwilling to face reality ; 
the chilling fact that my life 
would end, here, in solitude and 
misery, in pain and fear — and 
that before many more hours 
had passed. 

I LAY under a tree, staring up 
at the sky, resting, I told my- 
self — or waiting for another cat, 
less choosy, to happen along. I 
had had my chances — more than 
one — and I’d muffed them all. 
I’d gotten away clean in the Ha- 
groon shuttle — then let it carry 
me helplessly along to their den- 
city, permitted myself to be cap- 
tured without a struggle, think- 
ing I’d learn something from the 
gorilla men. And after a combi- 
nation of the enemy’s stupidity 
and my luck had given me a new 
chance, a new shuttle — I’d 
guessed wrong again, let Dzok

beguile me along to be sentenced 
to life in exile. And a third time 
— after my wild guesses had 
paid off — I had panicked, run 
from the enemy without waiting 
to test my home-built shuttle — 
and ended here. Each time I had 
made what seemed like the only 
possible choice — and each time 
I’d gotten farther from my start- 
ing point. Not farther in terms 
of: Net distance, perhaps, but in- 
finitely farther from any hope of 
rescue — to say nothing of my 
hope of warning the Imperial 
authorities of what was afoot. 

I got to my feet, started back 
toward where I’d left the wreck- 
age of the shuttle, with some 
half-formed idea of searching 
through the wreckage again — 
for what, I didn’t know. It was 
the blind instinct of one who had 
absorbed all the disaster he can 
for a while, and who substitutes 
aimless action for the agony of 
thought. 

It was harder now, plodding 
back over the ground I’d already 
covered. Following the course of 
the river, I passed the huge skel- 
eton — abandoned now by the 
birds — reached the mud-flat 
where the trampled remains of 
my crude hut gave a clear indi- 
cation of the inadequacies of my 
choice of cam-sites. 

I had an idea of sorts then; 
back at the shuttle there was a 
lump of metal — the remains of 
the original Maxoni coil. I might 


be able to use the material in 
some way — pound it out into 
spear-heads, or make a flint-and- 
steel for fire-starting pur- 

pOS6S • • • 

The impulse died. My stomach 
ached, and I was tired. I wanted 
to go home now, have a nice hot 
bath, crawl into bed, and be 
joined there by someone soft and 
perfumed and cuddly who’d 
smooth my fevered brow and tell 
me what a hell of a guy I 
was. . . . 

It was easy to see the mechan- 
ics of schizophrenia at work 
here. From wishing, it was an 
easy jump to believing. I took a 
couple of deep breaths, straight- 
ened my back, and headed for the 
burn-site. I’d try to retain my 
grip on reality a little longer; 
when it got unbearable, I knew 
the sanctuary of insanity would 
be waiting. 

T here were animal tracks 
across the blackened ground, 
hoof-marks, paw prints, and — 

I bent over, squinting to be 
sure. Foot-prints, human, or near 
enough. I knew how Robinson 
Crusoe felt now; the evidence of 
a fellow Man gave me a sudden 
feeling of exposure along my 
backbone. I made it to the sur- 
rounding unburned wall of jun- 
gle in three jumps, slid down 
flat on the ground, and scanned 
the landscape. I tried to tell my- 
self that this was a lucky break.

the first real hope Fd had — but 
an instinct older than theories 
of the Brotherhood of Man told 
me that I had encountered the 
world’s most deadly predator; 
the fact that we might be of the 
same species just meant compe- 
tition for the same hunting 
ground. 

My spear wasn’t a handy 
weapon, and my skill with it 
wasn’t anything to strike a 
medal in prise of. I checked my 
pocket for one of my stones, 
found a smashed egg. For a mo- 
ment, the ludicrousness of the 
situation threatened to start me 
snickering ; then I heard a sound 
from nearby — in what direction, 
I wasn’t sure. I eased back, rose 
up far enough to scan the woods 
behind me, saw nothing. I tried 
to think the situation through. 
If I was right — if it was a man 
who’d visited here — it was im- 
portant to establish contact. 
Even a primitive would have 
some sort of culture — food, fire, 
garments of sorts, shelter. I had 
skills : pottery making, basket 
weaving, the principle of the 
bow. We could work out some- 
thing, perhaps — but only if I 
could survive the first meeting. 

I heard the sound again, saw a 
deer-like creature making its 
way across the burn. I let out a 
breath I didn’t know I’d been 
holding and relaxed. There was 
no way of knowing how long ago 
the man-prints had been made. 


Still, I couldn’t lie here forever. 
I emerged, made a quick check 
of the burned-out shuttle. Every- 
thing was as I’d left it. I took 
another look at the footprints. 
They seemed to be made not by a 
bare foot, but by a heelless san- 
dal of some sort. They came 
across the bum, circled the 
shuttle, went away again; and 
on the latter portion of the trail, 
they clearly overlay my own 
booted prints. Whoever my visi- 
tor had been, he was following 
me — or had started out on my 
trail. It was a thought that did 
nothing for my peace of mind. 

I tried to calm the instinct 
that told me to get as far from 
the spot as possible. I needed to 
meet this fellow — and on terms 
that I could control. I didn’t 
want to kill him — but neither did 
I want to try the palm outward T 
friend of long-knife routine. 
That left — capture. 

I T was risky business, working 
out in the open, but then be- 
ing alive was a risky business. 
If the man tracking me had fol- 
lowed my trail, then lost it some- 
where on the high ground, it 
might be a matter of many hours 
before he came back here to cast 
about again — and I was sure, for 
some reason, that he’d do the 
latter. And when he did — 

I had been working hard for 
two hours now, setting up my 
snare. It wasn’t fancy, and if my 


82 


FANTASTIC 


proposed captive were any kind 
of woodsman — which he had to 
be, to survive here — it wouldn’t 
fool him for a moment. Still, it 
was action of a sort — occupa- 
tional therapy, maybe, but better 
than hiding under a bush and 
waiting — and it was helpful to 
my morale to imagine that I was 
taking the initiative. 

The arrangement consisted of 
a shallow pit excavated in the 
soft soil, covered over with a 
light framework of twigs and 
leaves, and camouflaged with a 
scattering of blackened soil. I 
had done the digging with my 
bare hands, helped out by a 
board from the wreck, and the 
dirt had been heaped under the 
brush, out of sight behind the 
wall of foliage. The hole was no 
more than four feet deep, but 
that was sufficient for my pur- 
pose — to throw the intruder off- 
balance, give me the drop on him 
sufficiently to open negotiations; 
a handy advantage. 

I was hungry enough now to 
scrape one of the smashed eggs 
from the lining of my pocket and 
eat it; but first I had to select 
my hiding place and get ready 
to act when the victim stepped 
into the trap. I picked a spot off 
to the left, arranged myself so 
as to be able to jump out at the 
psychological moment, and set- 
tled down to wait. 

The pit was dug just in front 
of the wreckage, at the point 

THE OTHER SIDE OF TIME 


where the opening to the interior 
would lead an inqusitive victim; 
I had dropped a lacy-edged 
hanky just inside the opening as 
an added attraction. It was one 
Olyvia had lent me to mop my 
forehead during the last, all- 
night session, and it still held a 
whiff of a perfume that would 
attract a primitive more surely 
than a scattering of gold coins. I 
had done all I could; the next 
step was up to the opposition. 

I AWOKE from a light doze to 
see that it was late evening. 
The trees were black lace-work 
against a red-gold sky, and the 
chirruping of crickets and the 
shrill tseet ! tseet ! of a bird were 
the only sounds against an abso- 
lute stillness — 

And then the crackle of un- 
derbrush, the snap of broken 
twigs, the sound of heavy 
breathing. ... I froze, trying 
to see through the gloom. He was 
coming ; Hell, he was there ! And 
making no effort at stealth. He 
was sure of himself, this native 
— which probably meant that 
here in his own stamping gi-ound 
he was top carnivore. I tried to 
picture the kind of man who 
could stand up to the King Cat 
I’d seen, and gave it up as too 
discouraging. And this was the 
fellow I was going to trip up and 
then threaten with a broom han- 
dle . . . 

I swallowed the old corn husks

that had gotten wedged in my 
throat, squinted some more, 
made out a tall figure coming 
across the burned ground, stoop- 
ing, apparently peering around, 
looking for me, no doubt. The 
thought gave me no comfort. I 
couldn’t see what kind of weapon 
be had ; I gripped my spear, 
tried to hold my breathing to a 
deep, slow rhythm. He was close 
now, pausing to glance over the 
shuttle, then turning toward the 
entrance hold. The handkerchief 
would be visible in the dim light, 
and the scent ... He took a 
step, another; he was close now, 
a vague, dark shape in deep 
shadow — 

There was a choked yell, a 
crashing, a thud, and I was out 
of my hidey-hole, stumbling 
across a tangle of roots, bring- 
ing my spear up, skidding to a 
halt before the pale torso and 
dark head of the man who strug- 
gled, scrabbling for a hand-hold, 
hip-deep in my trap. 

“Hold it right there!” I 
barked through clenched teeth, 
holding the spear ready with 
both hands, poised over the man 
who stood frozen now, a narrovi^- 
shouldered, long-armed figure, 
his face a dark blob under a 
white head-piece. 

“I say, Bayard,” Dzok’S voice 
came. “You’ve led me a merry 
chase, I must say !”

FANTASTIC 



TERMINAL 

By RON GOULART 


The Senior Citizens’ Club has an anteroom 
beyond the red door. Try not to go through. 


i T was while the tacky white 
enameled android was putting 
the second scoop of beans on his 
breakfast tray that Penrose be- 
gan to wonder if he was really 
old. Penrose put one hand flat on 
his face, feeling for wrinkles. 
The serving android flipped an- 
other scoop of beans out of the 
cauldron set in its chest. This 
one missed the tray and dropped 
on to the tan blanket of Pen- 
rose’s bed. The android ticked 
and more beans fell on the cot. 

The old man in the next bed 
stretched a foot out from under 
the covers and kicked the andy. 
The machine ratcheted and 
whirred, then said, “Good morn- 
ing. Have a happy day.” It rolled 
away to serve the fat man across 
the aisle. 

“I’m Harrison,” said the old 
man who had booted the android. 
He was lanky, weathered. His 
face had deep sharp wrinkles. He 
turned slightly in the bunk and 


Penrose saw that he had only 
one arm. 

Penrose hesitated. “I’m Pen- 
rose,” he said Anally. "Excuse 
me. I’m fuzzy about things.” He 
couldn’t remember even yester- 
day he realized now. 

Harrison swallowed a spoonful 
of orange beans. “You know 
where you are, don’t you ?” 

Their room was small, metal- 
lic, with a low grey ceiling. There 
were six beds in it. Only five of 
them occupied. At the far end 
was a red metal door. “I guess,” 
said Penrose. “I’m not certain.” 

“Where do you think?” 

Penrose looked down at his 
tray. The two scoops of beans 
had collapsed into a single pool. 
“Well, this is Greater Los An- 
geles. And the date is . . . it’s 
October 15, 2046. Yes, I know 
that.” 

“It’s the 16th,” corrected Har- 
rison. 

Nodding, Penrose said, “Oh, 


85 


that’s right. I’m missing a day.” 

“You’re in Senior Citizens’ 
Terminal #130,” said Harrison. 

The men in the other beds 
were old, too, like Harrison. Pen- 
rose touched his face again. “I’m 
not quite sure why I’m here. I’ve 
been having trouble remember- 
ing exactly. I have a feeling I’m 
not . . . not a senior citizen.” 

“Neither am I,” called the fat 
old man across the aisle. He was 
pink and grey. 

“That’s Carlisle,” said Harri- 
son. “He has memory trouble, 
too.” 

“I know you, Harrison,” said 
Carlisle. “You’re a mean old 
coot. You’re old enough to be my 
grandfather. You maybe are my 
grandfather. He was a mean old 
one-armed man, too. Except it 
was his right arm he was lack- 
ing.” 

The serving android was mak- 
ing harsh scraping sounds now. 
It had stopped by the bed of a 
small quiet old man. The man 
was flat on his back, not mov- 
ing, breathing softly through hie 
mouth. His hair was long and 
fine and his skin was a trans- 
parent blue-white. “Good morn- 
ing. Have a happy day,” said the 
android, propping the old man up 
and spoon feeding him from the 
cauldron. 

“That’s Guttenberg,” said 
Harrison. “He’s eighty.” 

“I bet he doesn’t know who he 
is either,” said Carlisle. 

86 


P ENROSE watched Harrison 
finish breakfast. “Is every- 
one sick here?” 

“No,” said Harrison. “You 
must know all about the Senior 
Citizens’ Terminals. Think about 
it.” 

Penrose leaned back against 
the metal head rest. “The Senior 
Citizens’ Terminals,” he said, 
“are under the jurisdiction of 
the United States Welfare Squad. 
And are free to all. The problem 
of the aged is at a stage of solu- 
tion never before known. Nearly 
one hundred old timers are col- 
lected each month in each termi- 
nal. Because of the Welfare 
Squad these old folks can live out 
their golden days without fear of 
burdening their friends and re- 
lations.” Now that he thought 
about it Penrose realized he knew 
a lot about the terminals. But he 
didn’t know why he was here. 

“You’re doing excellently,” 
said old Harrison. “Do you re- 
call the recruiting part of this 
set up?” 

“Stop now,” said Carlisle. “I’m 
trying to recollect who I really 
am and your talk is unsettling to 
me.” 

“You’re Carlisle,” said Harri- 
son. “A retired data processor.” 

“No, I’m not,” said the heavy 
old man. “I’m a spry young fel- 
low with a name that starts with 
W.” 

“About recruiting,” Harrison 
said to Penrose. 


FANTASTIC 


Penrose concentrated. “It is 
the function of the Welfare 
Squad to recruit at least a mini- 
mum quota of old folks each col- 
lection period. Those old timers 
who are not reclaimed in 30 days 
are then processed at no extra • 
cost.” 

“Quit,” called out Carlisle. “I 
don’t want to hear about that.” 

“He’s been here 28 days,” said 
Harrison. 

The fifth man in the room 
stood up on top of his cot. He 
was small with straight-standing 
white hair and black pockets un- 
der his pale eyes. 

“There are things of which I 
may not speak; 

There are dreams that cannot 
die; 

There are thoughts that make 
the strong heart weak. 

And bring a pallor to the 
cheek. 

And a mist before the eye,” 
he said. 

“That’s Remmeroy,” said Har- 
rison. “He gets processed next 
week.” 

Remmeroy’s bed was suddenly 
pulled out from under him and 
slid back into the grey metal wall. 
The old man thunked to the floor. 

Harrison swung out of his cot 
just as it shot away and he 
caught Penrose up and out of 
his. “We arise abruptly in this 
place.” 

The serving android opened a 
panel in the wall and buzzed out 


of the room. “Have a happy day.” 

T he big blond recreational 
android joggled Penrose by 
the shoulder. “No wool gather- 
ing, Fowler. This is letter writ- 
ing time.” 

Penrose had almost remem- 
bered something important. “I’m 
not Fowler,” he said. 

The second joggle was harsher. 
“Letter writing time, pops.” 

“Sorry,” he said. He picked up 
the speaker tube of the lap let- 
teriter. The andy moved on and 
Penrose dictated, “To whom it 
may concern. I still don’t know 
what I’m doing here. I am con- 
fused and depressed.” 

The letteriter jumped out of 
his lap and began bouncing on 
the floor, making a bleeting 
sound. “Negative, negative.” 

The blond andy was at his 
shoulder again. “Fowler, you’re 
not doing so good today.” 

“I guess not.” 

“You guess? Cramps, you 
know not. Now I want you to 
speak a nice pleasant letter. Get 
me?” 

“Yes, sir.” The letteriter 
crawled up his left leg and set- 
tled into his lap, nudging him 
sharply in the groin. “I’m not 
sure,” said Penrose, “who it is 
I’m writing to.” 

“The therapy,” said the blond 
android, “is in the act and is not 
involved with the recipient at 
all.” 


TERMINAL 


87 


“Hello, everybody,” dictated 
Penrose. “I’m having a great 
time here.” He felt the android’s 
grip lessen. “I’m having a happy 
day.” The hand was lifted away 
but Penrose kept saying cheerful 
things. 

Carlisle was having trouble. 
“I’m trying to communicate with 
my girl friend,” he told the rec 
andy. “Her name begins with an 
F or an S.” 

“Just say you’re fond of her,” 
answered the android. 

“I am, I am,” said Carlisle. “I 
can’t start off the letter with 
‘Dear F or S.’ You see?” 

“Start.” 

“Sweetheart,” said Carlisle 
into his tube. 

Remmeroy used his letteriter 
standing up. He was hunched in 
a corner with it under his arm. 

“When the lamp is shattered 

The light in the dust lies 
dead — 

When the cloud is scattered. 

The rainbow’s glory is shed. 

When the lute is broken. 

Sweet tunes are remembered 
not . . .” 

“That’s right,” said the pass- 
ing android, “keep it cheerful.” 

Guttenberg, his hands limp at 
his sides, was propped in a chair. 
“Come on, gramps,” said the 
android. “Talk. Send off some- 
thing friendly to your loved 
ones.” 

Penrose turned to Harrison, 
who was sitting next to him, his 

88 


letter writing done. “Why don’t 
they leave Guttenberg alone? He 
can’t even speak, can he?” 

“No,” said Harrison. 

“It doesn’t make sense.” 

“Not efficient, is it?” 

Penrose hesitated. “The Wel- 
fare Squad has an able and quali- 
fied staff of checkers, the Effi- 
ciency Detail. It is their duty to 
make a thorough inspection peri- 
odically of each and every Senior 
Citizens’ Terminal.” 

“Yes, that’s true,” said Har- 
rison. 

“Of course,” said Penrose, 
“fellows in the Efficiency Detail 
are overworked and underpaid. 
Sometimes they can’t be as thor- 
ough as they’d like to be.” 

The recreational andy held the 
speaker up near Guttenberg’s 
mouth. “A ten word message, 
pops. You can do that much. 
Come on.” 

“Can’t we stop him?” Penrose 
asked. 

“He turns off automatically 
when the recreation period ends. 
Guttenberg is able to hold out till 
then.” 

“This happens every day?” 

Harrison nodded. 

“Therapy time,” announced a 
crisT) voice from the wall. 

The blond android let go of 
Guttenberg. 

T he therapist was shaped like 
a portable safe and had a gun 
metal finish. 


FANTASTIC 


“Now,” said Penrose when it 
was his turn, “this is going to 
sound odd to you.” 

“Not at all, Mr. Fowler,” said 
the metal box in a warm voice. 

Penrose fidgeted on the arm- 
chair that had come up through 
the fioor. “First off, I’m not Fowl- 
er. I’m Penrose. Now here’s the 
situation as I see it. Let me, by 
the way, apologize for being 
vague in some of the details. I 
realize now that I’ve probably 
been given some kind of medica- 
tion. Look,” he said, rolKng up 
the sleeve of his tan shirt, “you 
can’t help but see the needle 
marks, several of them. And 
some in my backside, too. While 
I appreciate the smooth efficient 
way I was given medical aid I 
have to say I’m disturbed that I 
haven’t snapped out of it better.” 

“Yes, of course, Mr. Fowler,” 
said the therapist. 

“No, I’m not Fowler. Let’s skip 
that for a minute. I think I had 
some sort of accident or some- 
thing and was taken maybe to 
the nearest hospital. Fine. How- 
ever, there seems to be a mistake 
being made. I’m not this Fowler, 
In fact you can see that I’m not 
even old. I’m not a senior citizen. 
It’s hardly eflficient, is it? To keep 
me on here.” 

“Certainly, certainly.” 

“When I woke up this morning 
I was much fuzzier than I am 
now. Things are starting to fill 
in for me. I’m certain I'm about 


thirty four years old. There must 
be, though I can’t remember it 
as yet, some useful function I fill 
on the outside. Some part of the 
essential function of Greater Los 
Angeles.” 

“That’s surely possible,” an- 
swered the therapist. 

“All you have to do is let them 
know at Central Control and I’ll 
be able to take off. You must have 
my outside clothes and ID packet 
and money someplace.” 

“You realize that in a terminal 
of this size we can not be respon- 
sible for loss of property,” said 
the machine. “Theft of belong- 
ings is naturally lamentable. The 
responsibility can not be assumed, 
however, by the terminal staff.” 

“No,” said Penrose, “I’m not 
grousing about my belongings. 
Let’s go back to the fact that I’m 
only thirty four years old. I don’t 
belong here.” 

“To be sure.” 

“Then you’ll do something?” 

“You can assume that your 
problem will be given all the at- 
tention it warrants,” said the 
therapist. “I must be getting on 
to my next patient.” 

“When exactly will you let me 
know?” Penrose asked as the 
machine started to roll toward 
Carlisle’s chair. 

“Yes, yes,” it said and began 
talking to Carlisle. 

Penrose glanced hopefully at 
Harrison and the one armed man 
smiled back. 


TERMINAL 


89 


A fter lunch came sitting. Not 
in the soft chairs that had 
appeared for therapy but in stiff 
straight metal ones. 

Penrose had his hands capping 
his knees. “Essentially,” he said 
to Harrison, “the terminals are 
a positive thing. A solution to the 
problem of senior clutter.” 

“That’s the Welfare Squad 
point of view.” Harrison’s hand 
rested on his chest. 

“Those old timers who don’t 
function anymore in the highly 
overstocked urban and suburban 
complex are weeded out,” said 
Penrose. “Should it turn out that 
an individual senior citizen still 
has a valid function he can al- 
ways be reclaimed.” 

“They say the actual termina- 
tion is pleasant.” 

Looking at the red door Pen- 
rose said, “Right beyond there 
isn’t it?” 

“Yes. This is one of the wait- 
ing rooms. You can spend from 
a day to a week or more here. De- 
pends on processing.” 

After a moment Penrose said, 
“I should be back home by late 
today.” 

“You know about yourself?” 
Penrose shook his head. “Not 
entirely. I’m aware that I’m only 
thirty four. I’m in this terminal 
by mistake. All the details on my- 
self haven’t come back to ine as 
yet.” 

“Still,” said Harrison, “don’t 
you wonder?” 

90 


“Wonder about what?” 

“If this terminal has made a 
mistake. Perhaps others do, too. 
Perhaps this one has before.” 

“No,” said Penrose, “that’s 
why they have the Efficiency De- 
tail.” 

“They slipped up in your case.” 

There was a brief confusion 
because Guttenberg fell over side- 
ways out of his chair. Carlisle 
and Remmeroy righted him. 

“A system like this has to have 
a human element,” said Penrose. 
“Even though the terminal itself 
is fully automatic. The Efficiency 
Detail provides that human ele- 
ment. That’s why I know the er- 
ror in my case will be cleared up.” 

“Suppose,” said Harrison. 

Remmeroy hopped up on his 
chair. 

“I remember, I remember 
The house where I was born. 
The little window where the 
sun 

Came peeping in at morn.” 

“Suppose what?” asked Pen- 
rose. 

Harrison shrugged his armless 
shoulder. “That an Efficiency De- 
tail man came here to Terminal 
#130 to inspect. They work solo, 
you know.” 

“The budget doesn’t allow for 
teams.” 

“Possibly the last time the Ef- 
ficiency Detail man was through 
he ovei-looked a faulty rail on a 
ramp. This time as he leaned on 
it he fell and whacked his head. 


FANTASTIC 


While he was unconscious, be- 
fore the automatic staff rushed 
to help, someone might have 
switched papers with him. Some- 
one named Fowler say. By the 
time the staff gave him treatment 
for his fall and shots this Effi- 
ciency Detail man would be pret- 
ty confused. The equipment here, 
a lot of it anyway, is old and er- 
ratic and they might easily get 
him mixed up with one of these 
old fellows. One on his way to a 
termination waiting room.” 

“Oh, that’s very unlikely,” said 
Penrose. 

“I was a rich fuel speculator,” 
said Carlisle. “Before I got mixed 
up with this wild bunch here. 
Youngest fellow in my profes- 
sion. How about you?” he called 
out to Penrose. 

“I can’t,” he said, “quite re- 
member.” 

“Does it start with a W ?” 

The chairs retracted and it 
was time for naps the wall told 
them. 

Harrison frowned. “Penrose 
was with the Efficiency Detail.” 

Penrose was put to sleep be- 
fore he could say anything to 
Harrison. 

T he serving android was 
backed into a corner. 

“On the blink again,” said Car- 
lisle. 

For dinner a table had ap- 
peared. The five men were ar- 
ranged around it. 


“I’ll give it a kick,” said Har- 
rison. 

Penrose jumped up and got to 
the android first. “Would you 
please get hold of the therapist 
for me.” 

“Happy day,” said the machine. 

“Look,” said Penrose. “That 
Harrison. He’s trying to tell me 
I’ve somehow been mistaken for 
an old man named Fowler. That 
it’s this Fowler’s turn to be ter- 
minated today. That kind of mis- 
take is not going to look good on 
the records.” He touched one 
sticky arm of the enameled an- 
droid. “I don’t know, Harrison 
could be lying. He says I’m with 
the Efficiency Detail. The drugs 
you people gave me. I’m still 
fuzzy. Will you tell the therapist 
to please, god, hurry. In case it 
is true.” 

“Choice of desert,” the andy 
said. 

Remmeroy ran around the table 
and came slowly toward Penrose 
and the android. 

“The sea is calm tonight. 
The tide is full, the moon lies 
fair.” 

The old man slammed his fist 
against the machine and broke 
his hand. 

Penrose exhaled sharply. Some- 
body would have to come now and 
look after Remmeroy. Then he’d 
be able to get word out. If he were 
with the Efficiency Detail they 
wouldn’t be missing him yet. He 
only had to report in once a week. 


TERMINAL 


91 


He covered a good part of Great- 
er Los Angeles and didn’t have to 
file anything until the end of each 
work week. 

Still the Efficiency Detail might 
be wondering about him already. 
He’d been here two days now ap- 
parently. He didn’t recall a fam- 
ily. Civil servants didn’t have 
time for close ties usually. 

Remmeroy returned to the ta- 
ble. His good hand locked around 
his other wrist. He howled once 
and spun. Then sat quietly in his 
chair. 

Nothing came to help him. 

“The night nurse has some 
loose valves,” said Harrison. 
“May not eome at all tonight.” 

“I was the youngest real doc- 
tor in my home town,” said Car- 
lisle. “My hometown began with 
a D or an S.” 

Penrose cupped his hands to 
his mouth and yelled. 

The red door swung open and 
the lights in the grey room dim- 
med. 

“Sorry,” said Harrison, turn- 
ing away. 

“Nice to have met you,” said 
Carlisle. 

Two bright silver androids 
rolled out of the room beyond the 
red door. They slid over the floor 
and took hold of Penrose. 

“This is going to mean trou- 
ble,” said Penrose. 


Something jabbed his arm. 

“Now, now,” said one of the 
androids. It had the same voice 
as the therapist. “Things are 
okay.” 

“Perfectly,” added the other. 

They took him into the termin- 
ation room and guided him into 
its one straight chair. The chair, 
once his weight hit it, extended 
restraining straps around him. 

Penrose was not as clear as he 
had been. “Be sure my message 
gets through,” he said. 

The androids were gone and 
the door closed. 

There was a wet sound now. 
A waterfall it sounded like. And 
soft organ music began to fill the 
room. 

Penrose tried to remember. He 
couldn’t quite believe that Har- 
rison was right. That he was 
with the Welfare Squad, with the 
Efficiency Detail. 

It didn’t seem to him that he 
could have been a part of a set 
up like this. Not at all. 

A silver tube slid up out of 
the floor, then another. A gas 
with a faint floral odor was being 
released. 

Penrose drifted back in the 
chair. 

The room was doing a smooth 
job of termination. 

“Very efficient,” said Penrose.

FANTASTIC 


MIRANDA 


By JOHN JAKES 


The Civil War exerted a strange influence on 
fantasy writers. Ambrose Bierce uncovered a 
strange occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge. Now 
John Jakes discovers one equally strange at 
another bridge— and at the graves across it. 


I N those grim days, men became 
much less than men, and only 
something more than animals. 
This was because we had only the 
most primitive of objectives: to 
eat when we could; to sleep if 
we might; to slaughter, pillage, 
burn as much as we had strength 
and endurance to do. 

We rode and marched by day 
and by night. We lived in a daze 
of dirt, screams, fatigue, disease, 
death. On every night horizon, 
red stains seemed to signal that 
the whole state of Georgia was 
afire. Rumors ran that the Gen- 
eral, who was called Gump behind 
his back, after his middle name, 
Tecumseh, intended to bring the 
Reb government to its knees by 
devastating the land. 

On the road some days after 
Atlanta, fatigue and illness 
caught up with me. I blanked out 
for short periods of time as I 
rode, though I managed to re- 


main with my unit. Then a more 
violent spell of fever seized me. I 
fell out of column to rest. The up- 
shot was, I woke the next dawn 
to discover I had been left be- 
hind. Although I rode half the 
next night to find the 10th New 
York House, I failed. 

I was lost. I was alone in a ru- 
ral land full of trees and cabins 
where the Johnny Rebs might 
look out at me and snipe me from 
the saddle. 

After I realized I was lost, I 
rode for another day and part of 
the next night, still without suc- 
cess. I was armed — my pistol, my 
saber, and what they called a 
Texas toothpick, a big wicked 
fighting knife which a sergeant 
had swapped me, and which I had 
put away in my boot. I had no 
food. 

After a period of fever from 
which I remember nothing, I 
suddenly found myself on a cor- 


93 


duroy road at the entrance to 
a dark avenue between gigantic 
water oaks. I weaved in the sad- 
dle. The stars blurred, then 
sharpened. Otherwise the sky 
was black. The land smelled of 
dampness and the smoke of pil- 
lage. But I was so far out into the 
back country, I saw no signs of 
fires burning. 

At the head of the avenue 
a white glimmering revealed a 
plantation house. I nudged my 
weary horse toward it, for I 
thought Fd seen a lantern gleam. 
Half way up the avenue between 
the rustling trees, my horse’s 
hoofs rattled suddenly on boards. 

We were crossing a flat bridge, 
unseen in the dark. It spanned a 
bubbling creek. My horse’s left 
forehoof came down on rotted 
board. Planks creaked, snapped. 
The whole decayed center of the 
bridge gave way beneath us. 

I fell, twisting free of the 
screaming, frantic animal. I 
struck the water. It was not deep, 
but my head cracked a rock. A 
fresh lance of pain added to that 
already racking my bones. 

T he chill creek water plucked 
at my elbows. I saw my horse 
scramble up and blow noisily, un- 
hurt in the fall. If she wandered 
off, I would have no way to catch 
up to my unit. I tried to rise. I fell 
back, and all went dark. 

When I opened my eyes again, 
the aching and chill had grown 

94 


worse. My teeth rattled. Judging 
by the silence of the birds and 
the slight pall in the sky, the time 
was near false dawn. I dragged 
myself upright and clambered up 
the creek bank. 

A whinny near one of the wa- 
ter oaks showed that my horse 
had not wandered off. I lurched 
toward her, through a clammy 
ground mist which swirled and 
eddied around my boots. 

This mistiness hid the great 
house at the head of the avenue, 
except where a solitary yellow 
square seemed to glisten, as 
though a lamp were lit. I walked 
toward my horse, reached out to 
stroke her muzzle. Suddenly the 
back of my neck crawled. 

A man peered at me from the 
mist, a scarecrow-thin figure in 
sodden clothes so befouled with 
dirt, it was impossible to recog- 
nize what sort they were. His 
face was stubbled. His mouth 
hung open in a kind of wrenched 
grin. His eyes were without pu- 
pils, white as milk. 

“Give me a hand,’’ I said. 
“Where can I find some food and 
abed?’’ 

The apparition let out a low 
sound, like a moan. The mist 
drifted higher. I thought the fig- 
ure had turned and fled. I stum- 
bled after it. 

“Wait! Come back here! I’m a 
Union officer, I order you to — ” 

The words floated eerily in the 
mist. There was no one there. 


FANTASTIC 


Through my fever, I realized 
that the spectre of the pasty- 
faced man must be an hallucina- 
tion, the result of weeks of wear- 
iness, hunger, illness, of seeing 
dead men left behind at the road- 
side while Cump Sherman’s jug- 
gernaut moved across Georgia. 
But I did need help. So I cupped 
my hands to my mouth and be- 
gan to shout. 

In the echoing silence after my 
shout, I heard a door creak and 
slam. 

The exertion of calling for help 
began a new, racking pain in my 
chest. My boot slipped in a mois- 
ture-slimed rock along the creek’s 
bank. I caught a clump of shrub 
for balance. But I tumbled over, 
sprawling in the water again. 

A sibilant whisper of wind 
drifted between the water oaks 
on the avenue. Somehow, as I 
crouched on hands and knees in 
the bubbling creek, I knew that 
a person was coming toward me 
along that avenue. 

I swung my head. The mere 
exertion started my forehead 
buzzing and thudding again. I 
felt that I might blank out. As I 
made an effort to scrabble toward 
the bank, my left hand brushed 
against my holster. 

It was empty. 

Had my pistol dropped out into 
the water? I tried to peer under 
the surface of the black, swirling 
stuff. I did not see the weapon. 
Then, as fresh waves of dizziness 


washed over me, two sensations 
struck me almost together, one 
visual, the other aural. 

The first was the sight of wav- 
ering orange firedots burning 
through the mist at the tips of a 
many-branched candlestick. 

Someone was carrying the can- 
dlestick down the avenue through 
the mist. 

The noise, far out on the road, 
was the unmistakable clatter of 
hoofs and wheels. I turned to- 
ward it. 

A caisson whipped by, rum- 
bling. A squad of cavalrymen in 
blue rode behind. They wore blue 
uniforms. I was not totally cut 
off from Cump Sherman’s army 
after all ! 

I reared up in the water to 
shout. The cry never left my 
mouth. I felt new rushes of dizzi- 
ness, felt my hands slipping be- 
neath me. My face plunged back 
in the water, an instant after 
I had a macabre impression of 
a beautiful young woman, the 
many-branched candlestick held 
in her pale right hand, gazing at 
me through the mist from the 
creek bank. The candlelights 
danced and went out — 

• « « 

I WOKE with a thick, feverish 
feeling in my head and a smell 
of dust in my nostrils. I was 
staring into the burning candle- 
stick set upon a low table. Beyond 


MIRANDA 


95 


it, where darkness clotted in the 
corner of what once must have 
been a genteel parlor, a fat spider 
crawled lazily up a cobwebbing 
near the ceiling. 

These impressions, and others, 
filtered through a haze of fever, 
made me uneasy. So did the 
great, grotesque shadows thrown 
by the sheeted furnishings, and 
the thick patina of dirt upon the 
windows. In the sky outside I 
saw the last, brooding smear of 
a sunset, indicating that I had 
been unconscious most of the day. 

My hands rested on the arms 
of a high-backed chair. My boot- 
ed feet were propped on a low 
stool in front of me. I became 
conscious of both my pistol and 
saber being missing. Just then 
the saber’s blade flashed across 
my vision and hung there like a 
glittering metal bar. 

I turned my head. 

“I thought you’d never come 
round, Yank.” 

Her voice was musical but 
edged with mockery. The wine- 
velvet gown she wore had seen 
more prosperous days, like the 
house and the land. But her 
body was young and firm, and 
her chin was tilted up. 

She had a pretty mouth, sharp 
gray eyes and a long, shiny-gold 
tress of hair tied at the nape of 
her neck with common string. To 
see a Southern girl in such a 
state of disarray, holding a cav- 

96 


airy saber at my throat to boot, 
would have been an unnerving 
sight even for a man not plagued 
by fever. 

“How did I get here?” 

“Walked. I helped you some.” 

“I don’t remember.” 

“You going to make a fuss?” 
she said. 

“No,” I said. “I guess you 
could put that through my gullet 
if I did.” 

She nodded, almost primly. 
“Yes, ’twouldn’t take much.” 

“This your place ?” I asked. 

“Twelveoaks belonged to my 
husband.” 

“I don’t know where I am, ex- 
actly,” I said, eyeing that shin- 
ing strip of iron in her hand, a 
hand which did not shake by a 
fraction. “I think I picked up 
some kind of fever, and I got 
separated from my unit.” 

She continued to watch me 
steadily. “Do you have a name?” 

“Coburn,” I said. “Captain 
Joshua Coburn, 10th New York 
Horse.” 

“Riding with that devil Sher- 
man?” she said, though toneless- 
ly- 

Again I nodded. “Does that 
earn me the saber through the 
neck?” 

Slowly she raised the blade, 
examined its shining surface. 
Then, with a shrug, she laid it on 
one of the sheet-draped pieces of 
furniture. 

“It should, right enough. Ex- 
FANTASTIC 


cept I haven’t quite turned to 
acting like an animal, even 
though the Yankees who’ve been 
riding through this part of the 
country have set a fine example. 
My name is Miranda Saxby.” 

She walked a step closer, dis- 
played a gold ring on her left 
hand. “Mrs. Saxby. Or the widow 
Saxby, you could say.” 

I MUST make clear that all that 
happened between us hap- 
pened as though I saw, heard, 
took part in it while staring 
through layers of gauze. I was 
light-headed, inclined to talk 
foolishly because of the fever, 
and unable to summon up much 
energy to stir from the high- 
backed chair, even though the 
sternness of her gaze warned me 
that, because I was a Union of- 
ficer, alone and sick, she knew 
she enjoyed an advantage not 
many of her fellow-Georgians 
had enjoyed of late — a chance 
for revenge. 

As if to reinforce this idea, 
she turned and walked off a 
ways. She paused by another ta- 
ble where several dusty goblets 
and a cut glass decanter full of 
some berry wine had been laid 
out. 

“I’ve good reason to hate your 
kind. Captain, don’t think I have 
not,” she said, back turned. 

The term ‘widow’ had struck 
home a moment before. “Your 
husband, ma’am?” 


“Yes.” Her skirts rustled as 
she swung. “Shiloh Church. He 
was one of the first to die. The 
slaves have all run off, thanks to 
that monster who runs your guv’- 
mint. Down here we call him 
Linkum the Ape.” 

She laughed, a sound like bells. 
But there was little humor in her 
eyes as she continued, “We heard 
General Sherman was marching 
in this district. Most of the own- 
ers pulled out, but I stayed. I 
didn’t have a place in the world 
to go. I came from the sort of 
place where — well, it was in New 
Orleans, Captain. Some try to 
prettify the type of place by call- 
ing it a boarding school for 
young ladies. I saw men killed 
there. Gamblers, riffraff.” She 
nodded at the saber. “So I’m not 
exactly unfamiliar with how it’s 
done.” 

Chill sweat began to bead up 
on the plams of my hands, and 
upon my face as well. She un- 
stoppered the decanter. She 
poured out two goblets of the 
wine, sipped a bit of hers, then 
carried the other to me.” 

“Cherry wine,” she said. 
“Might warm you.” 

“I could use some food if 
there’s any,” I said. 

“For a damnyank, you’re 
mighty high-handed in your 
wants.” 

For the first and only time 
during the encounter, I laughed 
aloud. It came out as more of a 


MIRANDA 


97 


dry croak. “Ma’am, you’ve got no 
reason to like Union soldiers, as 
you say, and probably plenty of 
reason for disliking them. So I 
figure you’ll either make things 
easy for me or kill me, with no 
inbetween.” 

Miranda smiled. “That’s a 
fact.” 

“So which is it? Food or the 
sword through my neck?” 

S TANDING there a foot or so 
in front of me, the wine gob- 
let catching the lights of the 
candlestick and reflecting them 
in odd little sparkles in her eyes, 
she grew tense. She extended the 
goblet, yet did not offer it fully. 
A door creaked somewhere. I had 
a wild, foolish pang of fright. 

I wished just then, for no clear 
reason, that the clattering cais- 
son I’d seen on the corduroy 
road had wheeled in. 

It is not right to say I felt 
afraid of the Reb widow, yet I 
did. Consider it this way. I was 
not afraid of what I saw, namely, 
a beautiful, hungry, defeated 
woman who had me at her mercy 
because I was feverish and weak ; 
I was afraid of something about 
her I could not see, but only 
sensed. 

“There’s plenty of reason for 
me to hate Yankees,” she repeat- 
ed softly. 

“I’m sure there is.” 

“Don’t pretend you hate all 
this burnin’ and killin’.” 


“Relive whatever you want, 
but I don’t enjoy it.” 

“Three of them, a sergeant 
and two corporals — they rode in 
here a week ago.” 

“Ours?” 

“What else?” 

“What did you give them?” I 
asked. “Wine or the sword?” 

I’d spoken rashly, trying to 
humor her. The wine goblet glit- 
tered a she threw it against my 
face with great violence. The im- 
pact of the glass didn’t matter 
much. But the droplets running 
down through my beard had a 
nauseatingly sweet stink, and 
seemed to sting and burn. I 
rubbed them away and the back 
of my hand seemed to sting for a 
time afterward, too. 

“They used me,” Miranda said 
in a whisper. “They hurt and 
used me.” 

Silent, I watched her. I won- 
dered why she was taking on so. 

“The word for it in New Or- 
leans,” she said low, “is rape.” 

Again I was unsure about the 
proper reaction. Certainly an in- 
mate of a ‘boarding school for 
young ladies’ could not have been 
all that repelled by such an act. 
It must have been the fact that 
she and they were partisans of 
different causes that produced all 
the pent-up hate I heard seeth- 
ing in her voice. In any case, her 
quickly-formed fists decided me 
against commenting on that as- 
pect of it. 


98 


FANTASTIC 


“There are scum in all arm- 
ies,” I said. “In any army, there 
are scum.” 

She appeared to compose her- 
self a little. She shook off a light 
shudder and retrieved the gob- 
let, which somehow had not 
broken when it fell to the floor. 
As she poured more wine, she 
said over her shoulder, “That’s 
bound to be the way you Yanks 
will explain it. Well, there have 
been enough others stopping by 
since.” 

W HILE I was still wondering 
about that odd remark, she 
brought me the glass. 

“Here.” 

“I’ll ride out as soon as I’m 
able,” I told her. 

“Frankly, Captain, you don’t 
look very damn able.” 

She almost smiled again. And 
somehow, in the merry cast of 
her mouth, I thought I saw one 
of those little miracles which 
give the lie to the warmongers 
who say the Rebs are monsters to 
a man, or that we are, for that 
matter. Ill-used by some of Sher- 
man’s scavengers, she was still 
human enough not to kill me out- 
right. I had some dim, preten- 
tious hope or other that, after 
the bloody conflict was done, peo- 
ple like Miranda Saxby — people 
even like myself — might bind up 
the wounds. 

I sipped some of the wine. She 
did also. Then I said: 


“Yes, I’m worn out. I could en- 
joy a night’s rest.” 

“Won’t Butcher Sherman miss 
one of his officers ?” 

“I’ve been gone a night al- 
ready. One more hardly mat- 
ters.” 

“Well,” she said thoughtfully, 
“I can give you a bed. But first 
some food. Wait.” 

She vanished through a cur- 
tain. The house creaked in si- 
lence. Outside, full dark had 
fallen. 

An owl hooted in the distance. 
A whisper of chill air brushed 
against my cheek. I swung my 
head. I felt, rather than saw, 
someone at the edge of the par- 
lor, there in the dark. 

I knew I must pull myself up 
out of the chair. I did, stagger- 
ing. The saber lay a great dis- 
tance away. Almost against my 
own will, I looked around. 

The same ghastly white-eyed 
creature I had glimpsed down by 
the creek stood in the wide door- 
way which led from the hall. Be- 
hind him, other hideous figures 
stirred, unseen except for glim- 
mers of empty white eyes. 

The right shoulder of the be- 
scummed, pale white apparition 
in the doorway displayed a tat- 
tering of dirty gold. What was 
it? I pounded my brains, but 
they were too thick with fever 
for me to quite grasp at the an- 
swer I wanted. 

But I was filled with a terror 

99 


MIRANDA 


beyond anything I had ever ex- 
perienced. 

The thing there in the parlor’s 
entrance had bloated, paste- 
white cheeks. Down those cheeks 
ran crooked blackish lines which 
some inward sense told me were 
tracks of blood, long dried. 

The figure lifted its grimed 
hands, as though reaching for 
me. It made a sound with its yel- 
low-toothed mouth, a sound 
which could only be transcribed 
as a guttural groan something 
like, “Urrrrghhh-uh.” 

The other horrors behind it, 
three or four of them, it was im- 
possible to tell, took up the plaint 
until the ghastly moaning, 
though not excessively loud, 
seemed to press on my ears with 
actual pain. 

A S I stared, the mewlings of 
the things standing there 
intensified. I almost had a feeling 
that, rather than menace, they 
represented some kind of warn- 
ing. The spectre nearest me 
i*eached out toward me, and all 
reason slipped away. With a ter- 
rified curse I blundered after the 
saber, picked it up, whirled 
around and drove it as hard as I 
could, straight into the befouled 
jacket of the creature approach- 
ing. 

Candlelight seemed to flare up 
white. I felt an impact through 
the blade. Blinded, I reeled away 
a step. 

100 


When the dazzle faded, I saw 
my saber impaled in the wood- 
work of the great door, vibrating 
faintly. It had passed through — 
nothing at all. 

The apparitions were gone. 

Cold sweat rivered down my 
cheeks as I dug my knuckles into 
my eyes and strove to keep from 
falling. Was I mad? Was I so 
sick that I saw phantoms ? 

I started back to the high- 
backed chair, accidentally knock- 
ing against the table bearing the 
decanter. As I made a vain effort 
to prevent it, the decanter tipped, 
crashed to the floor. 

The stopper flew out. The 
cherry wine leaked onto the 
pegged planking. I watched a 
tiny wisp of smoke curl up, then 
another. The wine seeped down 
through the cracks between the 
planking, leaving a wide, ugly 
scar upon the wood. 

“Did you see something, Yan- 
kee?” 

Her muted voice spun me 
around. She watched from 
the curtain, where she had ap- 
peared suddenly and silently. 
She carried a small tray on 
which rested a butt of gray, 
mold-tinged bread. I swallowed 
the bile taste of fear and said: 

“I’m not certain. There was a 
man — several men, so it looked 
like.” 

“Fever dreams?” she asked, 
amused. 

“They were too real for that. 

FANTASTIC 


One had a patch of gold at his 
shoulder.” 

Miranda’s golden hair gleamed 
when she nodded. She set the 
tray aside as if it were no longer 
necessary, as if pretense were at 
an end. Her gray eyes pierced 
mine. 

“Yes, Captain Coburn, he was 
a full Colonel.” 

Then I knew : 

“His uniform — all fouled with 
filth. It was a blue uniform.” 

“That’s right, Captan. He was 
a Yank. Since a week ago, since 
those first three men came by 
late one night — ” The softness in 
her face vanished, to be replaced 
by an angular, blinding fury, as 
her voice dropped and came 
buzzing through the fever: “ — 
since then, others have stopped, 
hunting food, or rest, or an avail- 
able woman for their brute appe- 
tites. Four of them have come. 
Captain, two together, two sep- 
arately. And I served them each 
a bit of wine. Here, come to the 
window. Your bed is ready.” 

I TOTTERED half way across 
that shadow-thick chamber be- 
fore the awful pain began to 
twist my belly. I doubled over, 
tumbling across the high-backed 
chair. 

Cramped in that awkward po- 
sition, I saw her lift a moldering 
yellow curtain. Outside, near the 
window of the plantation house, 
moonlight gleamed on a patch of 


black dew-slimed sward. Four 
small piles of rocks glistened, 
each at the head of a hump of 
earth. Yawning beside the 
mound on the right was a fifth 
freshly-dug open grave. 

Somehow I got my hand down 
to my boot where the hideout 
knife was stashed. I drew it 
though it felt lead-heavy. Mi- 
randa Saxby laughed and let the 
curtain fall. 

“ ’Twon’t do a bit of good on 
me. Captain, the same as it didn’t 
on them when they came in a 
while ago.” 

God help me, somehow I knew 
she was right. 

The motions she made were all 
the more evil because she at- 
tempted to mock the provocative 
as she turned her back toward 
me while her hands worked at the 
sash of her gown. 

“I want you to rest well in 
your bed. Captain. I want you to 
be warm and comfortable in your 
bed, so that’s why I mean to 
come into your bed to warm it. 
At least for a while, anyway, ’till 
you settle in for a long rest. 
Don’t fret, it won’t be so bad.” 

Abruptly, she dropped her 
gown so that, as she stood with 
her back toward me, she was 
bare to the waist, except for 
where the soft skin was hidden 
by the gold banner of her hair 
hanging down. Over her shoulder 
she looked at me with the eyes of 
hell itself. 


MIRANDA 


101 


“Most men, even Yankees, 
think Fm pretty. Captain. Don’t 
you ?’’ 

The flesh of her back showed 
three round, crusted, black bul- 
let holes. 

For what I did then there can 
be no apology, no moral justifi- 
cation, save that I knew I faced 
evil beyond comprehension. I 
lurched forward and stabbed the 
knife into her back, up to the 
hilt. 

No blood appeared, not a drop- 
let, not a stain. Over her shoul- 
der, like some ghastly coquette, 
Miranda Saxby looked at me 
with the toothpick sticking from 
between her shoulder blades, just 
above the bullet wounds, and she 
laughed merrily. 

If not exactly a brave man, I 
had never fled from weapons 
fired in anger. But I fled then, 
summoning the last vestiges of 
my fever-sapped strength. I 
turned and fled with a cry, past 
the table with the candlestick 
which I knocked over. 

I staggered through the 
haunted hallway, beating on the 
outer door until I sprung it open. 
I stumbled from the porch, 
smashed my jaw in the dirt as I 
fell, but somehow managed to 
get up and continue running, 
down the avenue between the wa- 
ter oaks. My stomach wrenched 
and I was sick, my system rid- 
ding itself of the poison by vio- 
lent spasms. 


At last I stumbled again and 
sprawled out, wondering if the 
wine would still kill me or only 
drug me, wondering, wondering 
if I would die this night. The 
ground on which I fell crawled 
with eerie radiance. 

Lying in the avenue, I twisted 
over. The candlestick had fired 
the place. Flames leaped behind 
the dusk-thick windows. I heard 
a single, awful, piercing shriek. 
Then my mind received the 
blackness again with a full wel- 
come. 

A UNION corporal from Ohio, 
scavenging the neighbor- 
hood for provisions in company 
with a small, tuft-whiskered 
turncoat Georgian named Han- 
no, discovered me. 

I learned later that they had 
been loading grain into a wagon 
at a cabin roughly a mile up the 
corduroy road when the flames 
in the sky drew their notice. I 
wakened with my back propped 
against one of the water oaks as 
dawn was breaking. The few 
timbers of Twelveoaks still 
standing were black, smoking 
fingers poked upward to a leaden 
sky. It had burned to the founda- 
tions. 

Shaken, uncertain of what I 
had seen or experienced the 
night before, I said little to my 
rescuers at first, drinking from 
a canteen and gnawing on a 
hunk of jerky until the Ohio cor- 


102 


FANTASTIC 


poral pressed me for details. I 
laid aside the canteen, still feel- 
ing feverish. There was a fierce 
ache in my belly. But I felt a pe- 
culiar certainty that I would 
recover because what had trans- 
pired in that house last might 
was worse than any illness ever 
conceived by man, save perhaps 
war. 

I carefully falsified a story in 
a cracked voice : 

“I rode into this avenue late 
last evening. When that bridge 
yonder gave in beneath me, I 
think I crawled to the creek 
bank.” 

“You was a-lyin’ right in the 
middle of the avenue when we 
come on you, sir,” said the cor- 
poral. 

“Then I must have crawled 
there. I was in a daze, I don't 
remember. Except — ” This much 
I had to ask, the man Hanno be- 
ing a resident of the neighbor- 
hood. “ — I thought that once a 
woman looked out of the window 
of that house. A young, yellow- 
haired woman. Perhaps the own- 
er’s wife. I can’t explain how the 
fire started, but — did you see 
anything of the woman this 
morning?” 

Hanno tugged at his whisker- 
tufts. “Just dreams, sir.” 

“What?” 


“Mrs. Saxby, bless her soul — 
she was killed last week. Now 
I’m not criticizing you Yankees, 
sir. No, sir, you’ve treated me 
mighty fine, mighty fine indeed.” 
The Ohio corporal snorted in 
contempt, turning his head as 
Hanno went on. “ — but some ele- 
ments in the soldiery, well — it 
was three enlisted men, air. 
Union enlisted men, I regret to 
say. They reined in at Twelve- 
oaks late one night, asking for 
provender. I gather they took a 
shine to Mrs. Saxby because — 
well, sir, one of the slaves lived 
long enough afterward to tell the 
tale. First the Union enlisted 
men — ah — forced their wills 
upon Mrs. Saxby, a poor widow 
lady. Then, because they’d been 
drinking, these particular sol- 
diers, well — they lined Mrs. Sax- 
by and the four slaves still faith- 
ful an’ staying with her up 
against a wall of the house and 
shot them all in the back. Then 
they rode about the neighbor- 
hood boasting of it, until they 
moved on. Some of us citizens in 
the district, we buried them all. 
Yes, all five, a week ago.” 

So the crux of it then became, 
who occupied those graves? In 
truth, I did not especially want 
to learn.

Qarpet Treatment 

By ROBERT LiPSYTE 


A story with a moral for airline 
travelers. Or is it an im-moral? 


“THIS IS YOUR PILOT, DUB TO 
CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND YOUR 
CONTROL, THIS AIRCRAFT WILL DE- 
SCRIBE A HOLDING PATTERN FOR 
THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES, 
THEN ASCEND TO HEAVEN. QUALI- 
FIED PASSENGERS WILL BE AL- 
LOWED TO DISEMBARK. THANK 
YOU.” 

I T was the fat priest with the 
cigarette holder who spoke 
first, sputtering through a 
mouthful of purple grapes he 
was eating out of his pocket, 
“What the hell kind of joke is 
this?” 

A little boy began to cry be- 
cause his mother looked worried, 
and a young man and his younger 
wife squeezed each other’s hand. 
The tourist section of the plane, 
where they all sat, was crowded, 
but quiet. 

Up front, in the first-class sec- 
tion, a stubby man with hairy 
hands and a monogrammed pink 


shirt twisted toward the blonde 
in the window seat. “Must of 
been a crash. Puff. This is it.” 

A thin, tanned man with a 
manicured moustache sitting be- 
hind them leaned over. “What’d 
you say. Max?” 

“I said we must of got knocked 
off.” Max patted the blonde’s arm. 
“Don’t worry. Puff, just fix your 
face. Whatever happens, just let 
Poppa do the talking.” 

When the stewardesses did not 
move or fasten smiles on their 
lacquered faces, the passengers 
began to look at each other, and 
then to talk. There were twenty- 
one people in first-class and fifty- 
eight in tourist and their voices 
became suddenly loud as the en- 
gine noises faded. The fat priest 
had swallowed his grapes, un- 
buckled his safety belt and 
stepped out into the aisle. 

“This is not comical,” he said, 
“This is foul blasphemy, and a 
cruel joke.” 


105 


A gray-haired lady with bright 
blue eyes pulled at his black 
sleeve. “Oh, Father, what Glory, 
we are being transported, gath- 
ered into His Arms, as it were.” 

“As it were, as it were,” mut- 
tered the priest, sitting do^vn 
heavily, on the metal buckle. 

Up front, the man with the 
moustache tapped Max on the 
shoulder. “Will it go hard. Max, 
you think it’ll be bad?” 

“Relax, Charlie, you can never 
tell about these things.” Max ran 
his thick fingers up Puff’s arm, 
but the blonde was repairing her 
mascara. 

Tw’o rows ahead, a portly man 
in a blue suit was slipping a soft 
hand inside his shirt and under 
his left breast, and breathing 
hard. His wife, a thin woman 
with the face of a headache, 
said; “Think about all those 
Sunday mornings you played 
golf, Harry.” 

The young couple in tourist un- 
derstood now and smiled at each 
other. “I’m glad we waited, dar- 
ling, aren’t you glad we waited ?” 

“It was worth waiting for,” he 
said. 

“That’s not what I meant, dar- 
ling, I mean we did everything 
right and now . . .” 

The gray-haired lady started 
to chant, “Bless me. Father, for 
. . .” but everyone around her 


began to call to the priest and 
pluck at his sleeve. He lurched 
into the aisle again, spitting 
grape seeds, and ran to the lava- 
tory. It was occupied. 

“Mommy?” whimpered the 
little boy, and his mother smiled 
and caressed his hand. 

“You’ll be with Daddy soon, 
you’ll be with . . .” 

Suddenly, the engines cut off 
completely and the plane began 
to climb. 

“Soon, soon,” cried the gray- 
haired lady in tourist, almost or- 
giastically, and the young couple 
smiled and kissed the air near 
each other’s cheeks, and the 
mother held her son tightly and 
three young women near the gal- 
ley crossed themselves and the 
priest was on his knees, his head 
against the locked lavatory door. 

There was great quiet in first 
class. The portly man had 
slumped against the window and 
Max folded fifty dollars into 
Puff’s hand. “We might get sepa- 
rated baby.” 

The plane landed, and the in- 
tercom crackled again. 

“THIS IS YOUR PILOT. WE HAVE 
LANDED IN HEAVEN. ALL FIRST- 
CLASS PASSENGERS WILL DISEM- 
BARK. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE 
CONTINUING WITH US, PLEASE 
MAKE SURE YOUR SEAT BELTS ARE 
FASTENED. YOU MAY SMOKE.

Typewriters, pumpernickels, sabertooth tigers, solidified

I By 

I HAROLD STEVENS 



1&98 A.D. A team of French 
archaeologists broke through the 
wall of an abandoned mine and 
found themselves in a veritable 
treasure-house of prehistoric re- 
mains, Paintings of reindeer, 
buffalo, and wild horses covered 
the walls. A crude stone fireplace 
in the center of the cave con- 
tained bits of charred wood. 
Nearby was a human skeleton, 
every bone whole and undam- 
aged. Tools, weapons, and domes- 
tic utensils were neatly arranged 
along one wall, a silent testimon- 
ial to paleolithic standards of 
housekeeping. Among these ob- 
jects was a heavy black ball 
which, upon close inspection, re- 
vealed the inscription: 

KELLY’S ALLEYS 
ALL-NITE BOWLING 
Subsequent laboratoi'y tests 
showed the ball to be at least one- 
hundred thousand years old. 

8S6 A.D. A knight in armor, 


out for adventure in the English 
countryside, was knocked from 
his horse by a typewriter. It came 
flying through the air from no 
place, struck him a glancing blow 
on the head, and disappeared. His 
helmet saved him from serious 
injury. 

3000 B.C. An Egyptian prin- 
cess, dallying in her scented bath, 
looked up to find a fully dressed 
man sitting in the tub with her. 
She shrieked, shot out of the wa- 
ter like a porpoise, and bolted 
from the room. The man sat in 
the water, his thick eyebrows 
locked in fury, a cigar butt 
clamped between his teeth. “Dam- 
mit!” he muttered — and dema- 
terialized. 

15,000 A.D. A charge of 
fraud was brought against a dis- 
tinguished dealer in antiques. 
Visitors to his gallery inadver- 
tently stumbled upon a wooden 
crate full of “antiques” that 


107 


looked suspiciously new. One of 
the items, a primitive electric 
hand-iron, bore the trademark of 
Westing & Howes, a famous ap- 
pliance manufacturing concern 
that flourished in ancient times. 
Obviously a fake, the article had 
apparently just been made, and 
was now awaiting the clever touch 
of an unscrupulous expert to give 
it the appearance of a geniune 
antique. 

500 B.C. A Roman emperor, 
feeling himself being anointed a 
little ahead of schedule during 
coronation, looked up and discov- 
ered a battered, filthy can of 
PRIDE - OF - PENNSYLVANIA 
motor oil precariously balanced 
in the rafters above. 

1890 A.D. A son was born to 
George and Mary Klobbet. To the 
utter amazement of the attend- 
ing doctors and nurses, the child 
arrived with his eyes wide open 
and an enigmatic smile on his 
face, his little fingers twisting 
the umbilical cord into the word 
“Hello.” In a burst of inspiration, 
the parents named him Merlin. 

160,000,000 B.C. A large, hun- 
gry pterosaur, cruising at five 
hundred feet along the coast, 
caught the glitter of sunlight re- 
flecting from the scales of a school 
of fish in the water below. He 
wheeled gracefully, poised for a 
moment perfectly balanced, his 
wingtip resting precisely on a 
point of air, then shot straight 
down, legs and wings swept back 


along his body. He was plunged 
ing like a javelin when suddenly, 
seventy-five feet above the waves, 
a stale loaf of pumpernickel ap- 
peared in his path. With a squawk 
he threw out his wings in a fran- 
tic attempt to brake, but it was 
no use; he was moving too fast, 
and a split-second later the can- 
non-ball shape was firmly impaled 
on his long, pointed snout. The 
body came to a dead stop in mid- 
air, crumpled like an accordion, 
then pumpernickel and pterosaur 
together windmilled into the sea. 
The splash scattered the school of 
fish, but they streaked back in an 
instant. Two minutes later the 
pterosaur’s immaculate skeleton 
came to a gentle rest on the bot- 
tom. The oumpernickel, still af- 
fixed to the snout, had survived 
the attack without a scratch, but 
several dazed fish still swam limp- 
ingly in the vicinity trailing 
wisps of blood from their torn 
mouths and broken teeth. 

1900 A.D. The scientific world 
is agog at the incredible inven- 
tion of a ten-year-old New York 
boy by the name of Merlin Klob- 
bet. The boy — obviously a genius 
— took an ordinary box camera, 
made some obscure adjustments, 
and produced what he calls an 
“aremac”. This device is a sort 
of camera in reverse. The oper- 
ator clicks the shutter in the us- 
ual way, but the picture, instead 
of forming inside the contrivance 
— as it does in a camera — “ma- 


108 


FANTASTIC 


terializes” on the surface of the 
subject itself. If the subject is a 
person, he simply steps back out 
of his picture — which is a full 
color replica of the exposed side 
— and that’s that. The picture re- 
mains standing there. There are, 
however, several disturbing fea- 
tures to these photo-statues. First 
of all, they obtain their color di- 
rectly from the subject, lifting 
off every bit of pigmentation in 
skin, hair, eyes, clothes — like de- 
kals. The unfortunate subject is 
left completely bleached on the 
side that was exposed. The condi- 
tion is thought to be permanent. 
The second disturbing feature is 
that these photo-statues are in- 
destructible, despite their mil- 
lionth - of - an - inch thickness. 
What’s more, they are firmly 
welded to whatever they happen 
to be standing on. A photo-statue 
taken of someone standing on 
the sidewalk could be removed 
only be digging up the cement 
and carting away statue and side- 
walk together. “There are many 
additional reasons why I am im- 
pounding this “aremac” contrap- 
tion,’’ the police commissioner 
stated in an interview, “but I 
won’t go into them now — except 
to ask you to imagine what would 
happen if just one lousy busload 
of tourists got loose in this city 
taking those damn pictures!” 

1810 A.D. Dozens of confused 
and frightened residents of a 
small, wealthy community just 


outside of Boston converged on 
their church in order to pray, and 
perhaps to receive a divine ex- 
planation for the series of inex- 
plicable events that had occurred 
simultaneously an hour earlier. 
These were the events : 

Spinster Hortense Morrissa 
Haggleston, respected Tory and 
pillar of the church, had just 
eased herself and, with a com- 
placent sigh, was decorously ris- 
ing from her chamber-pot when 
she happened to glance down. She 
screamed and fainted. Fortunate- 
ly she fell backward across the 
bed, and not on top of the infant 
who lay cooing on the floor be- 
tween her feet. 

The Honorable Judge William 
A. Bortwright sat down with his 
famliy for their evening meal. He 
was justifiably pleased with him- 
self, having had a good construc- 
tive day on the bench. He had 
sentenced three vagrants to long 
jail terms, imprisoned one editor, 
banished a War of Independence 
veteran from the town for “indis- 
creet imbibing of alcoholic bever- 
ages”, and had a seventeen-year 
old girl flogged for kissing her 
lover in public. Now, while say- 
ing grace, he modestly took the 
opportunity to beg of God that 
He cast an approving glance upon 
his (the judge’s) good works by 
blessing their humble repast. 
Amen. They all looked up to find 
Spinster Haggleston’s chamber- 
pot, sloshing full, in the middle 


JUNKMAN

of the table. Simultaneously, the 
maid rushed in, panic-stricken, 
to announce that the baby had dis- 
appeared. 

A farmer sat down to milk his 
cow, and reached for her udders 
only to find his arms immersed 
to the elbows in a tureen of beef 
stew. “Elsie?” he whispered, in- 
credulously, “Is this youV’ 

The pastor’s wife walked out 
of the kitchen to wake her hus- 
band for dinner. She never made 
it. Instead she found herself 
clinging for dear life to the very 
top of the meeting-house spire, 
A second later her husband woke 
up to find himself in bed with a 
cow. The general nature of the 
other events can easily be sur- 
mised. 

1900 A.D. When ten-year old 
Merlin Klobbet was informed of 
the police commissioner’s deci- 
sion to impound his “aremac”, he 
had a tantrum to end all tan- 
trums. He screamed and gnashed 
his teeth, he tore out clumps of 
hair until his scalp bled, he 
clawed at his face and ripped his 
clothes, he threw himself down, 
writhed convulsively, kicked his 
heels on the floor, and banged his 
head repeatedly against the legs 
of the furniture. 

500 A.D. The round table fell 
silent as King Arthur reached up 
with great dignity and plucked 
the pale-green bottle from the top 
of his bejewelled crown. All sat 
breathless as Arthur studied the 


smeared, sticky object. Presently 
he turned to one of the knights 
beside him and said, “Pray, tell 
me, good Sir Galahad — knowst 
thou the meaning of this legend 
here inscribed? ‘Coca Cola’?” 

1901 A.D. Pandemonium 
reigned in Brewster Auditorium 
last night. The main selection of 
the concert was to have been Gus- 
tave Rauchlitz’ daring new “Bat- 
tle Symphony”. The work, fa- 
mous for its bombastic qualities, 
is scored for two machine-guns, 
one small cannon, an exploding 
powder-keg, and a thunder mak- 
ing machine of the composer’s 
design, in addition to the usual 
full orchestra. Before the first 
movement was half finished, the 
terrified audience was frantically 
clawing its way out of a forest 
of gigantic, weird sculptures that 
had suddenly sprung up all over 
the auditorium. Several people 
were injured in the crush. An 
eleven-year old boy, who was seen 
leaving the concert with a sus- 
picious-looking bag under his 
arm, was detained for question- 
ing. He denied having any con- 
nection with the events of the 
evening. When questioned about 
the contents of the bag, he opened 
it and proudly showed the police 
an object that looked like a cyl- 
inder with an ear-trumpet at- 
tached. He said that it was a 
“Transmogrifyer”, and that he 
had made it himself. He explained 
that it converts sounds into beau- 


110 


FANTASTIC 


tiful, solid forms. He identified 
himself as “Merlin Klobbet, the 
greatest inventor in history.” 

1902 A.D. Extract from a re- 
port read at an annual staff meet- 
ing at Clearhead Sanitarium, a 
mental hospital in upper New 
York State. 

“Patient was placed in our 
custody one year ago as a re- 
sult of his involvement in the 
famous Brewster Auditor- 
ium riot. Has shown no im- 
provement to date. Has fre- 
quent temper tantrums, and 
does not get along with other 
patients. He amuses himself 
by playing with a peculiar 
little machine that produces 
delightful, three-dimensional 
abstract figures when he 
sings gently into it. He refers 
to himself as ‘Merlin the mir- 
acle-maker.” 

50,000 B.C. The saber-tooth 
and the Neanderthaler faced one 
another on the narrow ledge. The 
tiger’s muscles were tensed for 
the spring, and the man stood 
with his heavy club raised over 
his head, ready to deliver a crush- 
ing blow. The tiger leaped, and 
the man — disappeared. The ti- 
ger’s claws and teeth slashed 
through empty space, and its mo- 
mentum carried it over the ledge 
and down into a thornbush. It 
staggered away bloody, mewing 
pitifully, to become the first vege- 
tarian cat in history. The Nean- 


derthal man somehow ended up 
in Rome, almost fifty-thousand 
years later, where he was cap- 
tured, tamed, and eventually be- 
came the outstanding gladiator 
of the day. 

1930 A.D. “Patient neither 
improves nor deteriorates. 
Condition has remained un- 
changed during the entire 
twenty-nine years that he 
has been with us. Spends all 
his time producing strange 
inventions. Latest creation is 
a putty-like substance that 
changes its atomic structure 
instantly when middle C is 
played on the piano. Patient 
showed us how it works. In 
the space of five minutes, to 
the accompaniment of the 
one note played over and over 
again, this lump of stuff 
changed — in rapid succession 
— into a puddle of water, a 
piece of lead, a bar of soap, 
a pile of ashes, a cube of 
bronze, a slab of rubber, and 
a quivering chunk of proto- 
plasm. Patient says it is im- 
possible to tell in advance 
what this substance will turn 
into, but he ‘has hopes’ ”. 

1810 A.D. Dozens of confused 
and frightened residents of a 
small, wealthy community on the 
outskirts of Boston finished their 
prayers and were leaving the 
church. They had just reached 
the bottom steps, when they were 
engulfed in a blinding storm of 


JUNKMAN 


in 


garbage. They stood petrified, 
and for a full minute were sav- 
agely pelted by chicken bones, 
pieces of moldy cheese, slices of 
salami, rotten tomatoes, banana 
peels, etc. The cloudburst was 
over as quickly as it had begun, 
and the people hastened back into 
the church to pray again, with 
renewed vigor. 

19JtO A.D. “Patient Klobbet 
has escaped from Clearhead. 
Another patient claims to 
have heard him at the piano 
playing the same note he’s 
been playing for the past ten 
years. According to this wit- 
ness the music stopped, after 
which there was a minute of 
dead silence. Then Klobbet 
■was heard to yell, T got it ! I 
finally got it. Goddammit! I 
got it I got it I GOT IT!!!’ ” 

19^1 A.D. The underworld is 
buzzing with the story of how 
Pedro Scondrilla, quasi-legal in- 
ternational fence, paid five-mil- 
lion dollars in cold cash for the 
biggest diamond in history. Scon- 
drilla says that he doesn’t know 
the seller’s name, or who he is, 
but that he checked thoroughly 
before he put up the dough and 
everything is legitimate. “This is 
a one-hundred percent straight, 
clean deal,’’ he told reporters, “to- 
tally and completely on the up 
and up. I don’t know who the guy 
is — he’s kinda weird, I admit — 
but that is positively not a hot 

112 


rock. You got my word for it,, and 
you can ask any cop or dealer in 
the whole (censored) world if ya 
don’t believe me.” 

194-2 A.D. A tall, cadaverous 
man, with wild eyes and unkempt 
hair entered a bowling alley near 
Peekskill, and sought out the 
owner, a Mr. Clarence Kelly. “Mr. 
Kelly,” he said, “I’m interested 
in renting the vacant cabin be- 
hind your bowling alley.” 

“What did you say your name 
was ?” Kelly asked, looking at the 
man with obvious distaste. 

“My name,” the man said, shov- 
ing out his bony chest, “is Mer- 
lin the mir . . . — ah. Merlin 
Klobbet.” His words came muf- 
fled around a wet, weedy cigar, 

“Marvin Corbett?” Kelly said. 

“As — yet. Look, Mr. Kelly, I 
need the place. To store a few 
things, and — there’s some work 
I have to do, you see. I’ll pay you 
a good price,” 

“Well . . Kelly rubbed his 
chin doubtfully. This guy looked 
like a real odd-ball. A character. 
But, then again, the alley had seen 
better days. He weakened. “You 
sure you want it? It’s just a junk 
house, you know. Anything we 
don’t need, that’s where it goes.” 

“It’ll be only temporary,” Klob- 
bet said. 

“O.K.” Kelly said. “It’s yours. 
Fifty a week in advance, and you 
gotta move the junk out your- 
self.” 

Klobbet was ecstatic. He slap- 
FANTASTIC 


ped five one-hundred dollar bills 
into the amazed Kelly’s hand. 
“This should do for a couple of 
months,” he said, “and there’s 
lots more where that came from.” 
He dashed off to the cabin, leav- 
ing an acrid trail of smoke be- 
hind. “And don’t worry,” he 
shouted back over his shoulder, 
“I’ll take care of that junk.” 

Early that evening Klobbet 
went out and returned with a 
huge carton loaded with assorted 
tools and hardware. Next morn- 
ing a truck arrived and deposited 
a load of lumber at the door of 
the cabin. Klobbet came out rub- 
bing his hands with delight, paid 
the driver, and hauled the lumber 
into the cabin singing in a loud, 
tuneless voice. 

■pvURING the month that fol- 
-L' lowed, the usual thumpings 
and rumbling' of the bowling 
alley were intermixed with the 
sounds of hammering, sawing, 
and wire-snipping. This went on 
day and night, punctuated irreg- 
ularly by brief periods of silence 
during which Klobbet either ate 
or slept. He left the cabin once 
every few days to shop for food 
at a supermarket nearby. The 
delicatessen counter was his fa- 
vorite haunt in the store, and 
after a while, the area around 
the cabin developed a highly dis- 
tinctive odor that was a blend of 
spiced meats, pickles, smelly 
cheeses, sauerkraut, and cigars. 


Kelly’s curiosity got the better 
of him one day, and he stopped 
Klobbet outside the cabin. “Look, 
Mr. Corbett,” he said hesitantly, 
“I know it’s none of my business, 
but what the hell’s going on in 
there?” 

Klobbet glanced around fur- 
tively and clutched the shopping- 
bag to his chest. Somewhere in- 
side the bag a half-pound of 
corned-beef yielded up its juices, 
and greasy spots began to appear 
on his trousers. Without answer- 
ing, he made off toward the cabin 
— then stopped. He stood still for 
a moment, thinking, then turned 
back to Kelly with a sly expres- 
sion on his face. “Come on in,” he 
said, “I’ll show you.” 

Kelly stood in the dim light, 
breathed the foul air reluctantly, 
and looked around with revulsion. 
The place had always been a mess, 
he remembered, but — nothing like 
this. The room was cluttered with 
machine parts, tools, bits of half- 
consumed food, old soiled clothes, 
brimming cans of garbage — 
we^s old and stinking, card- 
board cartons of dusty, nonde- 
script rubbish, piles of unmen- 
tionable offal — a veritable mu- 
seum of dry-land flotsam and jet- 
sam. 

“This place looks and smells 
like a damn dump,” Kelly said. 
“When the hell are you gonna 
clean it out?” Squeamishly, his 
gaze traveled through the room, 
resting as briefly as possible on

each disgusting object. Then his 
eyes stopped, locked in place. He 
had discovered the box. Klobbet’s 
facial muscles began to twitch 
with anticipation, and his cigar 
began to shuttle excitedly from 
side to side in his mouth. 

The box was a large, open, 
crate-like affair, decorated with 
a bizarre confusion of wires, 
tubes, and switches. It looked like 
an out-size coffin wired for sound. 
Kelly walked around it, im- 
pressed and mystified at the same 
time. No words came; he simply 
stared the question at Klobbet. 
Klobbet licked his lips with a 
trembling tongue and cleared his 
throat. “It’s a time machine,” he 
said softly. 

Kelly looked at his tenant as 
though he were seeing him for 
the first time. Klobbet stood there, 
a slovenly fierce-looking man, 
gray hair disheveled, a tattered 
cigar waving in his mouth. “You 
don’t believe me,” he said tight- 
ly. “You think I’m lying.” He 
stepped forward, jerkily, his 
hands stiffening into talons. Dan- 
ger hung in the air like an invis- 
ible thunderhead. 

“A kook,” thought Kelly. “A 
real, genuine nut.” He glanced 
around for a possible weapon and 
quickly settled on a bowling-ball 
which he snatched from a pile of 
discarded alley equipment. Klob- 
bet continued advancing, a look 
of the purest malevolence twist- 
ing his face. Kelly brought the 


ball up, holding it protectively be- 
fore him, took a step backward, 
tripped over something, and top- 
pled into the box. He lay there 
for a moment, dazed, still holding 
the ball and looking, for all the 
world, like a bowling champion — 
in all his glory — about to be laid 
to rest. The next-to-the-last thing 
he heard was Klobbet’s victory 
whoop as a lever was slammed 
down somewhere. The very last 
thing he heard was a flurry of 
guttural, grunting voices. Then 
a stone axe cracked open his 
skull, and there was nothing. 

l^LOBBET danced around the 
empty box like a drunken 
gnome, beside himself with joy, 
“It worked !” he chattered. “The 
first try, and it worked ! Magnifi- 
cent Merlin did it again ! !” 

Fifteen minutes later he was 
not so happy. Something was- 
wrong with the mechanism. 
Sometimes the things he put in 
it would disappear, presum- 
ably coming to rest somewhere 
in the vast continuum of time. 
Other things went and came 
right back again. And there were 
things that appeared unbidden 
— from God knows where or 
when. Klobbet shivered with 
fright at the recollection of the 
ape-man who had started out of 
the box to attack him, but had 
accidentally touched a tube that 
instantly sent him back into the 
time-stream.

FANTASTIC 


He glowered reprovingly at 
the box, as though it had delib- 
erately, spitefully, tricked him. 
Then he took a screwdriver and 
made some adjustments. When 
he was satisfied, he rummaged 
through a pile of junk and came 
up with a stained and scarred 
toilet-seat. He placed this in the 
box and pulled the lever. The toi- 
let-seat vanished, and he gave a 
tentative sigh of relief. A few 
seconds later he set the dial on 
“RETURN” and pulled the lever 
again, but nothing happened. 
Then suddenly the box began to 
tremble and heave, and in an- 
other moment it lurched and 
spewed forth a load of fish that 
spread out in a wriggling carpet 
at his feet. He began to kick at 
the fish wildly, then slipped and 
fell, sending them flopping all 
over the room. He tore at his hair 
in frustration and, hissing a 
stream of poisonous curses, pro- 
ceeded to shovel the fish back in 
the box with his bare hands. 
When he was finished, he stood 
up shaking with rage, scales 
shimmering in his hair, one fish 
tail waving feebly from a pocket. 
As a final gesture, he flung his 
cigar into the box, hawked a 
huge gob of phlegm after it, and 
slammed down the lever. Every- 
thing went, and didn’t come 
back. 

He sat down, lit a fresh cigar, 
rested for a moment, then grimly 
seized the screwdriver and went 


to work again. Presently there 
was a blinding flash, and Klobbet 
fell back on his haunches, gazing 
blankly into the box. It was sput- 
tering and sizzling, wires were 
jerking, and switches snapping 
themselves on and off. Deep 
within the recesses of the box 
scenes began to appear, dimly 
and jerkily — making Klobbet 
think of the “flickers” of his 
youth. He thought he saw a 
farmer milking a cow, a family 
at dinner, a lady on top of a 
house, and other similar, domes- 
tic scenes. Everybody seemed to 
be in early nineteenth century 
costume. He was just getting in- 
terested, when the box gave a 
convulsive shudder and stopped. 

T he scenes faded. Klobbet 
yanked some wires and twist- 
ed some tubes, but nothing hap- 
pened. In a state of growing anx- 
iety, he grabbed a hammer and 
started to pound the box merci- 
lessly. Still nothing happened. 
“Idiot machine!” he shrilled, 
and, with tears of frustration 
filling his eyes, hurled the ham- 
mer into the box and gave it a 
vicious kick for good measure. 
The box rumbled protestingly 
and belched out a dinosaur egg. 
Klobbet ducked, and the egg 
struck the opposite wall, broke, 
and slithered to the floor leaving 
a slimy trail behind. The box was 
silent now. 

For several minutes the in- 

115 


JUNKMAN 


ventor and his creation faced 
one another, each waiting to see 
what the other would do next. 
Tentatively, Klobbet regarded 
the box. He studied the wiring 
briefly, changed a fuse, and bent 
over to peer inside. Suddenly it 
was as though a monster vac- 
uum cleaner had been turned on. 
Klobbet was sucked into the box 
with a loud “vthloop”! Five sec- 
onds later he was spat back into 
the room — ^water pouring from 
his clothes, reeking from wet ci- 
gar and exotic perfume, and 
quaking with fury. “Fiend!” he 
croaked at the box. “Imbecile! 
Abortion! You’ll be sorry you 
were ever invented ! !” 

Then he went completely mad. 
He took a wrench and beat the 
lever permanently into the “ON” 
position, then he began to pile 
everything he could get his 
hands on into the box. A case of 
empty Coke bottles went in flrst. 
This was followed by a type- 
writer. Next went the day’s deli- 
catessen purchases; then a dis- 
mantled radio, a loaf of stale 
pumpernickel, an empty oil can, 
and a crate of broken household 
appliances — in rapid succession. 
The box was having trouble di- 
gesting everything at once. It 
made plaintive, gagging noises. 
Delighted, an expression of Sa- 
tanic glee lighting his features, 
Klobbet redoubled his efforts and 
jammed into the box a bundle of 
filthy clothes, a pair of ragged 


sneakers, and — for a crowning 
touch — the overflowing garbage 
pails. The box was heaped moun- 
tain-high with churning refuse. 

Eventually, somehow, the box 
lay empty again, wheezing pain- 
fully and giving an occasional 
strangled gasp as sudden con- 
strictions attacked its inner cir- 
cuits. “Satisfied?” Klobbet gloat- 
ed maliciously. Then, chuckling, 
he delivered the coup de grace. 
He tore out the wires one by one, 
smashed the fuses and condens- 
ers, and splintered the delicate 
crystals into millions of tiny 
slivers. 

Calmer now, sated with re- 
venge, Klobbet thought about 
the half hour that had elapsed 
since Kelly had entered the cab- 
in. In that short space of time 
he had personally, singlehanded, 
launched aeons of time-borne 
debris. At this very moment, 
empty beer cans, cigar butts, 
dirty socks, and soiled under- 
wear were floating simultaneous- 
ly past the noses of brontosauri 
and through the sterile streets 
of anti-gravity suburbs. An in- 
credible feat — spreading rub- 
bish up and down through all 
eternity — and he had done it 
alone ! Himself ! Merlin The 
Most ! ! 

The victor stood and contem- 
plated the body of his van- 
quished foe. It was all over now

By WALTER F. MOUDY 



“Men, Vm here to give you the scoop. The 
straight scoop.” The man who is talking in 
the lingo of our profession is dark and serious. 


T he speaker’s name is Slim 
Jim. He is just twenty-four 
years old, but already he is a 
veteran too old for active duty. 
There is a wild, unholy look in 
his eyes which tells you even bet- 
ter than the scars on his face the 
hell he’s been through. Yet his 
hands are steady and his voice 
firm as he continues what is to 
be the first of a long series of 
indoctrination lectures. 

“I don’t know why you men 
signed up, and I’m not going to 
ask. Perhaps you got into a little 
trouble at home. Perhaps you 
were disappointed in love. What- 
ever the reason, that’s your busi- 
ness. We don’t ask questions 
here. The important thing is that 
you’re here, and it’s my business 
to teach you what you have to 
know to stay alive. Some of you 
will not live to complete your 
tours. The ones who make it may 
owe your lives to what you’re go- 
ing to learn these next few 


weeks. So pay attention. Your 
instructors are tough, hardened 
veterans. You will do well to lis- 
ten to them.” 

“Tell us, man,” we say. “Give 
us the clue.” 

“The enemy is cunning, and 
ruthless and outnumbers you a 
thousand to one. They possess an 
almost suicidal courage. They 
never sleep. Their spies are ev- 
erywhere. Their communications 
system makes a modern radio 
look like a child’s toy. The enemy 
will ambush you when you least 
expect it — and they take no pris- 
oners ! Let me repeat, gentlemen: 
They never take prisoners.” 

I’ll never forget the chill that 
runs down my spine at these last 
words. For the first time I am 
scared. I mean really scared. Oh, 
I’ve seen the newsreels, and I’ve 
read the papers. But it doesn’t 
seem real somehow. You always 
figure it won’t happen to you. To 
the other guy maybe — but not to 


■ 117 


you. You’re on top of the world, 
and nothing bad can happen. But 
this is different than just reading 
about it. I mean Slim Jim has 
been there. He’s faced them, and 
he’s lived to tell about it. For the 
first time I begin to wonder if it 
is worth it. 

I remember that wonderful 
feeling I had the day I signed 
up, that “wonderful things are 
bound to happen” feeling that 
sets the blood to racing with the 
promise of adventure and excite- 
ment. Of course, mom was bawl- 
ing like I was already dead, and 
dad had that tight set look on his 
face like he was at a funeral or 
something. He kept saying, 
“Now, mother, he’s old enough to 
know his own mind.” But his 
voice was thick, and I knew he 
was taking it harder than she 
was. Down deep, I mean. 

I remember the night before I 
left my girl friend, Ella, came 
over to say good bye, and for 
the first time she really kissed 
me. I mean — really kissed me. It 
was great. Just great. Cloud nine 
stuff. If you’ve ever gone to war, 
you know what I mean. It seems 
to affect girls that way. 

But now as I listen to the quiet, 
matter-of-fact lecture by Slim 
Jim, I realize I am not immune. 
Yes, it could happen to me. In 
just a few short weeks our group 
has to be ready to face them. I 
look at Jo Jo, Ko Ko, and Bo 
Bo, the other members of my 


group, and I can see they are 
scared too. It is a solemn mo- 
ment. 

S IX weeks later we open in Des 
Moines, Iowa. And there for 
the first time we see them. Teen- 
age girls! Hundreds of them. 
Girls in skirts and sweaters. 
Girls in bobby socks and two- 
tone shoes. Smart girls and dull 
ones; girls from suburbia and 
girls from the slums. Girls chew- 
ing gum and girls with glasses. 
They fill the air with their 
shrieks and screams ; they create 
thunder with their feet. They fill 
the hall with an excitement that 
is so real you can almost reach 
out and touch it. And their nails 
glisten blood red in the reflected 
light. 

We hit ’em with everything we 
have. Electric guitars and drums 
are all set for maximum amplifi- 
cation. We don’t hold back. We 
open up with Pagan Baby and 
then swing right into Panther 
Lady. What I mean, we are a 
swinging group. We face them, 
and we leave them in the aisles. 
We can’t do anything wrong to- 
night. Jo Jo and his Jungle 
Rhythm Boys are a big success. 

Oh, I don’t mean we aren’t 
scared. Anyone would be scared 
standing up there on that lighted 
stage in full view, knowing that 
there is nothing between you and 
them but a few flimsy floodlights 
and a half dozen ineffectual po- 


lls 


FANTASTIC 


licemen. You try to tell yourself 
that they are just normal teen- 
age girls like you see everyday 
on the street, but you know it 
isn’t so. Tonight they are the en- 
emy. You can hear it in their 
thin, shrill voices; you can see it 
in their wide, bright eyes; and 
you can feel it in the rhythm of 
their beating feet. 

We wind up our first show with 
Congo Congo. That’s the one 
where Jo Jo advances to the front 
of the stage and sings the melody 
while the rest of us give him a 
chanting jungle background. It 
has a tricky six-four beat that 
really sets ’em back. Half way 
through the number about thirty 
girls charge the stage. You have 
to hand it to Jo Jo. The guy has 
guts. He doesn’t lose a note. He 
just leans back and belts it out 
with all he has. He hits them 
square in the face with rhythm 
amplified twenty times. The ad- 
vancing line wavers, then breaks. 
Fourteen girls faint. We know 
now we have won our first en- 
gagement. 

We hardly have any trouble at 
all this first night in leaving the 
theater. Jo Jo has managed to 
get a copy of the city sewer line 
plans, so we simply slip into a 
manhole in the darkened alley be- 
hind the theater and come out 
four blocks away. 

W ELL, we meet them head-on 
in Kansas City and we lay 


them in the aisles in St. Louis. 
In Cincinnati we knock ’em dead. 
We are a swinging group with 
lotsa rhythm amplified twenty 
times. We are learning fast — and 
so far we are lucky. Except for 
minor scrapes and bruises and a 
few torn clothes we haven’t had 
a casualty. By the time we get to 
Chicago we are big time. Now 
our training will be tested. 

We come into Chicago by 
barge and check into our hotel. 
We have leaked word to the press 
that we would be arriving by 
plane at O’Hare Field, but we 
know they will have the other 
public transportation systems 
watched too. So while two thou- 
sand girls battled two hundred 
uniformed police at the airport, 
we are safely checked in at our 
hotel. The hotel, of course, has 
installed bars on our windows, 
stationed guards in the corri- 
dors, and removed all moveables 
from the lobby. For the moment, 
then, we are comparatively safe. 

Jo Jo goes over the plan of 
operations. “Men,” he says, “I 
have here a detailed plan of the 
auditorium, the connecting sew- 
ers, and the surrounding terrain. 
You will notice this open ground 
here on the north side of the au- 
ditorium. There is some cover, of 
course, here on the west ; but, un- 
fortunately, if we use the west 
entrance, we will have to cross 
this exposed street.” 

It looks bad. We can all see 

119 


1 THINK THEY LOVE ME 


that. •‘How do we get in?” I ask. 

“Plan C,” Jo Jo replies. 

There is a momentaiy silence. 
Plan C means we'll have to dis- 
guise ourselves as girls, which, 
with our hairdos, means we’ll 
simply put on dresses and lip- 
stick. “Yes,” Jo Jo continues, 
“Plan C. We’re big time now, and 
we gotta take our chances. Ko 
Ko, you’ll be the swing man. 
We’ll work our way through the 
crowd as close as possible to the 
west door, and then you’ll yell as 
loud as you can, ‘There they are ! 
There they are! Over there!’ We 
can’t hope to move against the 
flow of the crowd, but we can pre- 
tend to faint and take our chanc- 
es on being trampled. As soon as 
they’ve moved away from us, we 
all make a break for the door at 
the count of three. At the count 
of three. Got it, men ?” 

“Got it,” we say. 

“Now for the withdrawal,” he 
says. “Disguise is out of the 
question, and the .server lines 
leading from the auditroium 
aren’t big enough. We’re going to 
try something new. We’re going 
to sing our way out !” 

He pauses to let that one sink 
in. “Yessir, we’ll march right 
through their middle in a direct 
frontal assault with the amplifi- 
ers on full blast. When we reach 
the exit — ” He pauses again. 
“When we reach the exit, gentle- 
men, we’ll run like hell.” 

It’s a good plan. It’s so simple 


like most good plans are. It 
might have worked, too, if Ko Ko 
hadn’t gotten careless. We get in 
just like we’d planned with noth- 
ing more than a couple of cracked 
ribs and a few miscellaneous 
bruises and contusions. We put 
on our show, and then as we be- 
gin our finale, we start walking 
straight down the aisle dragging 
our extention cords behind us. 
They are so near we can reach 
out and touch them with our bare 
hands. Jo Jo is leading the way 
while Ko Ko is protecting the 
flank. We are only twenty feet 
from the rear exit when it hap- 
pens. Ko Ko stumbles. He recov- 
ers quickly, but it is too late. 
Somehow he has disconnected the 
extention cord for his electric 
guitar. He has lost his amplifica- 
tion! 

W HAT happens next will be 
forever etched in my mem- 
ory. Thei’e is nothing we can do 
to save him. We have to stand 
helplessly by and watch it hap- 
pen. They moved in screaming 
for a lock of his hair, a piece of 
his shirt — anything. I’ll say this 
for Ko Ko, he is going down 
fighting, strumming his dead gui- 
tar to the last — although he sure- 
ly realizes it is hopeless. He dis- 
appears in a scrambled sea of 
faces, arms, and legs and fingers 
which glisten blood red in the 
reflected light. Poor Ko Ko is 
never to be seen again. 


120 


FANTASTIC 


My first reaction to Ko Ko’s 
death is surprising. I am glad he 
is dead. Yes, glad. Glad it is him 
instead of me. Later, of course, I 
feel guilty about having felt glad 
— until Jo Jo explains that this is 
normal. In fact, he admits, he 
feels the same way himself. I 
feel better after that. 

But somehow the group isn't 
the same without Ko Ko. We go 
on, naturally. The show has to go 
on. But it just isn't the same 
without Ko Ko. 

We get a replacement, a young 
kid fresh out of training who 
thinks a sewer is for rats and 
that tear-away shirts and tear- 
away pants are for cowards. I 
figure he’ll last two weeks. Two 
weeks is all I give him. 

I get a letter from Ella — the 
first one in a long time. It begins, 
“Dear John . . .” My name isn’t 
John, and something snaps in 
my mind. Could she have meant 
the letter for someone else? It 
drives me crazy thinking about 
it. 

Our next show is Yankee Sta- 
dium in New York City. The real- 
ly big show — maybe even a full 
thirty minutes. We arrive at the 
stadium a day ahead of time and 
headquarter beneath the band- 
stand until the following evening. 
Hour by hour we can feel the big 
stadium filling up. We are sur- 
rounded, but at least we have 
reached the stage. 

Jo Jo explains the escape plan. 


We will use a helicopter. It will 
be another first for Jo Jo. The 
guy’s always thinking, always 
two steps ahead of the opposi- 
tion. 

Hour by hour the pressure 
mounts. The great stadium is 
overflowing. Already the screams 
of the crowd are blotting out all 
other existence. The group we are 
to follow finishes its act. Against 
our wills we peek out from our 
hiding place beneath the band- 
stand. The Cover Boys are 
mounting an armored tank and 
trying to wedge their way 
through the crowd. 

“The fools !’’ Jo Jo murmurs. 

We watch as a hundred unhur- 
ried hands overturn the tank and 
spill its contents onto the fresh 
green earth of the stadium. We 
wonder if grass which has tasetd 
blood will ever again be satisfied 
with water. 

Something breaks inside me. 
“I’m not going ! I’m not going up 
there!’’ I cry. 

Jo Jo slaps my face. “Shut up,” 
he says. “Get hold of yourself, 
man.” He slaps me again, softer 
this time. “We are all depending 
on you,” he adds as the tears 
come to my eyes. 

He turns to the others. “Now 
check your amplifiers, and let’s 
get up there.” 

I don’t say ansrthing. The oth- 
ers are looking at me strangely. 
Then I have this sudden inspira- 
tion. I don’t know why I haven’t

thought of it before. Of course. 
That had to be the answer. “Tm 
all right now,” I say shyly. I am 
too. It’s so simple once you figure 
it out. 

We go onstage. There must be 
over eighty-thousand of them out 
there. But I’m not scared. Not 
any more. As we do the show, I 
notice Jo Jo glancing up to 
make sure the helicopter is still 
hovering overhead. Jo Jo is al- 
ways so very careful. But it’s all 
so unnecessary. I mean. I’ve fi- 
nally figured it out. I think they 
love me. 

Think about that for a mo- 
ment. 


We do our last number, and 
the helicopter lowers on sched- 
ule. Jo Jo and the others try to 
force me aboard, but I won’t go. 
I can’t bear to think of disap- 
pointing eighty-thousand ador- 
ing fans. Why they’d give any- 
thing just to touch me, just to 
have a piece of the clothes which 
I wear, or a lock of my hair. How 
can I disappoint these nice kids. 

I am all alone now except 
for eighty-thousand affectionate 
youngsters who are shouting 
their love for me. It’s good to be 
loved. 

And here they come!

FANTASY BOOKS 

By ROBERT SILVERBERG 


Worlds of Weird, edited by Leo 
Margulies. 158 pages. Pyramid 
Books, 504 . 

Here is the second of what I 
trust is going to be an infinite 
series of paperback anthologies 
from the files of the legendary 
fantasy magazine, weird tales. 
Seven more stories, drawn from 
the fertile 1932-1939 period when 
Farnsworth Wright was still in 
editorial command, make up this 
new volume. 

If it doesn’t quite match the 
high level of its predecessor, 
that’s not a serious fault in view 
of the standard set the first time 
out. The most powerful story in 
this volume is “Valley of the 
Worm,” by Robert E. Howard — 
a little-known non-Conan item 
set in a world of Norse mythol- 
ogy. Connoisseurs of rugged 
prose will relish such high mo- 
ments as this, as the hero-nar- 
rator launches his climactic at- 
tack on the worm-monster: 

“The spongy skin yielded and 
gave beneath my feet, and I 
drove my sword hilt-deep, drag- 
ging it through the pulpy flesh, 
ripping a horrible yard-long 


wound, from which oozed a green 
slime. Then a flip of a cable-like 
tentacle flicked me from the ti- 
tan’s back and spun me three 
hundred feet through the air to 
crash among a cluster of giant 
trees.” 

They don’t make monsters like 
that any more — or heroes, for 
that matter. 

Another good one is Edmond 
Hamilton’s “He That Hath 
Wings,” which should help to dis- 
pel the belief that thirty years 
ago Hamilton was capable of 
writing only formula space- 
opera. This story is moving and 
sensitive, with a depth of emo- 
tion rarely found in the pulp 
stories of that era. Clark Ashton 
Smith’s “Mother of Toads” is a 
lovely little chiller, less vocabu- 
lary-bound than most of Smith’s 
work. And David H. Keller’s de- 
ceptively simple “The Thing in 
the Cellar” is still good for a 
shudder or three even now. 
Frank Belknap Long’s “Giants 
in the Sky,” though minor, is a 
science-fiction story whose imag- 
ery is often rewarding to the 
reader. 


123 


The two longest stories in the 
book attempt more, and are not 
entirely successful at it. Seabury 
Quinn’s famous Christmas story, 
“Roads,” has many admirers, and 
I do not feel diposed to criticize 
it; it tells the story of a North- 
man named Klaus who is present 
at Bethlehem and at Calvary, and 
who survives to take on a role in 
Christian mythology himself. 
Quinn’s prose is worthy of his 
theme, and the notion of a wor- 
shipper of Odin kneeling before 
the infant Jesus is superb, but I 
am troubled by anachronisms in 
the story and by the fact chat 
Quinn lapses too often into cine- 
matic cliches that mar an other- 
wise flawless accomplishment. 
The last story is Nictzin Dyalhis’ 
“The Sapphire Goddess,” and I 
found it hard to enter its mood 
of whimsy. 

Virgil Finlay has contributed 
black-and-white illustrations for 
the book, most of them ruined by 
horrendous reproduction. A par- 
ticular highlight is Sam Moskow- 
itz’ brief introduction, which 
tells of the founding of wexrd 
TALES and provides information 
I’ve never seen in print before. 

The S 3 Tithetic Man, by Theo- 
dore Sturgeon. 17 U pages. Pyra- 
mid Books, 50^. 

Before the first issue of fan- 
tastic appeared, Ziff-Davis used 
to publish a magazine called fan- 
tastic ADVENTURES, thick and 


ragged-edged and full of improb- 
able tales. In the February, 1950 
issue of that defunct magazine 
there appeared a complete novel 
called “The Dreaming Jewels,” 
by Theodore Sturgeon, whose 
opening paragraph has rarely 
been rivaled for sheer audacity. 
It read: 

“They caught the kid doing 
something disgusting out under 
the bleachers at the high-school 
stadium, and he was sent home 
from the grammar school across 
the street. He was eight years 
old then. He’d been doing it for 
years.” 

The reader who survived that 
trumpet-call found himself en- 
meshed in a fantasy-world of al- 
most uncomfortable vividness. 
The backgi'ound was carnival 
life, and most of the characters 
were freaks, but Sturgeon never 
played it for pure horror, nor 
lapsed into the sentimentality 
that seems to engulf Bradbury 
whenever he approaches similar 
themes. The result was one of 
Sturgeon’s most successful nov- 
els, wholly unforgettable. Some 
time later it appeared in book 
form under its present less 
evocative title, and here it is in 
a third printing with a hand- 
some new Schoenherr cover 
painting. 

There aren’t many fantasy 
novels that match the wild poetry 
and fevered invention of this 
one. Get it.

FANTASTIC 


The Spot of Life, by Austin 
Hall. 187 pages. Ace Books, kO^. 

Last time out I dumped some 
bricks on the goofy, ill-written 
novel to which this is the sequel, 
“The Blind Spot.” Not at all 
sui’prisingly, Ace has now pro- 
duced the companion volume. A 
bit to my mystification, I find 
that it is both better and worse 
than the first. 

“The Blind Spot” was written 
by Hall in collaboration with 
Homer Eon Flint, and scarcely 
makes sense from one paragraph 
to the next. The present book, 
which dates from 1932, is the 
work of Hall alone. It is much 
more orderly : the prose is gram- 
matical, if drab, and the story 
line progresses neatly toward its 
conclusion. That’s the trouble, 
too. “The Blind Spot,” for all 
its monumental flaws, had a kind 
of breathless foolishness about 
it that made it fun to read, if 
you can find fun in watching 
authors working close to the line 
of illiteracy. There is no such 
fun in “The Spot of Life,” which 
plods along from step to step in 
the unraveling of its dreary mys- 
teries. It’s much shorter, missing 
the baroque overelaboration of 
the earlier book, and lacks even 
the feeble spark of life that one 
had. 

Convention Annual No. 3. Dis- 
con Edition, 1963, edited by Jay 
Ka/y Klein. 103 pages, $2.50. 


Inclusion of this item here is 
justified by the fact that it’s a 
pictorial account of the 1963 
World S-F Convention, held in 
Washington, D.C. As anyone who 
has ever attended one knows, a 
convention is an experience of 
pure fantasy, and so this is a 
fantasy book if there ever was 
one. 

Jay Kay Klein is a deft man 
with a photoflash, who gets all 
over a convention, recording it 
all on film without ever seem- 
ing to intrude on the scenes he’s 
immortalizing. This bulky vol- 
ume has 284 photos of the con- 
vention, well reproduced. Each of 
them has a lengthy descriptive 
caption, revealing an unexpected 
comic flair on Klein’s part. (He 
has some good fun with Hans 
Stefan Santesson, takes cheer- 
ful pokes at Sam Moskowitz and 
John Campbell, and slyly nudges 
Cele Goldsmith Lalli once or 
twice.) Aside from those nota- 
bles, you’ll find photos of every- 
one else who was on hand, both 
at the formal sessions and at 
the not-so-formal — including the 
likes of Isaac Asimov, E. E. 
Smith, Forry Ackerman, Murray 
Leinster/Will Jenkins, Edmond 
Hamilton and Leigh Brackett, 
Emsh, James Blish, Judy Merril, 
Frederik Pohl, and a few hun- 
dred others. The masquerade 
party is well covered, though 
some of the masqueraders aren’t.

The First Men in the Moon, by 

H. G. Wells. 160 pages. Ballan- 
tine Books, 504. 

Wells is now going into the 
public domain in this country, 
and paperback editions of his 
works spring up on all sides. 
This one, written more than 
sixty years ago, is being reissued 
in connection with its release as 
a motion picture, “in Dynama- 
tion and Lunacolor” — a fact that 
might have startled its author a 
bit, if he had been able to look 
forward from the turn of the 
century to see its ultimate fate. 

The story ought to be familiar. 
It’s the one about the English 
gentlemen who build a spaceship 
covered with an anti-gravity 
metal and float off to the moon, 
which is populated and involved 
in turmoil. It’s fine fun, and 
Stanton Coblentz has rewritten 
it only thirty times so far, so 
the original is worth examining. 
Don’t mistake it for science-fic- 
tion, though. It’s pure fantasy, 
as even Jules Verne grumbled 
long ago.

— except for one last thing. Yes, 
even an enemy was entitled to 
a decent burial. He wrestled the 
box through the back door and 
dragged it out to a creek that 
flowed several yards behind the 
cabin. “Revenge is sweet,” he re- 
flected as he slid the box into the 
water. It filled quickly and sank. 

Klobbet didn’t even have time 
to grasp the significance of the 
wide, deep whirlpool that sud- 
denly formed on the surface of 
the water — because he disap- 
peared. His unoccupied clothes 
remained standing rigidly for a 
brief moment — as though they 
were being displayed by an in- 
visible mannikin — then they col- 
lapsed in a neat pile. The whirl- 
pool was gone, too.

basement. He was a self-styled 
“inventor” who spent all his time 
designing and building odd con- 
trivances. This hobby was en- 
couraged by the hospital’s offi- 
cials since it kept him harmlessly 
busy and out of trouble. He had 
been allowed to use the basement 
as an experimental laboratory. 
Another patient, who saw the 
whole thing through a cellar 
window described the terrifying 
event : “Klobbet was standing at 
his workbench, when all of a sud- 
den the basement was full of wa- 
ter. Just a kind of deep, gurgly, 
‘gwoosh’ and it was full. Just 
like that. He never had a chance. 
The water flushed him right off 
his feet, turned him every which 
way, sideways and upside down, 
getting him all tangled up in his 
own arms and legs and clothes. 
It sure doesn’t take long to 
drown.” the end
