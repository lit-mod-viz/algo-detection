Some N0t€s About This Edition

The Plot Genie /ndex was originally published in 1931 by The
Gagnon Company in Hollywood, California.

The text of this beak is taken from the Plot Genie Supplemental
Formula No, 3 Detective-MyStery First edition 1933.

Hill referred to his cardboard spinner wheel as 3 “Plot Robot.”
An aspiring author was instructed to turn the device a certain
number of times, to select a random number (usually between 1
to 180). Plot Genie users then consulted the lists to arrive at all
the elements Hill believed necessary for a fully realized plot.

Bold Venture Press will have additional materials on its website
for Plot Genie enthusiasts. A downloadable “Plot Robot," which
can be assembled by eager authors, will be available. We are
examining the possibility of offering professionally manufactured
“Plot Robot” wheels for authors who prefer a more polished
touch.

Several “Random Number Generators" are online. These
websites make an excellent substitute for the Plant Robot.
