PLOT GENIE ROMANCE

such features as one does not expect to ﬁnd making up the face of a
steward on an Italian linen He was tall and spare, and his ex
pression was one of ﬁxed gravity. He seemed unaware of the
presence of the couple he served, and it was as if he were preoc’
cupied with some problem which rode his thoughts to the exclusion
of other things, so that his actions seemed automatic and aloof.
Scattergood cleared his throat.”
Here is an ﬂlus‘tration of where an author has described a very grave and
digniﬁed and withal a ‘mysten'ous young man through the eyes of another
Character.

“I’m so sorry.“ He looked down at her miserably, truly dis,
tressed because she had suffered, and at the same time annoyed that.
her common sense had not intervened to save them both this unnec
essary and unreasonable strain."

Sympathetic, considerate, but discriminating and cautious.

“Mary," said Ed softly, “we‘re home!” I'm so glad!" Bride and
groom, these two. And this, their homecoming. A “soddy,” their
honeymoon palace! But in that hour, instead of thinking themv
selves the poorest pair of sweethearts on earth, as well they might,
they looked once more into each other‘s eyes, and laughed aloud.
They knew that they loved each other, and they had courage, The
land might be bitterly poor, but they would do their bit, and in one
way or another—they would come through!“

Here, the author combines the description of a situation and delineation of
Character With two people who are loyal, humble, sincere, optimistic and
true.

“His jaw set in stubborn lines, and his eyes narrowed. He didn‘t
care whether they liked him or not. Couldn’t he take care of him’
self? Hadn’t he managed without auyone‘s help for forty years?
He nodded, telling himself these things. Yet he realized only too
well that he did not mean them. He had wanted their cooperation,
but he‘d never ask for it—not by word or action.“

Seifrreh‘ant and independent but thoughtful.
