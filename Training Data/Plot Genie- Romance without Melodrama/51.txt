PLOT GENIE ROMAN CE

The School teacher, sitting on the platform back of the altar drops her
eyes. She is shocked at his revelations, she believes him to be drunk, and
she is not sure either of her love for him nor his love for her. Perhaps it
is another woman he means! T he Gambler‘s eyes bum her, his words are
apparmtly directed to her, yet- 5he does not move.

If he cannot have her, the Lord shall not have him! He‘ll keep the
Town and make it the haven of all those Who do not repent!

From out the tent tabernacle he stumbles. To hell With the School
teacher, and to hell With- the schoolhouse, standing there in the moonlight,
mocking him.

In his mental struggle he snatches a handful 0f thorns and crushes
them in his hand. Dry, like tinder, they are! He thinks of the dry brush
all around the schoolhouse, now deserted, and of the brisk Wind that is
blowing. In a few minutes that reproach could be wiped out. There
would be nothing on that hillside but a patch of black, like a scar on his
memory.

He drops a match. It ignites the dry brush and ﬂames roar toward the
schoolhouse. Laughing madly he stancls aside to view the destruction.

Then, out of the moonlight, ljmned against the glare, something White
ﬂashes. It is the School teacher going to the schoolhouse shrine to pray
alone. When she perceives the ﬂames sweeping down upon her, she runs,
terriﬁed, toward the schoolhouse instead of away from it!

The Gambler thinks quickly. He can save her! ' He takes off his frock
coat and wets it in the little stream, then dashes into the inferno.

He wraps the coatabout her and escort; her through the ﬂames. She.
has escaped, almost unharmed, but he succumbs to his bums.

In the ﬁnal scene she and the Evangelist come to his bedside to pray.
He repents, asking the Evangelist to pray for him, and as the man’s head is
bowed, the Gambler takes his hand and places it over that of the School
teacher.
