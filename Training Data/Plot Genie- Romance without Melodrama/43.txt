PLOT GENIE ROMAN CE

couple of fellows or members of the crew of the yacht, to get aboard. The
patty might proceed at length until the cad discovers the Captain‘s Daughv
ter dancing with a strange man. In fact, he may be tipped 01? by the girl
Friend who has the insincere, gushing, but discerning disposition. There
might follow then a situatican wherein the cad creates such a scene that the
Captain’s Daughter jumps overboard in an attempt to swim back to land.
It would be necessary to give the Lifeguard some heroic action at this point,
so we might have him deliver a smash 0n the jaw of the cad and then
jump overboard to the rescue of the girl.

As always happens in every interesting love aﬂair, there is a threatened
estrangement 0r sepamtion. The Genie tells us that in this case it is
brought about by the beloved being injured by accident, and, as a matter
of fact, that is what suggested our having the girl jump overboard. There
are many ways in which we could have her injured. She might become
entangled in the boat‘s propeller or by striking an old dredge shovel or be
bitten by a shark. This might then be followed by a serious illness in which
her life is threatened, and I can see another big situation in the climax
which is suggested by the Genie—whereby love is Won or lost by the
sacriﬁce of health. A blood transfusion becomes necessary to save the life
of the girl. The cad offers money, but not his own blood. On the other
hand, the Lifeguard, as per Genie suggestion, sacriﬁces his health by giving
up a goodly supply of blood which saves the life of the girl. In the meant
time some interesting by/play could be a situation which develops between
the cad and the Captain in which the former seeks to use his position of
authority to coerce the father into inﬂuencing his daughter, and the
reactions of the father under this pressure could be made very interesting.

Now we have just ﬁgured a way in which this romance suggested
by the Genie outline could be developed With a happy ending. It could
also be made to end in a tragedy with the death of the Lifeguard caused by
his sacriﬁce of bload fur the girl. However, in order to make a, satisfactory
story out of such an ending, it would be necessary to go back and build up
some sympathy for the Heir by showing that he was not a bad fellow at
heart but merely spoiled. It wouid also be necessary in such a case to make
