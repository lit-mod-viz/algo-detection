it and suppresses the desire to take the girl in his arms. He walks home
with her, but. is evasive about his identity.

Many times thereafter he meets her at the schoolhouse and walks with
her through the desert twilight. His yearning for her grows, and as it
grows, so does doubt intensify itself in the heart of the School teacher.
Can this charming young man he one from the Restricted District?

When the Gambler is on the verge of confessing and renouncing his
profession for love, an Evangelist comes to town. The Evangelist is a
school mate of the. School teacher’s and their friendship is renewed. For
the ﬁrst time in weeks the schoolhause 1's deserted when the Gambler
arrives.

Heartbroken he turns back to the smokerﬁlled halls and plunges madly
into the game. He will clean up the town—he’ll own every inch of it, the
schoolhouse included.

In the midst of the game a member of the Bvangelist‘s party steps
timldly into the gambling hall. “Give a little of your winnings to the Lord,"
he pleads.

An idea ﬂashes into the Gambler‘s mind, and he takes aside the Emr
ployee of the Evangelist. Yes, many souls in this wicked town have been
saved. Yes, the School teacher has publicly taken her vows. Yes, there
is a likelihood that she will accompany the entourage as the Evangelist’s
wife. Yes, it would be a great honor for him, the Employee, to save a
soul so blackened as that of the Gambler‘s.

With the Employee the Gambler stumbles across the rocky hillside to
the tent of the Evangelist. In his haste he has plunged through the 61137,
thorny brush and waded across the blackish stream that drains the mine.
When he arrives, he is tattered, bleeding, and muddy.

Halt the prayerf He, the greatest of all the sinners in the Mining town,
will give his life to the Lord with one provisiOn, and that is, that the
woman Whom he loves will take her place by his side! He will give all he
owns~~-and he has that night won the town—if that woman will come up
and lead him to the altar!
