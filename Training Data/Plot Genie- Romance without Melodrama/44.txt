PLOT GENIE ROMANCE

the difference in rank between the Lifeguard and the Captain‘s Daughter
so great that a union between them would be undesirable if not impossible.
This might be done by making him of a diﬂerent race or in some other way
disqualifying him insofar as rank is concerned. It would also be necessary
at a point near the end; of the story to put the Hair “over the hurdles,“ or
to punish him for his past thoughtlessness and make him do something
worthwhile to win the girl.

In the preceding paragraphs I have taken my reader or student behind
the scenes and have shown him the actual workings of my creative imaginar
don in order to emphasize the necessity of seizing upon every suggestion
made in the nine operations of the Plot Genie, Of course, We have not
developed here anything in the way of ‘a marvelous story plot. However,
it would make a very interesting romance when properly developed, and,
in fact, just as good a story as many we have read in some of our greatest
magazines.
