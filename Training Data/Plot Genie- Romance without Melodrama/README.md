# PLOT GENIE - ROMANCE WITHOUT MELODRAMA

In conjunction with Plot Robot Mechanical. We need Mechanical Robot for this and the General Formula.
* Recommended: To turn the disk once for each operation
* The 9 operations provide:
  * 1 - The Lover
  * 2 – The Beloved Locale
  * 3 – The Rival
  * 4 – The Love Obstacle
  * 5 – The Supporting Character
  * 6 – Traits of Supporting Character
  * 7 – Effort to Win
  * 8 – Threatened Defeat
  *	9 – How love is lost or won

*	The author decides between a male or female character. If the author decides to take a male character for the lover, then he should select male for rival and female for beloved.
*	For operation 5, since there are only 10 supporting characters, so when spinning Genie Robot, you take its last digit for mapping it to the list.
*	For operation 6, there are six lists and to choose which list we follow the following rule:
  *	Number ends with 1 then list 1
  *	Number ends with 2 then list 2
  *	Number ends with 3 then list 3
  *	Number ends with 4 then list 1
  *	… Number ends with 10 the list 1
  *	Page no 39-49 contains the examples of plot which can be used for testing data.
  *	There is a list of 232 suggested backgrounds, where to use that?


# Structuring of Data
Data can be structured in the same possible three approaches mentioned in “Index – README.md” file.
Problems facing:
*	Unique key can’t identify
*	Every list has to be mapped with their respective books.
