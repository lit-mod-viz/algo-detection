Introduction

The Plot Genie, m “Plot Robot” as it has been publicized internationally
by newspapers and magazines, is the: result of sixteen years of effort to perfect
a formula, and a means of its application which wculd enable student Writers
to inject plots into their stories. It has come from a process of evolution and
is not an ovcr—night creation devised as something to sell.

Some time: later when a form a satisfactory series of conclusions, I
published the hook, ”Ten Million Photoplay Plotsf’ This Was about 1918
and was my ﬁrst step in the direction of the Plot Genie.

In 1921 my back, “The Art of Dramatic; Plot Building," was published.
Credit must be given here to Will C. W'ood (now Banking Commissioner
for the State of California, Who was; at that time State Superintendent of
Schools) for an innovation Which the latter book contained. After reviewing
the book “Ten Million Photoplay, Plots." Mr. Wood called my attention to
the fact that in order to successfully teach, one should follow the established
rule of pedagogy. Which is to provide deﬁnite assignments or tasks for the
student, or examples for him to work out, This feature, which was introduced
at his suggestion, made the book a very popular one with student writers.
