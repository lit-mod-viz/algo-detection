NINETEENTH SITUATTON ’71

ment. It would seem, indeed, that drama, for Hugo,
consists in this: the causing, directly or indirectly, of
the death of a loved one; and, in the work wherein he
has accumulated the greatest number of theatrical
effects—-in “Lucréce Borgia"—we see the same situa-
tion returning no less'than ﬁve times. Near the ﬁrst
part of Act I, Gennaro permits his unrecognized
mother to be insulted; in the second part, he himself in-
sults her, not knowing her for his mother; in Act II she
demands, and is granted, the death of her unrecognized
son, then ﬁnds she has no recourse but to kill him her-
self, then is again insulted by him; ﬁnally, in Act III,
she poisons him, and, still unknown, is insulted,
threatened and slain by him.

Be it noted that Shakespealje has not in a single in-
stance employed this Nineteenth Situation, an alto-
gether accidental one, having no bearing upon his
powerful studies of the will.
