NINTH SITUATION 41

the “Rhesus” attributed to Euripides. Examples from
romance: the usual exploits of the heroes of fairy tales;
the Labors of Hercules; the majority of J ules Verne’s
stories.

(2)—Adventure Undertaken for the Purpose of
Obtaining a Beloved Woman :—Sophoc1es’ and Euri-
pides’ “(Enomaiis." From ﬁction: “Toilets of the Sea."
For the purpose of saving the honor of a lover: “La
Petite Caporale” (Darlay and de Gorsse, 1909). ‘

The Ninth Situation thus summarizes the poetry of
war, of robbery, of surprise, of desperate chance,—the
poetry of the clear-eyed adventurer, of man beyond the
restraints of artiﬁcial civilizations, of Man in the
original acceptation of the term. We ﬁnd, neverthe-
less, hardly a single French work in this class!

Lest the reader be wearied, I refrain from enumerat-
ing, under these classes so lightly touched upon, many
of the plots and complications which might be evolved
from them. Methods of tracking the human game—
bandit or hero,—-the forces conspiring for his disaster,
the conditions which make him the victim of his
masters, the ways in which revolt may arise, the al-
ternatives of the struggle in a “daring enterprise."
certainly would appear to be more complex today than
in earlier ages; moreover, upon these themes parts
borrowed from other situations may be engrafted with
remarkable ease. Even if we desire to preserve to the
said themes their archaic severity, how much may yet
be drawn from them! In how many ways, to cite but
one example, might an Adventurous Expedition be
changed by varying the motives or the object of the
enterprise, the nature of the obstacles, the qualities
of the hero, and the previous bearings of the three
indispensable elements of the drama! “Adventurous
Travels” have hardly been touched upon. And how
many other classes are there which have not been!
