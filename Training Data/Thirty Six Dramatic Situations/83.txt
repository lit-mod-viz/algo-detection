’18 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATION S

C (l)—Destruction of Honor, Fortune and Life,
by Erotic Vice:—“Germinie Lacerteux" by de Gon-
court; “Rolande” (Gramont, 1888) ; “Maman Colibri"
(Bataillq, 1904). From ﬁction: “La. Cousine Bette”;
“Le‘Capitaine Burle."

(2)-—The Same Elfect Produced by .Any Other Vice:
—”Trente Ans ou la Vie d’un J oueur"; “L’Assommoir.”
From ﬁction “L’Opium” by Bonnetain; “Lelie” by
Willy. In real life: our race-courses, our wine-shops,
our cafes, our clubs, etc. In comedy: “Un Ange"
(Capus, 1909)

Few situations, obviously, have received better and
more constant treatment during our own century—to
whose vices the Twenty-Second offers, in truth, a most
appropriate mirror, in its amalgam of gloom and erotic-
ism, at the same time presenting the most interesting
studies of nervous pathology.
