white-robed sacriﬁcers, martyrs with shining aureoles,
too-crafty Ulysses, [ﬁghtful Rakchasas, messengers

These thirty-six facets, which I have undertaken to
recover, should obviously be simple and clear, and of
no far-fwetc’hgi character; of this we shall be convinced
after seeing them repeated, with unfailing d1st1nctness,
