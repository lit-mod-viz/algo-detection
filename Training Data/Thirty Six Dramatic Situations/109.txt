I 104 THIRTYSIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS V

Poor Young Men, Dames Blanchw, etc., which-make
our ezirs ring with confusing additions and subtrac-
tions, until the unexpected ﬁnal multiplication-—“deus
ex machina”—which suddenly equalizers the two terms
of the problem, the two fortunes- of the lovers, with
the most admirably symmetrical alignment of parallel
zeros—preceded, oh joy! oh bliss! on one side as on the
other, by two identical ﬁgures!

It must of course be recognized that these social
and conventional inequalities are mere puerile details,
and that the lovers, if they have but a little courage
and sincerity, will overcome them without difﬁculty;
they can do so by simply leaving behind them titles and
money, and in a new country, under other names,
bravely beginning life again together. If, instead of
such bagatelles, we might only be sometimes shown
the more serious obstacles of inequality of ages, of
characters, of tastes—which are at the same time so
much more common! '

They are, indeed, so frequent that a general theory
might be established with regard to them. The ﬁrst
love (twenty yeam) seeks in its object equality of
rank and superiority of age (this is a fact well known
to those who have studied the cases of girl-mothers);
the second love, and in general the second period of
emotional life (thirty years), addresses itself, audacity
having been acquired, to superiors in tank but equals
in age; ﬁnally, the third love, or in a more general way
the third epoch of sentimental life, inclinm by prefer- '
ence to those who are younger and socially inferior.
Naturally, subdivision is here possible.

tingent Obstacles:—“Sieba” (Manzotti, 1883); “Et
Ma-Soeur?” (Rabier, 1911); ”Le Péché de Marthe”
