EIGHTEENTH SITUATION 67

(3) —Being Upon the Point of Taking a Sister, Un-
knowingly, as Mistress:———Ibsen’s “Ghosts." The
mother, a knowing witness, hesitates to reveal the
danger, for fear of subjecting the son to a fatal shock.

C—Being Upon the Point of Violating, Unknowingly,
a Daughterz—Partial example: “La Dame aux Domino
Rose” (Bouvier, 1882).

D (1)——Being Upon the Point of Committing an
Adultery Unknowingly (the only cases I have found in
all drama) :——“Le Roi Cerf” and “L’Amour des Trois
Oranges," both by Gozzi.

(2) —Adultery Committed Unknowingly:—probably
the “Alcmene” of Aeschylus; “Le Bon Roi Dagobert”
(Rivoire, 1908). From ﬁction: the end of “The Titan,”
by J ean-Paul RiEhter.

The various modiﬁcations of incest and other for—
bidden loves, which will be found in Situation XXVI,
may be adapted in the same manner as those here
classiﬁed. V

We have seen above instances of adultery committed
through a mistake on the part of the wife; it might also
be through a mistake by the husband. This error is
especially likely to be made by that one of the two
adulterers who is unmarried; what is more common,
for example, in the life of “pleasure," than to discover
—a little tardily—that ones mistress is a married
woman? ‘

Ignorance of the sex of the beloved is the point upon
which “Mademoiselle de Maupin” turns ; there is in the
ﬁrst place a mistake (comedy), upon which are built
the obsidional struggles of a soul (ttagi-comedy), from
which there ﬁnally results, when the truth is disclosed
a brief tragic dénouement.
