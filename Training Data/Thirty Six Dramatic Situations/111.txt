106 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

straighten yourself in your chair and crane your neck
in excitement over the gesticulations of the “jeune pre-
mier?” But his sweetheart there beside him—have you
forgotten that it is she whom he desires, or are the two
of them playing so badly, is their dialogue so little natural
that you forget the story enacted and fondly imagine
youmelf listening to a monologue, a declaration addressed
to you alone? And Monsieur there, with mouth open,
eyes starting from his head, following with avidity every
movement of the actress’s lithe ﬁgure! Quick, my
good man, another will be before you!- Be consistent,
at least! Spring upon the stage, break the insipid
dandy’s bones, and take his place!

Sorry return to promiscuity, in our overheated halls
like lupanars, which the clergy is not altogether un-
reasonable in condemning! Do people gather here
simply to study amatory manifestations? In that case,
why not freely open training schools for courtesans? Is
it for the beneﬁt of the sidewalk trafﬁc, later in the
evening, that the public is here being prepared?

0 fresh and stormy winds of Dionysian drama!
Aeschylus, where art thou who wouldst have blushed
to represent aught of amorous passion but its crimes
and infamies? Do we not, even yet, perceive the
heights to which rise those chaste pinnacles of modern
art, “Macbeth” and “Athalie?”

But why disturb ourselves? Turning our eyes from
these summits to the scene before us, we do not feel
depression; indeed, we indulge in a hearty laugh. These
characters here before us? Why, they are but puppets
of comedy, nothmg more. And the effort of their mis-
guided authors to make them serious and tragic despite
their nature has resulted in mere caricature. In more
intelligent hands, have not the best of our dramas
