CONCLUSION- 139

age in which a Saint Louis presided over the multiple
communal life, an age whose only equal in the world’s
history is that in which Pericles directed, from the
Athenian metropolis, an identical movement,—that
this understanding, which would be so useful to us,
should have been horribly compromised in the R0—
mantic carnival. Hugo’s “Notre-Dame de Paris,”
wherein the public believed it beheld a portrait of our
"moyen-age” (a most absurd appellation, by the way),
represents it, by a singular choice, as already long
dead,—after the Hundred Years’ War which bled us to
the point where we fell, passive and defenseless, under
the domination of the Florentine national art called
“renaissant,” and then of various other inﬂuences, an-
cient and foreign, during four centuries. And, down
to the very moment at which I write, the literary pro-
ductions upon the subject of this most incomparable
period of our past have been but pitiable affairs. But
yesterday, a Renan was writing of ogival art as an
effort which had been impotent (“Souvenirs d’Enfance
et de Jeunesse”) or which at most had fathered works
of no enduring character (“Priére sur l’Acrople”) ; the
very Catholic Huysmans, in his “En Route,” was
making the most astounding salad of Roman vaulting,
Primitive painting, Gregorian plain—chant,—a salad
whose recipe is “the Faith” and which is called, natur-

centuries of humanity, plus onethird of humanity’s
authentic history, three epochs strongly antagonistic
to each other, peoples widely diverse and opposed; a
something equivalent to a marriage between Alcibiades
and Saint Genevieve.

The “Moyen-ﬁge," or, to speak more accurately, the
X11, XIII, and XIV Centuries, were not in the least
fantastic and freakish; this is the character merely of
an occasional generation, such as that of Louis-
Philippe. Neither were they mystic, in the present
