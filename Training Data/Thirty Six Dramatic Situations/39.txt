34 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS‘

C (1)—Ingratitude Suffered (of all the blows of
misfortune, this is perhaps the most poignant):—
Euripides’ “Archelaus” (excepting the dénouement, in
which the action is reversed) ; Shakespeare’s “Timon
of Athens" and “King Lear,” and the beginning of his
“Coriolanus”; Byron’s “Marina Faliero”; a part of
“The Count of Carmagnola,” by Manzoni. Bismarck’s
dismissal by the young Emperor William. The

- martyrs, the many instances of devotion and sacriﬁce
nnappreciated by those who have beneﬁted by it, the
most glorious of deaths shine against this dark back-
ground; Socrates and the Passion are but the most
celebrated examples. “Le Reformateur” (Rod, 1906).

(2)—The Sutfering of 'Unjust Punishment or
Enmity (this corresponds in some degree to the
“Judicial Errors") :——Sophoc1es’ “Teucer”; Aeschylus’
“Salaminiae.”

(3)—An Outrage Suffered:—-the ﬁrst act of “The
Cid”; the ﬁrst act of “Lucrece Borgia.” The “point of .
honor" offers better material than these simple
episodes. We may imagine some more sensitive
Voltaire, reduced by his persecutions to helplessness
and to the point of dying in despair.

D (1)-—Abandopment by a Lover or a Husband:—
“Faust”; Corneille’s “Ariana"; the beginning of the
“Medeas”; “Maternite” (Brieux, 1903).

(2)—Children Lost by Their Parents:—”Le Petit
Poucet.” ,

If classes B, C and D, which are concerned with the
fate of individuals, have been so much less developed
than they might easily have been, what shall be said
of the case of social disasters, such as Class A?
Shakespeare did not tread far enough upon that
majestic way. Only-among the Greeks has a work of
this kind presented at one stroke that conception of
human events, sublime, fatalistic and poetic, of which
Herodotus was one day to create history.
