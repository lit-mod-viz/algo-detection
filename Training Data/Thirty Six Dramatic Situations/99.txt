TWENTY-SIXTH SITUATION
CRIMES OF LOVE .
(The Lover; the Beloved)

This is the only tragic situation of all those built
upon Love, that subject being one essentially belonging

First: Onanism, that “solitary vice” which does not
lead to actlon, can furnish only melancholy silhouettes
such as the legend of N arcissus and “Charlot s’amuse.”
or certain grotesqueries of Aristophanes, unless it be
made the basis for a study of the weakening and col-
lapse of the Will, in which case it might be grouped
with drunkenness, gambling, etc., in Situation XXII.

Second: Violation, like murder, is but an act,
generally a brief one and not a situation; at most it
approaches “Abduction.” Even the consequences to
the perpetrator, like those of the

Third: Prostitution and its succeedant gallantry and
