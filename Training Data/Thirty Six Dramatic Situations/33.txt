28 THXRTY-SXX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

ing to the living; an imprudent promise; a profession-
al duty (as when the avenger is a magistrate, etc.);
the necessity of saving other relatives or a beloved one
(thus did Talien avenge the Dantonists) or even fellow-
citizens; ignorance of the kinship which exists between
Avenger and Criminal. There yet remains that case
in which the Avenger strikes without having recog-
nized the Criminal (in a dark room, I suppose); the
case in which the act of intended vengeance is but the
result of an error, the supposedlyguilty kinsman being
found innocent, and his pseudo—executioner discovering
that he has but made 70f himself a detestable criminal.

A (1)-—A Father’s Death Avenged Upon a Mother:
—“The Choephores" of Aeschylus; the “E1ectras” of
Sophocles, Euripides, Attilius, Q. Cicero, Pradon, Longe-
pierre, Crébillon, Rochefort, Chéniergand of Guillard’s
opera; the “Orestes” of Voltaire and of Alﬁeri;
Sophocles’ “Epigones;” the “Eriphyles” of Sophocles
and of Voltaire; and lastly “Hamlet," in which we recog~
nize so clearly the method by which the poet rejuven-
ates his subjects,—by an almost antithetic change of
characters and of milieu.

(2)—A Mother Avenged Upon a Fatherz—“Zoe
Chien—Chien" (Matthey, 1881) in which the parricide
is counter-balanced by an incestuous passion, and is
committed by the daughter, not by the son.

B—A Brother’s Death Avenged Upon a Son (but
without premeditation, this accordingly falling almost
mto the situétion “Imprudence") :—Aeschylus’ “Ata-
lanta.” and Sophocles’ “Meleager.”

C—A Father’s Death Avenged Upon a Husband:—
“Rosmunde” (Rucellai).

D-——A Husband’s Death Avenged Upon a Father:—
“Orbecche” by Giraldi.

Thus, of twenty-two works, eighteen are in the same
class, seventeen in the same sub—class, thirteen upon
the same subject;—four clasées and one suchlass
