CONCLUSION 137

restricted to a small number of legends ((Edipus,
Agamemnon, Phaedra, etc.,), which each poet had in
his turn to treat, thus being unable to escape compari-
son, step by step, with each of his predecessors, so that
even the least critical of spectators could see What
part his personality and taste had in the new work.
The worst which may be said of this tradition is that
it rendered originality more difﬁcult. By a study of
the Thirty-Six Situations and their results, the same
advantage may be obtained Without its accompanying
inconvenience. Thencefotth Proportion alone will
assume signiﬁcance.

“good taste” and by “imagination,” will bring about the
recognition of that quality more or less forgotten in
modern art,-——“beauty." By this I mean, not the skil-
