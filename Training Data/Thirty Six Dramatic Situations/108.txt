TWENTY-EIGHTH SITUATION
OBSTACLES TO LOVE
(Two Lovers; an Obstacle)

A (l)-—Marriage Prevented by Inequality of
Rank:—“Nitétis" and “The Chinese Hero" by Metas-
tasio: “Le Prince Soleil" (Vasseur, 1889); second act
of “La Vie Publique" (Fabre, 1901); “Ramuntcho”
(Pierre Loti, 1908);_“L’Emigré” (Bourget, 1908). This
is the sentimental—philosophical Situation of a great
number of eighteenth century works (“Nanine,” etc.),
in which :1 lord invariably falls in love with a peasant
girl. In George Sand, on the contrary, it is always a
lady who is in love with a man of inferior tank; a sort
of literature which at least has inspired many gallant
adventures of our own time. The addition of one more
little obstacle—the marriage bond—fumishes the pre-
text for the real intrigue of “Ruy Blas.”

(2)—Inequality of Fortune an Impediment to
Marriage:—“Myrtille” and in part “Friend Fritz” by
Erckmann—Chatrian; “L'Abbe Constantin" by Halevy;
“Ia Petite Amie” (Brieux, 1902); “La Plus Faible”
(Prevost, 1904); “La Veuve Joyeuse” (Meilhac, Léon
and Stein, 1909); “Le Danseur Inconnu" (Bernani, 1909) ;
“La Petite Chocolatiére”_ (Gavault, 1909); “Primetose”;
“Le Réve” (from Zola’s story by Bruneau); in ﬁction;
“Le Bonheur des Dames”—to mention only the more
estimable works, leaving aside the endless number of
trivial plays imitative of Scribe, and the Romances of
