70 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

vellian Advice: (see XVII) :—Sophocles’ “Pelias” and
Euripides’ “Peliades”; Voltaire’s “Mahomet” (in which .
the hero is also upon the point of marrying his sister
unknowingly). The Simple Slaying of a Father Un-
recognized2—Legendary example: Laius. From ro-
mance: “The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitaller."
The Same Case Reduced From Murder to Simple Insult:
——“Le Pain d’Autrui” (after Turgenieff, by Ephraim
and Schutz, 1890). Being Upon the Point of Slaying
a Father Unknowinglyz—“Israel” (Bernstein, 1908).

F‘ (1)—A Grandfather Slain Unknowingly, in
Vengeance .and Through Instigationz—“Les Bur-
graves” (Hugo).

(2)—Slajn Involuntarilyz—Aeschylus’ “Polydectes.”

(3)—A Father-In-Law Killed Involuntarily:—-
Sophocles’ “Amphitryon.”

G (l)—Involuntary Killing of a Loved Woman:—
Sophocles’ “Procris.” Epic example: Tancred and
Clorinda, in “Jerusalem Delivered.” Legendary ex-
ample (with change of the sex of the person loved):
Hyacinthus.

(2)—Being Upon the Point of Killing a Lover Un-
recognized:—“The Blue Monster” by Gozzi.

(3)—Fa.ilure to Rescue an Unrecognized Son:—
“Saint Alexis" (a XIV Century Miracle of Notre-
Dame) ; “La Voix du Sang" (Rachilde).

Remarkable is the liking of Hugo (and consequently
of his imitators) for this somewhat rare situation. .
Each of the ten dramas of the old Romanticist contains
it; in two of them, “Hemanif’ and “Torquemada,” it is.
in a manner accessory to the Seventeenth (Imprud-
ence), fatal to the hero also; in four (“Marion Del~
orme," “Angelo,” “La Esmeralda," “Ruy Bias”) this
case of involuntary injury to a loved one supplies all the
action and furnishes the best episodes; in four others
("Le Roi s’amuse,” “Marie Tudor,” “Lucréce Borgia"
“Les Burgraves") it serves furthermore as dénom}
