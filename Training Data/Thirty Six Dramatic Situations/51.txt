TWELFTH SITUATION
OBTAINING

(A Solicitor and an Adversary Who Is Refusing, or
an Arbitrator and Opposing Parties.)

Diplomacy and eloquence here come into play. An
end is to be attained, an object to be gained. What
interests may not be put at stake, what weighty
arguments or inﬂuences removed, what intermediaries
or disguises may be used to transform anger into
benevolence, tancor into renouncement; to put the
Despoiler in the place of the Despoiled? What mines
may be sprung, what counter-mines discovered !—what
unexpected revolts of submissive instruments! This
dialectic contest which arises between reason and
passion, sometimes subtile and persuasive, sometimes
forceful and violent, provides a ﬁne situation, as natural
as it is original.

A—Eﬁ‘orts to Obtain an Object by Ruse or Force:—
the “Philoctetes” of Aeschylus, of Sophocles and of
Euripides; the reclamation of the Thebans in “(Edipus
at Colonus"; “The Minister’s Ring," by Vishakadatta.

B—Endeavof by Means of Persuasive Eloquence
Alone:—“The Desert Isle,” by Metastasio; the father's
attitude in “Le Fils Naturel” (Dumas), to which Ruse
is soon afterward added; Scene 2 of Act V of Shake-
speare’s “Coriolanus.”

C—Eloquence With an Arbitrator:—“The Judgment
of Arms,” by Aeschylus; “Helen Reclaimed,” by
Sophocles.
