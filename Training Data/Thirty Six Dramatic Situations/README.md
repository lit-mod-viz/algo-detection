# Dataset structure for Thirty Six Dramatic Situations

In this file we describe how we structure the data available in the book and create a dataset.

## Structure of the book:
- Introduction: Irrelevant to our current needs
- Each chapter henceforth defines and gives examples of each of the thirty six dramatic situations. An example of a chapter
 stucture is illustrated below:
### Sample chapter structure
- Name of the situation
- Dynamic elements involved in the situation
- Situation is divided into groups (generally of two or three)
- Each group is further divided into different scenarios possible in that situation: **this is the data that will be useful us**
- Each scenario has examples given from existing dramatic texts: *this does not help us because the examples are taken from popular
texts, so they may not be similar enough to any text in our testing corpus.*
- Conclusions about the situation
