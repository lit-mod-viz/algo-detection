TENTH SITUATION
ABDUCTION

(The Abductor; the Abducted; the Guardian)

01', the Great Bourgeois Romance! Was it not thus
that Moliére used to put an end to his comedies, when
he judged that the moment had arrived for sending
his audience home satisﬁed? Sometimes he substi-
tuted a treasure-box for a girl, as in “Tartuffe,” or
arranged an exchange of the one for the other, as in
“L'Avare.” ’

We ﬁnd in ABDUCTION one of the situations bear-
ing upon Rivalry, and in which Jealousy appears,
although not painted with so superb a coloring as in the
Twenty-fourth.

In two of the following classes (B and C)‘ we may
remark the intrusion of the situations “Adultery” and
“Recovery of a Lost Loved One.” The same usage is
quite possible in almost all the other situations. I
would point out to those who may be interested in a
more detailed analysis, that love is not necessarily the
motive of Abduction (in Class D will be found friend-
ship, faith, etc.) nor the reason of the obstacles raised
by the guardian.

A—Abduction of an Unwilling Woman:—Aeschy1us’
and Sophocles’ “Orithyies”; Aeschylus’ “Europa” and
“The Carians.” “With Fire and Sword" (after Sien-
kiewicz, 1904). Comedy: “Le Jeu de Robin et de
