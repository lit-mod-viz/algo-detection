Two approaches to structure the data:
1. Different columns for 9 elements, listing all the 180 data rows in each.
    Advantages:
    1. More Readable
    2. More Accessible
2. Four columns: one for numbering, one for category representing 9 elements, one text column with its 180 elements, third for data type - word or sentence
    Advantages:
    1. Concise form of data
    2. Easier to combine with other books' data
    3. Rows makes more sense
3. Keys for 9 elements and through that key we can map a table for that column contaning the 180 elements
    Advantages:
    1. Better structuring of data
