Hill referred to his eardboard spinner wheel as; a “Plat Robot.”
An aspiring author was instructed to turn the device a certain
number of times, to seleet a randem number (usually between 1
to 180). Plot Genie users; then eonssulted the lists to arrive at all
the elements Hill believed necesssary for a fully realized plot.

Bold Venture Press will have additional materials on its website
for Plot Genie enthusiasts. A downloadable “Plot Robot." which
can be assembled by eager authors, will be available. We are
examining the possibility of offering professionally manufactured
“Plot Robot” wheels for authors who prefer a more polished
touch.

Several “Random Number Generators” are online These
websites make an excellent subsstitute for the Plot Robot“
