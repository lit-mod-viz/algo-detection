At a cost less than spark plugs and in only 30 min- 
utes’ time, you can place OVRHAUL in your cylinders 
and start reaping the benefits of this amazing invention. 
Ko special tools needed — no car tie-up — no danger of 
mining your motor by grinding the cylinder walls. 

"Some users report even greater savings, however let us 
send you Impartial Certified Laboratory tests which 
prove conclusively what Ovrhaul is doing.

Salesmen and Distributors are 
sashing in Big with Ovrhaul. It is 
so revolutionary — so positive in its 
action — so new and different and 
saves the motorist so much money— 
that representatives say OVR- 
HAUL is the quickest seller and 
biggest profit-maker they have had 
in years. Not a gasoline dope, nor 
gadget. Does not contain graphite 
or harmful abrasives. 18 million 
car owners need Ovrhaul. If you 
want in on this, send the coupon 
opposite or a penny post card and 



Amaiisig new mineral plating saves 
yp to 50% on oli% .. increases gas 
mileage up to 45%% . . adds new 
pepp speed and ciuiet ... ail at a frac- 
tion of new ring and re- 
bore cost. Coupon below 
brings you sample free! 

A miner’s chance discovery plus scientific re- 
search are responsible for Ovrhaul — “The modem 
way to recondition your motor.” The action of this 
amazing mineral (motor heat expands it up to 30 
times) is astonishing. This patented mineral plating 
process threatens to revolutionize the cost of motor 
upkeep. Already nearly a quarter of a million car own- 
ers are using Ovrhaul ia place of new ring and rebore 
jobs.

Since motor cars were first invented — OIL WASTE, LOW 
GAS MILEAGE, LOW COMPRESSION, LOST POWER 
and NOISY MOTORS, caused by worn rings and cylinders, 
have brought great expense to car owners. Before Ovrhaul, 
it was necessary to put in new rizigs and rebore the cylinders, 
costing up to $150.00. Now — a single application of Ovrhaul 
quickly checks oil waste— increases gas mileage and compres- 
sion and adds new 
power, pep, speed and 
quiet, all at a fraction 
of the cost of new 
rings and leboring.

V/hy Trained Accountants Command 



I 

G. 



-and how ambitious men are qualifying 
by the LaSalle Problem Method 



High Salaries 



I ET this straight. 

By “accountancy” vve do not mean “bookkeep- 
ing.” For accountancy begins where bookkeeping 
leaves oiT. 

The skilled accountant takes the figures handed 
him by the bookkeeper, and analyzes and interprets 
them. 

He knows how much the costs in the various 
departments should amount to, how they may 
be lowered. 

He knows what profits should be expected from 
a given enterprise, how they may be increased. 

He knows, in a given business, what per cent of 
one’s working capital can safely be tied up in mer- 
chandise on hand, what per cent is safe and ade- 
quate for sales promotion. And these, by the way, 
are but two of scores of percentage-figures where- 
with he points the way to successful operation. 

He knows the intricacies of govern- 
ment taxation. 

He knows how to survey the trans- 
actions of a business over a given 
Mriod; how to show in cold, hard 
figures the progress it has made and 
where it is going. He knows how to 
■use these findings as a basis for con- 
structive policies. 

In short, the trained accountant is 
the controlling engineer of business — 
one man business cannot do without. 

Small wonder that he commands a 
salary two to ten times as great as 
that of the book- 
keeper. Indeed, as an 
independent operator 
(head of his own ac- 
counting firm) he may 
earn as much as the 
president of the big 
and influential bank 
in his community, or 
the operating man- 
ager of a great rail- 
road. 




Some Examples 

Small wonder that ac- 
countancy oflFers the 
trained man such fine 
opportunities — op- 
portunities well illus- 
trated by the success

LaSalle accountancy students.* For example — one 
man was a plumber, 32 years old, with only an 
eleventh grade education. Today he is auditor for 
a large bank and his income is 32S per cent larger. 

Another was a drug clerk at )?30 a week. Now 
he heads his own very successful accounting firm 
with an income many times as large. 

A woman bookkeeper — buried in details of a 
small job — is now auditor of an apartment hotel, 
and her salary mounted in proportion to her work. 

A credit manager — earning 3200 a month — 
moved up quickly to 33000, to 35000, and then to 
a highly profitable accounting business of his own 
which nets him better than 310,000 a year. 

And What It Means to You 

Why let the other fellow walk away with the 
better job, when right in your own home you can 
equip yourself for a splendid future in this profit- 
able profession? 

Are you really determined to get 
Through ahead? If so, you can start at once 
^countoncy to acquire — by the LaSalle Problem 
Method — a thorough understanding 
of Higher Accountancy, master its 
fundamental principles, become ex- 
pert in the practical application of 
those principles — this without losing 
an hour from work or a dollar of pay. 

Preliminary knowledge of book- 
keeping is unnecessary. You will be 
given whatever training, instruction 
or review on the subject of bookkeep- 
ing you may personal- 
ly need — and without 
any extra expense to 
you. 

If you are dissatis- 
fied with your present 
equipment — if you 
recognize the oppor- 
tunities that lie ahead

The Story Behind the Story 



■^OURTH-DIMENSIONAL tales, time- 
traveling stories, interplanetary yarns, 
biological fantasies, astronomical 
catastrophes — what is the why for all 
these varieties of science fiction? We read 
an interplanetary novelette, are fascinated 
by some of the stimulating ideas contained 
therein, then sit back and admire the 
writer’s ingenuity. 

That a vast percentage of the readers 
of THRILLING WONDER STORIES 
are vitally concerned regarding the origins, 
backgrounds and themes of the stories they 
read has already been demonstrated con- 
clusively by their numerous letters of ap- 
probation since the inception of this de- 
partment. 

It’s an absorbing game going behind the 
scenes, looking right over the author’s 
shoulder at the half-started page in his 
typewriter. 

But here’s a word of warning. Don’t 
anesthetize the effect of the stories by 
consulting the following letters prior to 
reading the works they tel! about. In 
several letters the authors tip their hands 
— and what is intended to be a surprise in 
the story is frankly discussed. So turn 
back here only after you’ve read the entire 
issue. 

UNIVERSAL DOOM 

J UDGMENT SUN, by EANDO BIND- 
ER, is a mighty interesting story from 
its dramatic start to the surprising climax. 
Here’s how Mr. Binder explains the gen- 
esis of his novelette: 

The idea behind JUDGMENT SUN was one 
of those that strike suddenly. I had been 
vacuously casting- about for a good plot, but 
wanted to get away from the usual themes. 
How about something really appalling in the 
way of Earthly dooms, but at the same time 
something close to the ground? It may have 
been my subconscious grilling that suddenly 
gave life to the idea of the sun falling down on 
Earth, There was a menace or a terror that 
was personal — one that each reader would feel 
menaced him. 

From there it was a natural step to split the 
story into separate episodes, to indicate how 
universal, how far reaching the doom was. It 
was a human interest theme, and as such had 
to be developed from the angle of human emo- 
tion, rather than action. The jungle scene sug- 
gested Itself immediately, for what can shake 
a man’s guilt out of his secret soul quicker 
than the knowledge of doom — and judgment? 
And so with the other scenes. Each was the 
choice out of dozens or hundreds of similar 
episodes that might he occurring anywhere on 
Earth during those tumultuous hours. 

The science of the story is frankly subordi- 
nate to the human interest. It called for no 
more stretch of imagination than the usual 
doom story, but had to be plausible for the sake 
of realism. For that reason the "ether-strain" 
explanation had to be complete, but sketchy in 
order to take up as little space as possible. 

1 have always been of the opinion, right or 
wrong, that science fiction needs much more 



of human interest. "With the influence that 
the late Weinbaum exercised on science-fiction, 
I am glad to note a definite trend toward the 
humanizing of its once so cold and lifeless 
characters. We need scientists that are not 
wooden puppets; villains that are humanly, yet 
viciously, motivated; heroes that go more by the 
heart than by the mind; and menaces that hit 
us between the eyes. 

1 do not mean that we should stop exploring 
the immeasurable reaches of space, or halt the 
progress of super-science, or limit the boundless 
delving of imagination, in our stories, but I do 
believe we at the other side of the editorial 
desk should not hesitate to have our characters 
act in accordance with human nature. Too 
often our hero follows a p.sychology path laid 
out by a framework of science, and fails to be 
fundamentally human. 

At any rate, the story of THE JUDGMENT 
SUN attempts to show the probable reaction of 
humanity to the panic of world’s end, as charac- 
terized by a few chosen examples of ifs collec- 
tive hordes. If it creates in the reader the 
slightest thrill of personal danger, it has hit 
its mark. Otherwise it has missed it completely 
and ingloriously. 

FUTURE V/ARFARE 

4 UTHUR L. ZAGAT’S novelette, THE 
FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE, 
is a plausible account of what might hap- 
pen in a future war between forces de- 
pending mainly on scientific weapons for 
supremacy. Here’s what Mr, Zagat has 
to say regarding the development of his 
story: 

The pattern of life does not change though 
the environment, perhaps even the form of 
Man undergoes a constant mutation. Through 
the ages the fundamentals of this thing we call 
living remain the same; loyaltv and treachery, 
selflessness and greed, patriotism and treason, 
self-seeking and self-sacrifice, friendship and 
enmity, love and hate, adventure and desuetude. 

It was the conflict and inlerplay of these that 
furnished with the warp of his tales the earliest, 
Cro-Magnon story-weaver, crouching shaggy 
and brute-faced in the communal cave and dis- 
pelling with the magic of his grunted, mono- 
syllabic speech the tribe’s shuddering dread of 
the sabre-tooth tiger whose roar beat out of 
the fearful dark against the portal boulder. 
They composed the lay of the silk-ribboned 
troubadour, strumming his lyre In the castle’s 
high-raftered hall while armored sentries paced 
the battlements. They furbish the pages of 
printed books and vibrate through the ether on 
the wings of a modern miracle. 

Tomorrow — who knows by what unthought-of 
medium they will reach the brains and hearts 
and dreams of men. But always they were, and 
are. and wiD be, unaltered. 

"Once upon a time" Attila's hordes swept 
ravening to the conquest of a -world. Once 
Alexander, and Genghi.s Khan fought for uni- 
versal empire. Once Napoleon closed a fist 
knuckled with cannon upon all Europe. Today 
— listen to the pound of the forge, the roar of 
the furnace fires, the hissing of chemists* 
acids fashioning new w-eapons tor an old at- 
tack, . . . 

And tomorrow? Tomorrow it will be the 
same as yesterday. In the near future the 
would-be conqueror may come from some race 
newly reborn to lust for dominance. In the 
dim reaches of Time to Come he may sweep 
upon Terra from some distant Planet, from

THE STORy BEHIND 
THE STORy 

(Concluded from page 10) 

*>ome Sun incredibly far across incredible Si ace. 
But come he will. . . . 

And he will be fought with courage. With 
devotion and skill and ingenuity set against 
the might he deems overwhelming, but always 
and ever with courage. 

When the fight is over, won or lost, some 
yarn-spinner who.se primal germ lies unguessed 
in your loins or mine, or that of the elevator 
boy who just closed the gate in your anteroom, 
will sing the saga of those newer heroes. 

To anticipate some narrator who lies curled 
in the womb of Things to Be, to peer a little 
behind the veil that screens That Which Is 
to Happen, I wrote FLIGHT OF THE SILVER 
EAGLE. That adventure will not occur, to be 
sure. But some other adventure w^hose human 
fundamentals will be just the same is as cer- 
tain to occur as that in this next instant I 
will complete this sentence. 



MYSTERy MAN OF SPACE 

W ANDERER OF THE VOID, by Dr. 

ARCH CARR, the cover story for 
this issue, carries a surprise ending that 
we’re certain few readers will anticipate. 
Here’s how Dr. Carr planned his inter- 
planetary short: 

I wanted to write a story about space 
piracy and a lone wolf crusader wdio, for reasons 
knowm only to himself, waged a fierce and 
single-handed warfare against these buccaneers 
of the skies. 

This crusader would be a man of mystery, 
of course; his identity unknown on any planet. 
It would be necessary, therefore, to mask him, 
for he must often come in contact with space 
patrolmen and others. 

The idea of making him a metal man gov- 
erned by an organic brain seemed good. But 
where was I to get the human intelligence 
which must inhabit this brain? Then I made 
use of an idea that I had had in mind for 
some time — that of liberating the human in- 
telligence by subjecting the body to an electri- 
cal wave whose frequency was the same as 
that of the body upon which it was directed. 

This, too, seemed good; I could take the in- 
telligence from someone who had been victim- 
ized by pirates and thus provide my crusader 
with his motive. 

The story was started and action precipitated 
by having the child become affected by a har- 
monic of the wave directed upon her father. 
And so it was in this manner that WANDERER 
OF THE VOID came to be written. 



A DYING PLANET 

N eil R. JONES* fascinating novelette 
of Earth’s last stand, and of Man’s 
first space migration, was written after 
some considerable attention had been de- 
voted to the theme by the author. Jones 
did a careful job on this, as you’ll realize 
from reading this: 

THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS explains itself. 
It is the conception of a dying world, with hu- 
manity still persisting in spite of adversity. It is 
proved that planets have age, that they be- 
come old and uninhabitable. Their best ages 
of existence fade away. H. G. Wells’ “The 
Time Machine” afforded me much food for 
thought on the subject. 

It is extremely doubtful that mankind will 
carry on for five million years, or a million more 
years for that matter. Aa a group, he is Ilka 

12 



the Jug that is carried to the well too often. 
There are too many things which may happen 
to him. Yet, there still remains a possibility 
that he may struggle onward for five million 
years. Regarding this possibility, t have pre- 
sented but one viewpoint of what might hap- 
pen, what he might be like, yet there is nothing 
too definite on which to base this assumption. 
Too many things can happen to change history, 
environment and man himself. Man’s evolution 
is guided largely by environment and his own 
initiative. 

It is scarcely to be taken for granted that 
the course of the world’s civilization shall be 
forward. There will be inevitable retrogre.ssion. 
Mankind will, to all probabilities, ri.^e and fall, 
change form and shape, revert to degenerate 
.savagery, return again to a civilized slate. 
Mankind is menaced with all forms of destruc- 
tion, including himself, for Man is often Man’s 
worst enemy. I have drawn a very conserva- 
tive conception of the change w'rought in Man 
after five million years, for it is to Vie expected 
that he may assume an even more radical ap- 
pearance than that suggested in the tale. 

Man long ago lost his tail and most of the 
hair which entirely covered his body. Hi.s 
appendix, too, is due to become pas.se. In time, 
with the help of science, he may come to .sub- 
sist entirely upon radiated energy: this, after 
having supplemented his digestive diet with 
more and more of the radiated energy until 
finally the digestive organs have become ex- 
tinct. When Earth grow.s old. Man, if he be 
sufficiently intelligent, must find a new world 
peculiarly adapted to him. It is most likely 
that during the rise and fall of humanity 
throughout the ages, space flying will be re- 
discovered and lost many times. There may 
even be visitors from beyond our own Solar 
S3’’stem. 

Man’s occasional retrogressions to savagery 
and animalism will probably be swifter than his 
forward returns, evolution following the line of 
least resistance. That he will become the food- 
less and .sleepless creature depicted in my story 
is but one of myriad possibilities, for many 
things can happen to him in so long a time. 
No one can with any certainty anticipate the 
far-flung destiny of Man: in the light of reason- 
able consideration, they may only conjecture. 



ATOMIC ADVENTURE 

R ay CUMMINGS will always be fa- 
mous for his stories of atomic explor- 
ation, Here’s how the author of ELIXIR 
OF DOOM first conceived this theme: 

Once I was a very earnest young bu^nessman. 
I took a subway ride. I sat idly staring at the 
advertisements over the seats across from me. 
My attention focussed on an ad of the Quaker 
Oats Company. It showed the portly figure of 
a Quaker gentleman in a three-cornered hat. 
He held in his hand a box of oats, on which was 
a picture of the same gentleman holding a 
.similar package. And on that package I could 
distinguish a still smaller’ Quaker still holding 
another tiny package. 

I stared spellbound. I began to wonder if, by 
going closer to the ad, I would see a fourth 
smaller Quaker? And a fifth? If I had a micro- 
scope — and the printing were mathematically 
perfect — how many could I see? 

An infinite numberl Quaker Oats, down Into 
the infinity of smallness! 

I went home, seized pencil and paper. Thus 
my first atomic story, “The Girl in the Golden 
Atom,” was born. And it has served as in- 
spiration for all my other science fiction. 

But I was blissfully ignorant. In writing my 
first story, I violated every rule of plot con- 
struction and handling. For in.stance, I called 
my hero the Very Young Man. When the story 
was in proof, an irritated proofreader phoned 
me, asking for a name for the damned hero. I 
tol(? him that I didn’t know, except that he was 
the Very Young Man, and would he please leave 
me alone, because I didn't want to be bothered.

The JUDGMENT 



A Complete Novelette 
of 

Doomsday Panic 

By 

EANDO BINDER 

Author oi “S. O. S. in Space." "The Hot. 
mone Menace,’’ etc, 

CHAPTER I 
World’s End 

HE earth was falling into the 
sun! 

There was no doubt about 
it. It was to be seen with one’s own 
eyes! In the Western Hemisphere, 
the people on the Atlantic coast saw 
a swollen sun arise from the sea. 
Blood-red and distorted by uneven 
refraction, it reared above the hori- 
zon like a giant eye of doom. 

It seemed, to fishermen staring awe- 
struck over the waters, that this in- 
credible sun that was four times larg- 
er than usual, hung for a moment as 
though too heavy to rise. Or as 
though it were gathering strength for 
a titanic effort to pursue its ageless 
course despite increased mass. 

There it hung for an instant. Then, 
like a cosmic, bloated leech, swelled 
by some nameless feast of celestial 
vampirism, it shoved its ponderous, 
unbelievable bulk above sea level. 
Blood-hued, puffed like a strained 
balloon, insanely overgrown like a 
malignant toadstool, this monster sun 
loomed into the sky, defiling its pure, 
dainty blue. 

The fishermen had seen many and 




In the back of his mind each 



many a sun swollen by refraction dur- 
ing the dawn, but never had they seen 
such a huge orb spew from the eastern 
waves. And when the passage of an 
hour failed to reduce this awful phe-

person knew that the world was coming to an end 



nomenon, and made it certain that it 
was to remain, the fishermen franti- 
cally hoisted sail. Their only thought 
was to flee from this ominous thing. 

Faces white beneath the salt-spray 



tan, they turned away and refused to 
look again at the hideous, enlarged 
globe of fire. 

The leviathan sun flamed its way 
up into the heavens. It seemed to

THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



fuse the sky together, so that it ran 
molten in streaks of ultramarine and 
glowing yellow. Beneath it, the ocean 
seemed to lose its deep blue-green 
and become crystal clear because of 
the piercing flood of rays from above. 

Then this stupendous sun, as 
though Phaeton-driven, lifted itself 
ponderously, for all the people of that 
part of the world to see, and a rising 
volume of fearful, gasping cries 
seemed to swell upward from millions 
of throats. The sun! The sun was 
twice as wide as it should be! Its 
face was four times larger than nor- 
mal! What in the name of all the 
gods was happening? 

The answer came to all, to some in- 
sidiously, to others hammeringly, to 
yet others explosively — the sun is 
falling down on Earth! Or to the 
more scientific-minded who were cor- 
rect in little details — Earth is falling 
into the sun! 

Einstein might have thought for an 
instant — if any man could be so de- 
tached in nature — ah! a chance to 
demonstrate the basic principle of 
relativity at one stroke to all the 
world. For, whichever way you put 
it, sun onto Earth, or Earth into sun, 
the end result was the same ! 

Great catastrophes and holocausts 
of the past paled into utter insignifi- 
cance beside this one. The great Chi- 
cago fire, the four-year carnage of the 
World War, even the legendary sink- 
ing of Atlantis — what were they com- 
pared to this world doom? Stagger- 
ing millions had been wiped out by 
the Black Plague of medieval times, 
perhaps one-third of the existing 
population, but here all — all must die ! 
There would be no younger genera- 
tion to clean up and begin anew'. 

This was that inconceivable thing — 
death for all. The human mind, no 
more than it can think upon its own 
personal death without an alarming 
unrest, could not really grasp the 
thought of universal doom without 
going blank. Minds that did fully 
absorb the horrific thought, those 
minds went mad. But in the majority 
of people, a temporary barrier of de- 
lusionary amnesia kept them from 
realizing what it meant when their 



cracked lips spoke out the doom. One 
can imagine people walking around 
like shell-shock victims, muttering; 

“Everyone is going to die — every- 
one on Earth!” and then grinning 
foolishly at the absurdity. 

Yet in the back of his mind each 
person knew, knew in such a horribly 
positive way, that all were going to 
die, the whole world at once and as 
one. It ran like a moan through the 
seared atmosphere — “Everyone is go- 
ing to die !” 

Everyone is going to die! 
Everyone — is — going — to — die! 
EVERYONE! 

A t Williams Bay, Wisconsin, a 
group of scientists, both profes- 
sional and academic, got together at 
eight o’clock in the morning of that 
day of doom. Some had driven up 
from Chicago, others had come by 
train and bus, one had even flown up 
there to Yerkes Observatory, instinc- 
tively seeking out astronomical au- 
thority. The answer must be here. 

Yet for all their hopes, these men 
could not fail to notice that the air 
was tropically warm and the humidity 
almost insufferable. Even if Earth did 
stop its mad plunge sunward, the in- 
creased temperature would drive civ- 
ilization toward the poles. 

At last a murmur rose from the 
troubled crowd gathered at the town’s 
small central park. A huge car rolled 
up and several figures stepped out al- 
most before it had come to a stop. A 
group of four made its way to the 
rostrum where on summer evenings 
the municipal band gave its concerts. 

The crowd quieted down as white- 
haired, portly Professor Hargreave, 
second official of the Yerkes Observa- 
tory, nervously wiped his sweated 
face and confronted them. 

“Gentlemen, I — this is an honor — ’’ 
Ridiculous words, yet the crowd 
did not laugh or smile politely to it- 
self. Momus himself, god of laughter 
and merriment, would have been pow- 
erless to wring a single chuckle from 
this grim, dazed crowd. Professor 
Hargreave drew a long breath and 
continued : 

“Well, you all want to know what 



THE JUDGMENT SUN 



17 



the official report on this — this phe- 
nomenon is.” A murmur o£ anxious 
assent came from the audience. 
“Well, it seems — that is — dammit all, 
gentlemen, we have no report! And 
I don’t know what you got me down 
here for in the first place. Did you 
expect that if we said the earth was 
not falling into the sun, that the thing 
would promptly change back to nor- 
mal? What do your own eyes tell 
you?” 

The crowd gasped and seemed to 
huddle together. 

“About the only report I could give 
you is something you all know any- 
way. That the sun’s apparent diame- 
ter is almost twice normal, which 
means that it has approached within 
fifty million miles. It is too early yet 
to figure the rate at which Earth is 
moving — he drev/ out the next word 
with an effort — “sunward, but it must 
be at least at a speed of one thousand 
miles per second. 

“Unbelievable as it seems, our 
planet is already as close to the sun 
as Mercury at its furthest aphelion! 
The lag in rising temperature, which 
should result, can be explained by 
our dense atmosphere, which is acting 
as a protective blanket. But when 
the atmosphere becomes saturated 
with heat — ” 

He broke off, as though the rest 
were too horrible, and finished lame- 
ly, “V/ell, that’s all I can say — ” 

He turned away with a gesture of 
dismissal. The crowd stirred but did 
not break up. It seemed reluctant to 
go away without some word of hope. 
But what word of hope could there 
be? 

H ARGREAVE was about to step 
off the platform, half angry at 
having been cajoled here to tell them 
that two plus two was four. Hardly 
anyone noticed the calm-faced, tall 
young man who threaded his way to- 
ward the rostrum and finally stepped 
on it. 

“Just a minute!” 

A hundred pairs of eyes swung 
about in surprise, stared at him curi- 
ously. The young man raised his 
yoice as he went on: 



“Professor Hargreave and gentle- 
men, I can tell you something about 
this phenomenon. I can tell you, for 
instance, why Earth is falling into 
the sun!” 

“You can tell us why?” Hargreave 
echoed, and all the crov/d echoed his 
words mentally. 

“Yes.” The young man looked at 
them blandly. He seemed perfectly 
at ease. He paled a little, though, as 
he sensed a sudden murderous mood 
arising in the group. How did he 
dare to stand there, calm and unafraid, 
at a time like this? 

His face became serious suddenly. 
“I can give you a reason for this 
event,” he said earnestly. 



CHAPTER II 
Man’s Fate 



SIMULTANEOUSLY, thousands 
of miles away, a drama concern- 
ing, not millions of men, but only two, 
was being played in lonely isolation. 

The steaming furnace of the jungle 
had been around them for three days 
— three sleepless, grueling days. At 
last Cabel turned like an infuriated 
animal. His gross, bearded face, 
sweaty and haggardly lined, v/orked 
savagely. 

“Damn you, Robinson, you’re kill- 
ing me!” he panted, sucking in the 
hot, miasmal air with straining lungs. 
“No sleep for two nights, just march, 
march, march ! I’m carrying both our 
packs, and when I want water, you 
torture me with a few drops. And 
these two bags of dust weigh a ton! 
I tel! you I can’t — I won’t go on!” 

The grin that came to young Burt 
Robinson’s face was diabolic. 

“I tell you you’re killing me!” 
screamed Cabel, making a desperate 
lunge. Burt side-stepped with a short, 
harsh laugh, and pulled out a pistol. 
It was Cabel’s own gun. Cabel, growl- 
ing, slid to one knee. He made a fu- 
tile attempt to hunch the double pack 
off his aching, tormented shoulders, 
but Burt’s knots held, as they had for 
three days. 

The younger man wiped his sweaty 



18

hands on his shirt, then took from his 
pocket a folded piece of paper, opened 
it up. In his clear script were the 
words : 

I confess to the murder of William 
Johnson, with a knife owned by Mayla, 
our native guide and porter, whom I also 
murdered. 

Signed 

“Ready to oblige?” rasped Burt, 
waving the paper. 

Cabel looked up, eyes like fevered 
coals between the matted hair hang- 
ing down over his forehead. 

“Never, damn you! I’m going to 
last this out, Robinson, see if I don’t. 
I’ve had twenty years of jungle, and 
it’s never beaten me yet. They don’t 
come any tougher than me. Come 
on!” 

Cabel forced himself to rocking 
legs and staggered along the fern- 
clogged trail. Burt put av/ay the pa- 
per and followed. Immediately, with 
their exertion, the frightful heat 
clothed them in almost unendurable 
suffocation. 

Stabbing rays of the sun, like mol- 
ten bars of steel, played a constant 
tattoo on their clothing, whichalready 
seemed on fire. Burt could not guess 
the temperature, but he swore to him- 
self it was the hottest day in history. 

But this torture of heat did not 
bother him as much as the fact that 
Cabel was bearing up miraculously, 
load, short water rations, and all. 
Burt frowned. Before nightfall they 
would reach the river. If Cabel did 
not crack before then, he might very 
well last it out. The row up the river 
would not be as much of a grind as 
this jungle trek. Was Cabel to win 
out in this grim game? 

At camp three days before, while 
Burt had been out hauling water from 
the spring, Cabel had knifed Bill 
Johnson in the back, and then had 
shot Mayla, the Indian porter, whose 
knife he had used. Burt Robinson 
had been saved by returning unex- 
pectedly by way of the rock path, sur- 
prising Cabel, and getting the drop 
on him. 

Burt had almost killed Cabel in 
rage, seeing Johnson’s agonized face. 



but he could not kill a man, even one 
like Cabel, in cold blood. Thereupon, 
he had decided to wring from him a 
confession to insure his punishment 
by law up at Koniko. Cabel had 
sneered confidently. Then they had 
started on this journey into Inferno, 
with Burt carrying the two guns and 
promising Cabel the worst five-day 
hell he had ever imagined. 

Burt had no pity for the stumbling, 
moaning man ahead of him. Pity for 
him? For three years he, Cabel and 
Bill Johnson, and faithful Mayla had 
worked their bonanza. Had sweated, 
toiled, laughed side by side. They 
had panned their dried, well hidden 
creek bed for one hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars in dust and small 
nuggets. Enough for all. Plenty! 

T hen Cabel, greed-ridden, had re- 
vealed the cupidity he had held 
in check for those three years. He 
had planned the triple murder, know- 
ing a story of attack by wild Indians, 
backed by a generous heap of dust, 
would carry at Koniko. 

What incredible fortitude kept 
Cabel on his feet after this three-day 
eternity of hellfire? Even Burt, un- 
encumbered, felt himself on the verge 
of sunstroke. And he was younger, 
stronger than Cabel. 

The two men crossed an open patch 
of lush-grown ground, and here the 
sun beat down with hammers of blind- 
ing flame. Burt could not resist a 
maddened urge to curse the fiery orb 
above. A huge, stinging drop of sweat 
touched one eyeball, burning it, so 
that he had to rub his eye clear, but 
he looked again. And again — raising 
his hand and peering through the fin- 
gers. His lips made a soundless ex- 
clamation of amazement. 

Cabel was moving on doggedly, 
head hanging. When they had crossed 
the clearing, Burt called a halt. Cabel 
threw himself, pack and all, on the 
sawgrass beside the trail, panting like 
a spent fox. His bloodshot eyes 
peered up mockingly from between 
the steaming tangle of his hair as 
Burt stood over him. 

“Haul out 3/our little paper, sonny,” 
sneered Cabel, “so I can spit at it.’’ 



THE JUDGMENT SUN

He drew the flap of leather that 
was his tongue between his cracked 
lips, 

Burt looked down at the murderer. 
“Cabel,” he said, sawing off the 
words, “you won’t live to enjoy the 
fortune we made. You’re going to 
face your Maker with blood fresh on 
your hands!’’ 

“Stow it!” croaked Cabel. “You 
haven’t the spunk to kill me.” 

“Cabel, look at the sun!” 

The murderer peered upward to- 
ward the sun. His first careless 
glance changed to a wide-eyed stare. 
An exclamation ripped from his heat- 
lacerated lips. 

“Good God! What’s the matter 
with the sun?” he gasped, “The heat’s 
got us — it looks too big!” 

“The heat’s going to get us, you 
mean!” hissed Burt steamily. “Cabel, 
do you know what that means that we 
see? It means the Earth is falling 
into the sun! It must have been go- 
ing on for hours, maybe days, but we 
didn’t notice. Except that I think 
you’ll agree this has been the hottest 
three days we’ve ever had, even in 
this Devil’s sinkhole.” 

Cabel’s haggard face showed his 
abysmal fear. “It can’t be!” he mum- 
bled, swallowing with a throat that 
had nothing to swallow. “Maybe it’s 
a — a mirage!” 

“Whatever it is,” retorted Burt 
grimly, “that’s going on between 
heaven and Earth, I’m not going to 
let up on you. Get going!” 

Burt, driving the murderer along 
pitilessly, saw at last a chance to 
break him. Let his tortured mind la- 
bor under the two burdens of secret 
murder and a burning doom, while 
the aching, sweating physical grind 
tore his nerves to shreds. 

When the afternoon sun, a huge 
bloated orb, reached its peak of hell- 
ish intensity, Cabel broke. Scream- 
ing like a madman, he flung himself 
tremblingly under a tree, as if to hide 
from the pitiless sun. 

“It’s growing!” he babbled. “I saw 
it with my own eyes — never heat like 
this before — coming down on us — 
Why did I kill Johnson! Blood! 
Bbod— ” 



T he confession was signed. They 
went on with Burt carrying his 
own pack. Burt had given Cabel his 
fill of water. It was not till an hour 
later that Burt realized the murderer 
had cracked completely. He listened, 
horrified, as the broken man in front 
hissed : 

“Damn you, sun, you won’t get me! 
They’re going to hang me — ” 

And Burt Robinson, rowing a grin- 
ning, vacant-eyed Cabel up the river, 
felt for the first time in full force the 
stunning realization of Earth’s doom. 
He had avenged the murder of his 
friend, but to what avail? 

“. . . if you can believe me, gentle- 
men,” earnestly finished the young 
man in knickers. The crowd had not 
stirred since he first had begun to 
speak. 

“Just who are you?” demanded 
Professor Hargreave. 

“Well, nobody,” confessed the 
young man with a wry grin. “That 
is, my name isn’t known except to my 
friends and relatives and the minister 
who baptized me. The name is Terry 
Blackwell. I’m an amateur astrono- 
mer, use an eight-inch refractor, 
home-made mounting.” 

“That’s neither here nor there.” 
Hargreave’s puffy, florid face was 
grim, sweat-beaded. “The thing is, 
what proof have you for your — ah — 
quite hare-brained explanation of this 
unprecedented phenomenon?” 

“Proof?” Terry Blackwell frowned 
a bit, “I have proof — of sorts. That 
is, I have a series of photographs of 
the ether-strain in the past three 
months of its approach toward the 
sun.” 

Professor Hargreave looked at him 
sternly. “And you didn’t reveal this 
knowledge, or theory at least, of yours 
till this last, fatal moment?” 

A look of angry pain came into the 
young man’s eyes. “This morning at 
5:15 a. m. I tried to get an audience 
at Yerkes,” he said slowly. “I was 
refused admittance! A month ago I 
wrote a letter to Yerkes, offering to 
show my photographs, but the reply 
v/as a cold refusal, signed by your- 
self ! It is not easy, I can assure you. 



20 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



for an amateur to gain a hearing.” 
The Yerkes astronomer flushed 
deeply. Hargreave remembered the 
letter vaguely, and recalled, too, that 
he had chuckled over it. Strange 
how little things could turn up with 
the devastating force of a hurricane, 
in the sweep of tumultuous events. 

“Well, we’l! see your photographs,” 
said Hargreave at last, gruffly. 
“Where are they?” 

“At my home — Geneva — hour’s 
drive,” responded Terry. “Perhaps 
we’d better hurry?” 

“Hurry — yes,” agreed the astrono- 
mer, jerking himself up. “Come, my 
car.” 



CHAPTER III 
Stars in Their Courses 



YEAR before Robert McClaugh, 
Ph.D., had said : “I believe my 
ten years of research are coming to a 
head. Atomic power lies just ahead!” 
Six months before he had stated : 
“The power of the atom can be re- 
leased by a suitable concentration of 
cosmic rays!” 

One month before he had cried ex- 
citedly: “Look, Vogel, my artificial 
cosmic rays already have the power to 
split the nitrogen atom!” 

A week before he had spoken nerv- 
ously; “Vogel, I dare not try it. Who 
knows but v/hat the release of total 
energy in even a thimbleful of gas 
might be the fuse to set the whole 
world aflame?” 

“But what are you going to do?” 
Vogel had asked. 

“Forget it for the time being,” Mc- 
Claugh had muttered. “Controlled 
atomic energy would be the world’s 
greatest blessing. But escaping, it 
would be world-destruction. Since I 
don’t know whether it is controllable 
with my ionized screen, I’ll have to 
work out a sure method. There can 
be no half-cocked guesswork with 
this demon-force.” 

And McClaugh, with Vogel’s assist- 
ance, had begun what might well be 
the task of years, to find a quencher 
that would as easily snuff atomic 



power as water puts out flame. 

Then something had occurred to 
put a new face on the whole thing. 
Vogel had announced it with a dazed 
expressionlessness. McClaugh had 
listened with a detached curiosity. 

“Come, come, man !” McClaugh 
scoffed at last. “What are you trying 
to say, that the earth is falling into 
the sun?” 

“I don’t know how else,” Vogel said 
doggedly, “you can explain the sun 
being four times or more its usual 
size!” 

“Why, you’re serious!” stated Mc- 
Claugh. Then he dashed outside his 
laboratory home to see for himself. 
Everything was lit by an unnatural 
brightness this hot morning. People 
hurried here and there with fear on 
their faces. McClaugh put up his 
hand and squinted at the sun between 
his fingers. It was unmistakably a 
larger sun than had ever shone on 
Earth in the history of man! 

“What do you think, sir?” Vogel 
asked when they went back inside. 
His lips trembled. He wiped perspi- 
ration from his forehead. 

“I think it’s splendid,” retorted 
McClaugh, %vithout sarcasm. 

Vogel stared. “But, professor, it 
means the doom of all Earth ! Every- 
one is going to die!” 

“Exactly, everyone is going to die.” 
The old scientist looked speculatively 
at his young assistant. “Vogel, do 
you think it would make much differ- 
ence if everyone died a few hours be- 
forehand? Would you, for instance, 
care much if you died now or three 
days later, if in both cases the deat’n 
was inevitable?” 

“Sir — I don’t understand — I — ” 

“Fool!” barked McClaugh in quick 
temper. “Naturally the quicker death 
is the more desirable. Death itself is 
not so terrifying; the suspense of 
waiting for it is far worse. Isn’t that 
so?” 

“Yes, sir. But we don’t know for 
sure the earth will plunge all the way 
to the sun. It may stop somewhere 
and take up a new orbit.” 

“That we must find out, Vogel. I 
want you to call up all the newspaper 
offices and radio stations and ask for 




THE JUDGMENT SUN 



21 



official reports, if any.” His eyes held 
a peculiar light. “In the meantime — ” 
He whirled on the motionless, dazed 
Vogel. “Well!” he roared. 

The young assistant ran like a 
frightened rabbit. A half hour later 
he sought the scientist and found him 
down in the basement workroom. 

“I’ve tried everywhere,” Vogel an- 
nounced: “There have been no offi- 

cial reports from, anywhere. The 
newspaper offices have pleaded with 
Yerkes for a statement, but they re- 
fuse as yet.” 

M cCLAUGH’S eyes still had a 
peculiar glint in them. “Do 
you know what that m.eans, Vogel? 
Their refusal to report means they 
fear the v/orst. The earth is going to 
fall into the sun!” 

“I called my mother, too,” m.ur- 
mured Vogel, biting his lip to hold 
back a scream that pressed in his 
throat. “She wants me to come home 
— frightened, I guess. May I go, 
sir?” 

“Yes, of course — of course.” The 
old scientist’s tone was preoccupied. 
He was busily engaged in examining 
the large electrical apparatus in the 
center of the room. 

“Professor, what did you mean a 
while ago when you asked if I would 
prefer — er, death now or later?” 
“Nothing. Nothing at all,” hummed 
the aged scientist. He looked up 
fiercely as the assistant stood there. 
“Well!” Vogel left with the echoes 
of that peremptory roar. 

As soon as the assistant left, Mc- 
Claugh ran to the door, locked it. 
Then he gazed at the apparatus with 
eagerness. Here was the machine 
that could rend asunder a mere puff 
of gas and extract from it untold 
power. But the proof of it lay in the 
trying, and so far he had not dared 
try. 

He had not dared to increase the in- 
tensity of his artificial cosmic ray 
beam to the point where it would not 
merely knock electrons loose from 
gas atoms, but disrupt the nucfei 
themselves! In the nuclei lay the in- 
conceivable hammer of atomic power. 
His cosmic rays were the hand that 



would wield that hammer. 

McClaugh’s heart began to pound 
madly, an hour later, when the appa- 
ratus had been made quite ready. One 
twist of that red dial and a Titan 
would leap from the machine. But 
would his screen of ionized mercury 
hold the vortex of potential force? 
Or would it burst free and — 

McClaugh hesitated at the last min- 
ute. His mind revolved again the 
train of thought that had brought 
him this far. Earth was doomed by 
an inexplicable fail toward the sun. 
If the vortex escaped and accom- 
plished its progressive disintegration 
of the earth, it would simply be a 
quicker doom. 

But what if Earth was not doomed 
by the sun? 

Sweating. McClaugh felt his mind 
whirling. The driving, all-consuming 
urge of ten years of striving toward 
this goal gathered itself and rolled 
forward like a juggernaut in his mind, 
mowing down all other considera- 
tions. 

Atomic power! Controlled atomic 
power or — holocaust! 

The low, powerful hum of the in- 
ternal transformers seemed to beat 
time to his throbbing thoughts. 
White-faced dials seemed to stare at 
him like watching eyes. Watching 
this man who had fate in his hands. 

Power or destruction? Which 
would it be? 

McClaugh grasped the red dial 
with a nervous hand. The die was 
cast. With a savage finality he twist- 
ed the rheostat control. He staggered 
back as a tremendous shock rocked 
the floor. The whine of great power 
sang through the apparatus. Mc- 
Claugh closed his eyes, waiting for 
the microcosmic explosion that would 
destroy a world. 

But the machine hummed steadily 
on ! 

He ran to the dials, face alight. 
They told their story — the story of 
ten billion watts accumulated within 
the mercury chamber. And it had 
held! He had succeeded in produc- 
ing controlled atomic power! The 
earth had a legacy of endless, costless 
power ! 



22 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



McClaugh grounded the mercury 
chamber, dazed in his triumph, and 
watched the dials show the slow out- 
pouring of ten billion watts into the 
capacious bosom of Earth. 

I^K^HEN suddenly his face contorted 
JB horribly. His eyes swam in a 
film of blood-tears. 

For in this moment of victory, a 
temporarily forgotten thought swept 
over him with crushing fury. 

Irony of ironies! He had given this 
great gift to a world that would have 
no chance to use it. For the earth was 
plunging into the sun! 

^ ^ ^ 

, . . Terry Blackwell shuffled 
through the pack of prints and finally 
picked out one. He handed it to Pro- 
fessor Hargr'eave. 




“That’s about the best I took,” 
Terry said. “It shows quite clearly 
the distortions of the star field, es- 
pecially around its edges.” 

Hargreave wiped a rivulet of sweat 
from his cheek, took the print eagerly. 

It showed a small portion of the 
night sky, with an appreciable dust- 
ing of stars. Just below center was 
noticeable a small patch in which the 
stars ran in curved streaks to form a 
circle. Within that circle the star 
images were superimposed on one an- 
other to form a mottled design. 

“The rest of these prints,” con- 
tinued Terry, “show the three months’ 
progress of the ether-strain among the 
background of constellations, as it 
slowly but surely approached the sun. 



I did not know how close it was till 
one night it occulted Jupiter — that is, 
it threw Jupiter’s image about three 
minutes of arc out of place. Then I 
knew it was comparatively close to 
Earth !” 

Hargreave and the officials with him 
looked over the prints carefully. One 
of the officials said finally ; 

“Couldn’t this be a fault in the lens 
of your camera, or in your telescope?” 

Strangely, it was Hargreave who 
took Terry’s part then. “No, because 
the distortion takes different posi- 
tions in the print, which could not be 
explained that way. Besides — besides. 
I seem to recall that several prints 
were ruined recently up at the Ob- 
servatory by distortions exactly like 
these. We thought it was in the pho- 
tographic paper and threw them 
away.” 

“That’s right !” said one of the offi- 
cials. “I remember that one print was 
ruined by a fault in Scorpio, about a 
month ago.” 

“June sixth, to be exact,” confirmed 
Terry, holding up the print for that 
date. If the group had had any seri- 
ous doubts left, they vanished utterl}' 
when this photograph showed the tail 
of Scorpio twisted out of place. 

Hargreave looked at Terry with 
something of deep respect. “Young 
man,” he said excitedly, “I think there 
isn’t any doubt about it any more. In- 
credible as it seems, your ether-strain 
theory must be right. It plunged into 
the solar system, or rather the solar 
system met up with it, and as a re- 
sult — ” 

They all knev/ the result — a great, 
menacing sun that had apparently 
burst its linear bonds and become a 
threat of doom over a world of crea- 
tures who were, in the last analysis, 
less bound by the laws of man than 
the laws of nature. 

Before a blanket of censorship had 
muffed the blarings of radio commen- 
tators an hour before, there had been 
stark reports of rioting hundreds, 
suicidal thousands, hysterical millions 
in Europe, which had already viewed 
the Brobdingnagian sun for twelve 
hours. What was happening in 
America, the Lord only knew. 



THE JUDGMENT SUN

Hargreave glanced at his watch. It 
was ten o’clock. Wiping off the sweat 
sprinkled over his boiled-looking skin 
with a limp and already saturated 
handkerchief, he gasped: 

“Telephone! Quickly!” 



CHAPTER IV 
Sunrise 



UTWARDLY, Jose Estaban was 
calm and proud, with his back 
against the high stone wall of the 
prison courtyard. If there were any 
mental worms gnawing at his brain, 
it did not show on his saturnine face 
with its mocking smile. He had been 
that way the night before, during the 
hasty military trial. 

The solemn, dark faces of the 
enemy had filled with hate as they 
turned to him. There had been the 
forma! recital of his many acts of 
espionage. Then the faces had turned 
to triumphant glee as the head-officer 
pronounced the sentence in cold, 
harsh tones : 

“Jose Estaban, known as El Disblo 
Espia, your crimes against the nation 
of Bolivia merit death. Fucilado a la 
solida del sol — you will be shot — at 
sunrise!” 

Jose Estaban looked up and saw the 
rosy fingers of approaching dawn 
tremble through the gloom. The ten 
men of the guard, at an order from 
their captain, made a right turn on 
their heels, and marched toward the 
farther wall, against which lay ten 
rifles. 

Jose stared stolidly ahead. El capi- 
tan stalked up. “Blindfold, senor?” 
He tendered a black cloth. 

Jose smiled the saturnine smile that 
had won him the name of the Devil 
Spy. 

“Save it, mi Capitan,” he murmured 
softly, “for mourning when el Chaco 
Boreal, the land for which we fight, 
passes into the hands of Paraguay!” 

“Brave words for a dead man!” 
leered the captain. He whirled and 
v.'alked to a position beside the ten 
riflemen. As he glanced impatiently 
out the east gate for the soon-to-rise 



sun, his lieutenant spoke in his ear; 

“Would it not be best, mi Capitan, 
to have the men fire right now, even 
though the sun has not yet risen, lest 
he escape in some way?” 

“The puerco will not escape.” 
“Five times before was he captured, 
and five times he escaped!” reminded 
the under-officer. He rolled his eyes, 
superstitiously. “They say the devil 
himself watches over this man. 
Caramba! Look — how he grins as he 
stands there, as though he expects 
not to die, but to have the laugh over 
us. The men are nervous, too, and — ” 
“Silence, perro!” hissed the Boliv- 
ian Captain. “There is no miracle can 
save him. We will wait for a punc- 
tual sun to give the signal of his 
death.” 

But as the slow minutes passed in 
ominous silence, with the flush of 
near-sunrise growing in strength, 
even the tough-souled captain became 
nervous. The men fidgeted, shuffled 
their feet. 

The lieutenant stood with mouth 
half open, as if prepared at any mo- 
ment to see the devil himself arrive 
and whisk his protege away. For el 
Diablo Espia had been almost a myth 
for two years, one whose activities 
had been devilishly cunning. 

In the gloom, the spy’s eyes seemed 
to gleam like small fires. His lips 
were curled in mockery. Suddenly 
his eyes flicked to the east-gate, and 
widened slightly. For there he saw a 
girl, white arms straining to tear 
down the solid bars of steel. At the 
same time the tip of the sun peeped 
over the horizon, and a shaft of 
brightness speared into the shadowy 
courtyard. 

El capitan, awaiting this signal, 
raised an arm. The riflemen brought 
up their guns, took aim. A scream in- 
tercepted the word: “fucil — ” 

The Bolivian captain glanced to- 
ward the gate, saw the girl, and mo- 
tioned for the men to lower their 
rifles. El capitan, was of the old 
school, with chivalry deeply imbedded 
in his nature. He strode toward the 
girl at the east-gate. 

"Senorita, I beg of you to depart 
for the time. It is no pretty sight, 




24 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



this. Particularly for so charming a 
girl!” 

"^^ARK eyes aflame, the girl spoke 
tremulously: 

“Mi Capitan, please do not kill this 
man. Make him a prisoner instead, till 
the war is over I” 

“Catamba! Are you mad? He is 
our nation’s worst enemy!” 

“Then let me go to him — die with 
him!” pleaded the girl wildly. “I 
love him — I sheltered him for many 
days, before he was captured, so I am 
a traitor to Bolivia! Do you hear? 
You must kill me with him because 
I am a traitor!” 

“Diablo! That is impossible, sen- 
orita. I will not believe it. More, it 
is foolishness. You cannot die with 
him.” 

“Then let me be with him for a tiny 
moment ! I will do anything, any- 
thing, if you will grant me that!” 

The stern look on the Bolivian’s 
face dissolved to reflection. “You love 
this man, si? You will do anything to 
be with him for a moment, si? You 
will, perhaps, let me do all in my 
power to comfort you — afterward? 
Comprendo, lovely one?” 

Soft, black eyes tragic, the girl 
nodded. “Let me in to him and you 
will not regret it.” 

Grinning in satisfaction, the cap- 
tain called for one of his men to open 
the steel gate. “But one minute I will 
give you,” he admonished the girl. 
Like a bird seeking its nest, the girl 
ran to Jose, enfolded him in trembling 
arms. 

The doomed man lifted up her face, 
kissed her tenderly. “In some after- 
life we will be reunited, Nina. Our 
love cannot die.” 

They clung to one another fiercely 
for a moment, then Jose pushed her 
away firmly. “But go now. Death 
awaits me.” 

“O mi dies! Then with you I die!” 
The girl flung herself about, faced the 
firing squad with her body in front 
of his. 

At the other side of the courtyard, 
the men watching this scene ex- 
changed glances. The Devil Spy’s 
doom was being delayed, as if death 



itself were reluctant to take him. 

A flood of rays from the east gate 
now lit up the tableau with supernal 
brightness. The girl’s white clothes 
seemed to expand into a blazing cloak 
that hid the man behind. El capitan 
cursed and started forward. 

When he had gone half way, a dark 
streak plunged toward the east gate. 
It was el Diablo Espia making a run 
for the steel portal that had been care- 
lessly left unlocked after the entrance 
of the girl! 

“Shoot him — kill him!” screamed 
the Bolivian captain, frantically jerk- 
ing out his own pistol. 

The distance v/as a hundred feet. 
Of the ten men t’nat brought up their 
rifles, one must surely have aimed 
true. But only one bullet was fired, 
that of el capitan, and it failed to stop 
the flying man, even though it made 
a trail of spattered blood over the 
grey cobblestones. 

The rest of the men stood staring 
toward the east-gate, watched el Dia- 
blo Espia escape from it. It was not 
him they watched, however. 

It was the incredible thing beyond. 

T heir widening, dazed eyes be- 
held the enormous bulk of an en- 
chanted sun now hanging just over 
the horizon. It was the color of the 
droplets of blood that marked the es- 
caped spy’s trail. Misshapen by re- 
fraction, it floated there like the Gar- 
gantuan heart of some celestial Cy- 
clops. Cloud wisps scurrying by made 
it seem to pulsate with nameless life. 

It was a wizard’s trick and the Bo- 
livian riflemen, as they reeled back in 
fright, had no doubt that it was the 
doing of the devil himself, to insure 
the escape of his ward, the Devil Spy!

. . , Professor Hargreave slammed 
down the receiver in disgust. “Can’t 
get Washington for love or money!” 
he said explosively. “I suppose every 
crank and fool in the country is on 
the wire. Talk about a voice crying 
in the wilderness — ” 

He jumped to his feet. “But some- 
thing has to be done! You, Bradley,

fast as you can. Get a general mes-

sage over the radio if you have to 
buy out a station! We can’t let any- 
thing stop us. Kincaid, you take a 
plane for Washington and get to 
somebody high up if you have to mur- 
der to do it. In the meantime, I’ll try 
to get a call on the phone through, so 
one of the three of us ought to get our 
message across. Get going, men!” 
The tvro men dashed out, faces set 
in determination. Hargreave turned 
immediately to the telephone, barking 
into it viciously. When long distance 
had completed his connection, he 
rapped : 

“Dr. Morris Birge, Director of 
Biology — hurry !” 

Over his shoulder he said half 
mumblingly to Terry: 

“He’s a government man. Agricul- 
tural Bureau. Connections in — what!” 
For a moment he listened, then hung 
up slowly. His eyes were pained as 
he turned to Terry. 

“Suicide!” he muttered dazedly. 
“An hour ago — swallowed a dose of 
curare. My friend. One night he con- 
fided in me that his wild, passionate 
youth weighed heavily on his mind. 
But for him to — ” 

The astronomer’s eyes changed sud- 
denly. He grabbed up the phone 
again, hopefully. A few minutes later 
he jumped to his feet with a curse. 

“Velter dead too!” he groaned. 
“Shot this morning during a jailbreak, 
at Joliet prison. He was a G-man, hot 
on the trail of somebody down there. 
Now he’s gone too. I don’t know who 
to try next for a contact at the White 
House. But I must have it!” 
“Maybe I can help!” cried Terry. 
He continued at Hargreave’s gruff 
“Well?” 

“Wisconsin’s Senator Jordan has a 
summer home here in Geneva. Just 
down the street. If he’s home — ” 
“Come on!” shouted Hargreave, 
pushing his two-hundred-pound bulk 
toward the door at an actual run. 
They went out into the hot afternoon. 
Since dawn the overgrown sun had 
increased its girth by another diam- 
eter. It was now nine times as large 
in face area as normally! The heat 
teemed insufferable. 

“That’s the house there,” pointed 



Terry, and a moment later they were 
panting up the steps of a broad, 
shaded verandah. 

“Pray God he’s here!” exclaimed 
Hargreave fervently. 

CHAPTER V 
Cosmic Laughter 

HE God of Irony looked down on 
.Earth that day and laughed. He 
saw a world of creatures disturbed 
from their normal pursuit of life, and 
it was funny to watch their painful 
antics. 

In New York, a drunk who had 
made his usual nightly rounds, saw 
the dawn of an impossible sun and 
laughed himself to sleep on some- 
body’s doorstep in the thought that 
pink elephants and snakes were passe. 

Near Chicago, two gangsters re- 
turning from a “ride” with blood fresh 
on their hands, stared amazedly, su- 
perstitiously, at the blood-red Titan 
sun, and ran head-on into a milk truck, 
dying instantly. 

The God of Irony laughed louder. 

A young man, up all night in his 
shabby rent-due room, bitterly con- 
vinced that life was not worth living 
if one could not work and eat, with- 
drew the fatal blade from near his 
throat at the sound of outside shout- 
ing that came with the dawn, and 
when learning of the sun-doom, 
cursed the fate that was inevitably 
going to end his life while he was so 
young. 

After three days and nights of un- 
selfish, sleepless labor, their rescue 
tunnel reached the cave-in and they 
brought up the buried miner in the 
dawn of that fateful day, and his 
tears of joy and relief changed into a 
raging curse when he learned that he 
had escaped one doom only to be in 
time for another. 

An early bird evangelist, harangu- 
ing a gullible audience, gleefully 
launched into his pet theme of hellfire 
and brimstone, from which there was 
no escape except through becoming 
the soul of purity and repentance tha*: 
he was, but one could never describe 




26 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



the strange green color of his apo- 
plectic face when the sun-doom be- 
came manifest. 

A patient, earnest astronomer gave 
a shout of joy to the amazement of 
his colleague, who had just announced 
the news of Earth falling intothesun, 
and exulted: “Now I’ll get superlative 
photographs of the sunspots, perhaps 
solve their mystery!” 

Brushing back his long hair, the 
starving poet again invaded the 
offices of the News. This time the 
weary editor accepted some of his 
work, thinking: 

"Any junk will do for a filler to- 
day.” And, at the same time that the 
poet inw'ardly exulted : 

“Perhaps, at long last, they see what 
I am trying to say. Maybe this is a 
beginning — for me — ” 

The God of Irony was now doubled 
up with uncontrollable mirth. . . . 

A prima donna threw back her head 
and sang to the small, music-thirsty 
audience, sang as never before — sang 
in the face of certain doom, glorious- 
ly, triumphantly — with magnificent 
defiance, strangely free of the haunt- 
ing fear that her voice was failing. 
For the first time in months — years— 
she was giving a performance of real 
brilliance — a performance that was to 
go down into oblivion! 

Destined to produce a masterpiece, 
an author scribbled away madly all 
day in his locked room, unaware of 
the doom that threatened to make his 
production worthless. 

A L, the janitor, awoke with great 
joy in his heart, for the day 
before he had cashed in his $50,000 
sweepstake’s ticket, and today he 
would begin spending it in glori- 
ous abandonment, but an hour later 
little lights of madness came into his 
eyes as the overbrilliant sunlight 
shone on a fistful of green papers with 
numbers on them. 

The God of Irony cast his merry 
eyes over the rest of the world to see 
what other insanely amusing things 
there were among these queer beings 
who had Mind and Imagination. . . . 

Down in Africa, two warring, 
bloodthirsty tribes spent the day 



watching the fantastic puffed sun 
with superstitious eyes, but as night 
came, they fell to their fighting with 
unabated vigor, in the light of a full 
moon. 

The Mandarin smoothed his silken 
robes thoughtfully after hearing that 
the Celestial Fire was about to con- 
sume Earth for its sins, then ordered 
his frightened servants out, bidding 
them go to the writings of Confucius 
for comfort, and when alone he took 
a strong pair of shears to clip off the 
four-inch long finger nails that had 
secretly irked him all his life. 

"Marsch!” shouted the Nazi Kom- 
mandant, and when a white-faced 
under-officer pointed mutely up at 
the super-sun, the Kommandant shook 
his head fiercely, saying: 

“This all day marching drill with 
full pack, goes on should Hell itself 
come to Earth! Marsch!” 

Babbitt had had a wonderful two 
weeks in the South Seas — idle days, 
soft moonlit nights, dark-eyed women, 
music, it had been heavenly, and when 
awakened at noon, the news struck 
him like a physical blow, so that he 
wailed : 

“I knew it couldn’t last!” 

The God of Irony had had a mar- 
velous day, hut his laughter stopped 
suddenly. . . . 

Oogli, the Eskimo, up in the far 
Arctic, went complacently on with his 
fishing and skinning, for the sun 
could not rise here to astonish him 
for two more months of night-time. 

Up in the mountains, the blind her- 
mit continued to fill his simple, con- 
tented soul with the poetry of bab- 
bling brooks and caroling birds, bliss- 
fully unconscious of the huge, glow- 
ering sun over his head. 

And a park-bench philosopher, 
typical of his kind, watched the mad- 
ness of panic-stricken mankind with 
a secret pity that they were so fearful 
of death. 

^ ^ 

Senator James Jordan came to the 
door in a maroon bathrobe over paja- 
mas whose brilliantly striped pant 
legs showed at the bottom. He 
yawned. 

“Up late last night — or this morn-

ing,” he explained with an apologetic 
grin. “Wife’s away. Guess I’m alone 
in the house. Funny Mrs. Riggs — our 
housekeeper — hasn’t showed up yet. 
Damned hot this morning. Well, 
what can I do for you gentlemen?’’ 

He started as he looked again at 
their faces. “Say, what’s up? You 
two look like the end of the world is 
coming.” 

“Not we two — the world looks like 
that,” said Hargreave dryly. He 
pointed through the foliage of the tall 
trees that shaded the porch. “Look at 
that sun!” 

^ENATOR JORDAN’S sleepy 
look changed to startled bewild- 
erment with the speed of a lightning 
flash. He rubbed his eyes, looked 
again, then turned dazedly to his 
visitors. 

“The earth is falling into the 
sun !” 

“The earth is falling into the sun, 
of course,” said Hargreave impa- 
tiently, perhaps a little sneering^y at 
the senator’s helplessness, he who 
could harangue election crowds for 
hours over nothing at all. “There’s a 
story be’nind this that I can’t go into 
now. Time’s too short. What I’m here 
for is a telephone connection with the 
White House. In fact, with the 
President himself, or Secretary of 
War, or somebody in high authority. 



Senator, I’ve got to have it! What 
can you do?” 

The senator managed to shake off 
his bewilderment, and to quell the icy 
panic in his heart. He put through a 
call on the phone, when they had en- 
tered the house. After forty minutes 
of sweating, shouting, blustering 
effort, while Hargreave and Terry 
stood by anxiously, Jordan announced 
that he had the Secretary of State’s 
office on the wire. 

Hargreave , grabbed the phone 
eagerly, began speaking with the 
v/ords coming out in a tumble. 

In a period of twenty-four hours, 
the incredible, overgrown sun had re- 
vealed itself to all the peoples of 
Earth, from Greenwich to far India, 
from the Arctic to the Antipodes. 
And as it climbed the skies, it grew 
ever larger and fiercer, and in like 
degree, the people’s fears grew larger 
and fiercer. 

For a while things went calmly. 
Centuries and ages of civilizing re- 
straint became a bulv/ark against ris- 
ing terror and madness. Authorities 
broadcast soothing, but unconvincing, 
statements that the earth would un- 
doubtedly take up a new orbit. 

There were little cases of violence 
and madness here and there that grew 
with the rapidity of an explosion. A 
reign of terror started. The less re-

the secret is? Well, many things go to 
make up success. But one thing is abso-

And constipation is contrary to per- 
fect health. It can rob you of looks, 
energy, ambition ! You’re likely to pass

important. Instead of taking a laxative

your stomach, take gentle Ex-Lax. 

Ex-Lax limits its action entirely to the 
intestines, where the actual constipa-

THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



strained, more panicky element of 
Earth’s population cast all judgment 
to the wind and became maddened 
beasts. Bloodshed and violence spread 
their gory fingers over the world. A 
tidal wave of insanity, suicide and 
lawlessness followed the giant sun 
around the planet. The puny barriers 
of law and order, sufficient ordinarily, 
were as though non-existent before 
this new wave of world-panic. 

“Everyone is going to die!’’ 

That was the terrible sword that be- 
gan to lay civilization low. If every- 
one was going to die in a few hours 
or days, what did anything matter ? 
What did law and order and morality 
mean ? Nothing, in the face of this 
cataclysmic doom! 

It was a black page in the history 
of civilization that day. As the su- 
per-sun rose to midday heights over 
any certain longitude, the masses un- 
derneath launched into reckless ca- 
reers. Each did as his buried inclina- 
tions dictated, without regard for 
others. The most secret of inhibi- 
tions came to light of day. 

Murder, rapine, insanity stalked the 
lands. Fires, riots, mob violence 
swelled the day’s mad doings. Feats 
of heroism and sacrifice occurred 
side by side with unnameable 
atrocities. Sun-cults sprang up and 
grevz to giddy heights in the course 
of a few hours. 

Unnumbered homes were emptied 
whose occupants would never again 
come back. Thousands of children 
cried piteously for parents who were 
dead or missing. Saints were born 
that day, and devils. A legion of 
Good Samaritans struggled to allay 
the pain and torture and misfortune 
that rode the world roughshod. 

There were those who preached, 
and those who comforted, and those 
who spread calm like oil on troubled 
waves. 

But there were those many who 
sadistically set about displaying their 
twisted mental complexes. 

A nd over it all rode the monster 
sun, symbol of doom. 

Its actual effect was more mental 
than anything, for neither the in- 



creased heat or light could account 
for what went on. It was just its con- 
stant, inexorable, insidious presence 
overhead that pressed on shocked 
brains. An earthquake strikes the 
heart with sharp terror, but leaves the 
mind free to think ahead to eventual 
escape, barring bad luck. But this im- 
mense sun, this sun of doom, grow- 
ing ever larger, sucking the earth into 
its maw of superflame, left no room 
for hope. 

From the pulpit it was called the 
Judgment Sun, coming down to ful- 
fill the prophecy of the Day of Doom. 

The way things were going, the 
civilized world would be a shambles 
by evening of that first day. What 
it would be the next day, no one dared 
speculate. The final, unthinkable pic- 
ture was that of a planet half of 
whose population was dead, and the 
other half insane — plunging sunward. 

And where was the word of hope? 
Where was an Atlas to come to the 
rescue and hold up the falling Heav- 
ens? Or was Earth inevitably 
doomed? 

At about one o’clock in the middle 
of the V/estern Hemisphere, a con- 
certed gasp went up from the land. 
A spark had been ignited at Yerkes 
and spread from there like wildfire. 
A second spark had grown at Wash- 
ington and its greater flood of waves 
spanned the Atlantic, and later the 
Pacific. 

The pulse that began to beat strong- 
ly at Washington set up resonant 
pulses in London, Paris, Berlin, Mos- 
cow, and finally Bombay, Hongkong, 
Tokyo, Sydney, Capetown. From 
these centers the blessed spark spread 
from city to city, from community to 
community, by radio, telegraph, tele- 
phone and the printed page. 

A great hush came over Earth. Its 
furious travail ceased. Dazed eyes 
dimmed with tears. Torn hearts ceased 
to bleed. Shrieks turned to soft sobs. 
Terror gave way to relief. Fear 
vanished into shame. 

People whispered the news to one 
another — 

Earth is not doomed ! The in- 
creased size of the sun is an illusion^, 
There is nothing to worry about!

CHAPTER VI 
End of the Doom 



T he prayer of thanks that arose 
from millions of hearts must have 
inundated the Elysian shores of 
heaven above. 

But the God of Irony laughed most 
over this, for he had seen the grim- 
mest Play in all history enacted with 
a backdrop of Illusion! 

He had watched scientists take heat 
measurements early in the day and 
find a barely noticeable increase in 
the average heat. They had tried to 



had made triangulation calculations 
that night -with the planets and had 
found nothing changed from normal. 
But their message, although faster 
than the super-sun’s course around 
Earth, had made no impression, for 
wasn’t it likely that all the planets, as 
well as Earth, were falling toward the 
sun? 

Numerous other little things — each 
sufficient in itself to prove the illu- 
sion to the reasoning mind — revealed 
the cosmic hoax: gravity and tide ob- 
servations, light pressure tests, the 
paradoriical exactness of sunrise. 

But they had gone unheeded, these 
prophets of the illusion, for in one

spread the word that Earth could not 
be nearer the sun, but to no avail. 

By a mad coincidence, that fateful 
day had been one of the hottest of 
the year. The imagination of man’s 
mind had swelled the temperature to 
unreasoning heights! Seeing is be- 
lieving — never before had that plati- 
tude been demonstrated with more ir- 
resistible force! 

Observatories in Asia, v/hich conti- 
nent had first seen the phenonienon, 



detail they had all failed in their mes- 
sage to Earth's unreasoning multi- 
tudes. Not one of them had thought 
to give a reason for the illusion.

its sudden universal acceptance to the 
fact that it accounted for the illusion, 
as well as named it such.

demanded a hero of worship for the 
soothing message of peace. He tried 
to escape it, but at midnight found 
himself standing before a microphone 
on a worldwide hookup. 

“What shall I say?" gulped Terry 
nervously. 

Professor Hargreave smiled indul- 
gently. “It doesn’t matter much what 
you say. You could say boop-boop-a- 
doop and they would take it for 
pearly wisdom. But you may as well 
give the world a resume of your whole 
theory, just about as you gave it up 
at Yerkes this morning.” 

“But the theory is wild guesswork,” 
pleaded Terry. “It happens to ac- 
count for the illusion, by luck, per- 
haps. I’m not a real scientist at all. 
I—” 

“If you’re not a real scientist, I’d 
like to meet one,” said Hargreave. He 
signaled to the commentator. The 
latter, who had been frantically wav- 
ing for them to approach the micro- 
phone, and had been filling the time 
with the usual play-up, sighed in re- 
lief. 

“People of Earth!” he concluded, 
realizing the tremendousness of the 
occasion in that phrase, “People of 
Earth — I give you now — Mr. Terry 
Blackwell, the young man who this 
day proved the great illusion!” 

ffW ADIES and gentlemen, it was 
about three months ago,” 
Terry began, “that I photographed 
Saturn with my eight-inch refractor 
telescope. The print showed a small, 
faint distortion in one corner. The 
next night I tried again and found an 
identical fault in the photograph. 

“From then on, with more luck 
than skill, I succeeded in trailing the 
almost unnoticeable distortion photo- 
graphically as it moved across the 
stars. It was quite invisible by visual 
observation. I followed it with pho- 
tography for those three months and 
unmistakably it grew larger and more 
pronounced ! 

“One evening it cama abreast of 
Jupiter, magnified it, and threw it out 
of line, as well as the immediate field 
of stars. That indicated that this 
giysterious enigma was close to 



us, already between Earth and 
Jupiter. 

“Not having the necessary mathe- 
matical skill to plot its course, I had 
no idea it would eventually come be- 
tween Earth and sun. But it did, and 
in doing so, caused the enlargement 
of the sun we have observed. 

“About a week ago I started seri- 
ously thinking of an explanation for 
it. What strange thing, at least the 
size of the sun, transparent but high- 
ly refractive, could be drifting 
through space? Since it was com- 
pletely uncatalogued in modern sci- 
ence, I had a clear field in which to 
speculate. As a result, I’ve worked 
out a theory for it which later scien- 
tific research m.ay modify, but it is 
this; 

“Somewhere and sometime in the 
cosmos, a dense and dark star like the 
companion of Sirius, collided with an- 
other large star and v/as knocked out 
of its normal orbit in the universe, or 
fused with it to become a nova. This 
dead star must have been incredibly 
dense, perhaps half composed of neu- 
tronium which weighs sixty million 
tons to the cubic inch. And its gravi- 
tational field must have been immeas- 
ureably stronger than any we know. 
So strong, in fact — ” 

Terry drew a long breath and con- 
tinued, for he knew that hundreds of 
astronomers and other scientists 
would be listening: 

“So strong, in fact, that the warp 
it produced in space became perma- 
nent ! Thus, when the dead star itself 
was knocked away, the ether-strain 
it had made went on in the old orbit! 
Like the shell of a nut continuing to 
exist long after the kernel which grevy 
it has been eaten awav by worms. 

“The collision itself may have hap- 
pened untold trillions of years ago, 
and perhaps in some other galaxy. 
But the ether-strain pursued its lone 
course, unaffected by the laws that 
govern the rest of the universe, and 
came finally to our galaxy and our 
Solar System. 

“By deduction from its low ve- 
locity, it must have entered the Solar 
System, within the orbit of Pluto, 
about five years ago. But it would 



THE JUDGMENT SUN 



31 



have been impossible to detect it then, 
for even so bright an object as the sun 
looks merely like a star from Pluto’s 
distance. And this ether-strain is ab- 
solutely invisible. 

“It was not detectable till it had 
approached quite near — within one- 
half billfbn miles — and then only as a 
faint smudge on a sensitive photo- 
graphic plate. So it may be said that 
the ether-strain sneaked up on us like 
an invisible snake. I count it only as 
great good luck that I happened to 
catch it on my plate, since it only took 
up about one millionth of the total 
sky area! 

“After entering the Solar System, 
and because its velocity relative to 
the sun was just a little more than 
Earth’s orbital velocity, it contrived 
to hang in between Earth and sun for 
these many hours. Its huge area is 
very gradually drawing ahead of the 
Earth and will in a few hours un- 
doubtedly clear away. 

“There is only one thing left to 
mention and explain: the way it mag- 
nified the sun’s image. The effect of 
such a magnification will be under- 
stood if it is compared to a telescope 
lens with a high refractive index, but 
a very long focus. Like a giant hand- 



glass, this sphere of warped space 
hung between the direct rays of the 
sun and Earth, and bent the light rays 
to a focus for Earthly eyes. 

“The ether-strain has the ability to 
bend light, in accordance with Ein- 
stein’s laws, but in a greater degree 
than ever observed before, because its 
warp of space is greater than we have 
ever known. Paradoxically, this warp 
does not have any gravitational influ- 
ence, as it should have, for Einstein 
says the force of gravity is simply a 
curvature of space. This can be ex- 
plained by assuming that when space 
has been abnormally warped, its gravi- 
tational effects link into a closed 
circle, no longer able to exert exter- 
nal influence. 

“And so,” concluded Terry, “this 
extremely startling phenomenon in 
our skies today has been merely an 
optical illusion!” 

Hargreave had a moment before he 
received a paper from the announcer. 
He stepped before the microphone, as 
Terry backed away. 

“The Kioto Observatory in Japan,” 
he read, “reports that the sun that has 
just risen over their land is once again 
normal. The phenomenon lasted ex- 
actly twenty-eight hours.”

T he sentinels of the tree people 
crouched in the highest branches 
of their communal dwelling 
place and stared fearfully toward the 
west. 

Beneath them the activities of the 
tree village were stilled. Men, women 
and children crouched on quivering 
haunches, each near a tree bole up 
which quick ascent could be made if 
necessary. The strings of tough vines 
crudely fastened from tree to tree, 
making a sort of rough platform 
thirty feet above the teeming ground, 
were empty. The hairy, mighty- 
thewed folk crouched, and stared as 
the sentinels in the treetops above did 
— toward the west. 

There, where the white-hot sun was 
dying, was the danger source. From 
there death came; death on two colos- 
sal hind legs, towering as high as a 
tree itself. 

When the hairy tree people built 
their aerial village thirty feet above 
the death-infested ground, they had 
hoped to know a new safety. For a 
while they had. The saber-toothed 
tiger, the monstrous serpent, the great

THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE

bear, were baffled by that height. They 
could be beaten off by stone ax and 
club before they reached it. 

But this new menace, which threat- 
ened the very race, made a mockery 
of their sanctuary. 

In the highest branch of the conifer 
tree in the center of the aerial vil- 
lage crouched Taljuck the Quick. 
Near him was the gorillalike form of 
Ank, strongest man of the tribe, 
Ank’s thick lips moved, and gut- 
tural, chattering sounds were articu- 
lated through his heavy, protruding 
jaws. It was not language; it was a 
series of symbolic sounds painting 
simple pictures of the mind. 

“You think the Great One will come 
on this sun-death?” 

Taljuck grunted. His jaws were 
not quite so bestial as those- of the 
other hairy folk. His forehead was a 
little higher? his eyes a little clearer. 
His enormous, hairy hands tightened 
on the odd contrivance he had made 
during the last four days. 

“Who can say? Sometimes the 
Great One comes, sometimes it does 
not. But when it does come, it is al- 
ways at this hour.” 

Ank’s muddy, brutish eyes went to 
the queer invention in Taljuck’s 
hands. 

“You are going to try that on the 
Great One?” 

“Yes. If it comes.” 

¥ ALUCK looked at the new 
weapon born of his brain. Fierce 
pride was in his eyes. 

It was a tough, curved length of 
wood nearly four inches through. 
From end to end of this was a tiger 
tendon, scraped, as thick as his little 
finger. A long straight stick with a 
sharp stone was tied to one end. 

Taljuck placed the blunt end of the 
stick on the tendon, stretched the 
heavier stick in a great arc, then re- 
laxed it. The bow and arrow had 
been born, of Taljuck’s brain, though 
its birth was not to be credited for 
thousands of centuries; and through 
it, Taljuck’s tribe was to reign su- 
preme for the lives of ten thousand 
succeeding generations. 

“This cannot kill so great a beast 



at once. But it can pass through the 
throat and later the thing will die.” 

“You can send that stick through 
the Great One’s throat?” echoed Ank. 

Taljuck fingered the pointed stone 
at the end of the crude arrow. Eons 
later, men were to find that and think 
it a peculiarly shaped ax-head, not 
realizing the enormous muscles of the 
men that could use it as an arrow- 
head. 

“It will pierce the fhroat. I know 
what it can do — ” 

A scream arose from below. It came 
from the downy lips of a young girl — 
Sor, the Far-Seeing. 

“It comes! It comes! I see the 
Great One’s head!” 

The tree people rushed here and 
there, chattering like great apes. One 
child fell; the hairy mother swung 
monkeylike to the ground, caught up 
her offspring, clambered to the 
heights again. 

To the heights — that did not protect 
against so huge a thing as the Great 
One! 

The sentinels, biggest and strongest 
men of the tree folk, grunted ex- 
citedly to one another. All but Tal- 
juck. Taljuck was silent, bracing 
himself in the tree-fork with hairy 
legs while his great hands flexed and 
loosed the bow and arrow, first of 
Man’s great inventions. 

In the semi-circle made by the 
white sun sinking over the horizon, a 
head appeared. It was a reptilian 
head, colossal, its gaping jaws studded 
with huge teeth. A short, vast throat 
appeared, then the rest of the body. 

The body was a mountain of lizard- 
flesh and bone carried on two incon- 
ceivably enormous legs, with a great 
tail to help its blundering balance. It 
hitched over the ground, crushing 
young trees, making the steamy earth 
tremble. And as it neared the tree 
village it reared higher, so that its 
incredible head was above the level of 
the hairy people’s sanctuary. 

The Great One, they called it. Long, 
long later it was to be named, from 
its remains. Tyrannosaurus rex, the 
most ferocious animal ever known. 
This was an anachronism, perhaps the 
last of its kind on Earth, a freak sur- 



S4 THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



vivor o£ a species supposed to have 
died out miliions of years before the 
appearance of the hairy folk. 

But the tree people did not know 
that. All they knew was that sud- 
denly, moons ago, this enormous 
thing had appeared over the skyline 
at sunset, stalked to their village, and 
taken five of their number as a tall 
man might pluck five green gourds 
in a high tree and gulp them down. 
Since then the Great One had come at 
irregular intervals, and always four 
to seven of their number went down 
that tremendous maw. 

Bowing to the Great One and wor- 
shiping it, giving it sacrifices volun- 
tarily, had not placated it. The tribe 
was in danger of extinction — unless 
Taljuck’s two sticks could somehow 
save it. 

To the highest branches scuttled 
the tree folk, there to cling like furred 
fruit. But the highest branches were 
not high enough. The trees, mighty 
of girth, were not lofty. A roaring 
whoosh of air was expelled from the 
Great One’s throat, and its basilisk 
eyes fastened on Sor, the Far-Seeing. 

CREAM after scream ripped from 
her lips. Her face, just becom- 
ing downy with the fine hairs of 
adolescence, was the color of a lizard’s 
belly. The other tree folk chattered 
and moaned. Taljuck bent the great 
bow. 

The Great One’s jaws gaped as it 
lumbered toward the tree in which 
Sor clung, paralyzed. Vine cat-walks 
were swept away like thread by the 
monster’s bulk. There was a last 
shriek, a dry clashing of teeth — 

“Taljuck! Strike!’’ Ank grunted 
in anguish. 

In the hands of Taljuck the Quick, 
the big bow quivered at its full arc. 
But the Great One was yards from his 
perch. He did not yet send the long 
stick, with the sharp stone on it, sing- 
ing forth as he had learned to do in 
the days before. 

The tyrannosaurus, as though drawn 
'ay Taljuck’s appalled but steady eyes, 
turned toward his tree. It lumbered 
there. Ank chattered, and shrie’sed 
in ihe tree beside him. 



“Strike! Taljuck! Strike!’’ 

But still, with steady eyes, Taljuck 
held the arrow taut on the tiger ten- 
don. The Great One crashed within 
ten yards. 

Shrilling despairing cries, Ank 
loosed his hold and fell plummetlike 
to earth, risking death by the fall 
rather than face the monster longer. 
He moaned and grunted on the ground 
with both legs broken so t’ne bone pro- 
truded through the hairy flesh, which 
meant lingering instead of quick 
death. 

And Taljuck, with a grunt, released 
his stone-tipped stick. 

With a thin shriek the arrow 
cleaved the air. The sharp stone hit 
the leather-armored throat of the 
Great One and went on in. The arrow, 
driven by a force such as is unknown 
to any muscular framework of man 
today, buried itself almost to its blunt 
end in the lizard’s flesh. 

The monster stopped its rush. Its 
short front legs went up and its claws 
raked at the thing that stuck out like 
a splinter from its streaming neck. 
Then, with an ear-splitting scream of 
air from its cavernous body, it came 
on — toward Taljuck. 

Taljuck clung to his tree-fork, as 
paralyzed as Sor had been. The Great 
One was not at all harmed by the 
arrow, it seemed. Dimly its low- 
ordered nervous system informed its 
tiny brain that it had been hurt; but 
its vast strength was unimpaired. 

It got to Taljuck’s tree, lunged 
against it, reached for the hairy 
human midge with gaping jaws. Tai- 
juck the Quick stared at the gaping 
maw which was streaming gouts of 
red from the transfixing arrow. The 
great bow dropped from his nerveless 
hands. 

From other high points, the tree folk 
screamed and chattered and moaned. 
The branch on which Taljuck had 
been was empty. It quivered still with 
the force of clutching hands that had 
been torn from it, and that was all. 

Taljuck the Quick, first inventor, 
was pulp in the tooth-studded mouth. 
But what was this? 

The Great One, though only two 
b odi es had gone into its cavern- 




THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE 



35 



mouth, was not crashing after more. 
It stood motionless beside the tree 
in which Taljuck had clung. Its ex- 
pressionless eyes looked toward the 
west, not toward extra victims. 

A thundering, bubbling air-rush 
came from its transfixed throat. Blood, 
and hairy fragments that it could not 
swallow, geysered from its maw. It 
lurched slowly away from the aerial 
village. 

For a long moment the hairy people 
watched it go, unable to understand. 
Then the first timid shout of deliver- 
ance keened out, to grow to a chatter- 
ing, grunting chorus. 

The Great One was being driven 
away! Taljuck’s stone-tipped stick 
had beaten it! 

Three days later the tribe feasted 
on the mound of flesh that lay off to- 
ward the west. Ordinarily no death 
of a man was remembered for three 
days, individually, in the dim minds 
of these folk. But they remembered 
Taljuck’s, because he had saved the 
tribe! They feasted in Taljuck’s 
name, and the men of the village 
fashioned long sticks to bend, like his, 
and send stone-tipped lances into the 
flesh of other animals. 

Taljuck the Quick was dead; but 
the tribe lived on, saved by the living 
fruit of his brain. 

^ ^ ^ ^ 

F rom their mountain observa- 
tories all over the world, the 
astronomers peered up the magnify- 
ing channels of their three-hundred, 
and three-hundred-and-fifty-inch tele- 
scopes. 

In the teeming cities around them, 
activities were stilled. Men, women 
and children stood hushed in the 
streets, and they stared as the 
astronomers did, up into the sky. For 
every man’s fearful eye, and every 
man's appalled thoughts, in the year 
2114, were on the same object. 

The moon! 

From that heavenly ball, hanging 
balloonlike now in the cloudless sky, 
it seemed that the death of the human 
race was coming. For the moon was 
dying; and in its extinction it 



promised to upheave Earth so that no 
tiny human mite — perhaps no life at 
all — would be left on its surface. 

The human race had thought itself 
in a position to live a tranquil and un- 
troubled existence on Earth forever. 
It had outlawed the horrible wars that 
had nearly decimated civilization sev- 
eral centuries ago. It had solved the 
food problem, producing sustenance 
for Earth billions with only a few 
hours of work a day for each indi- 
vidual. It had prolonged the span of 
life to an average of a hundred and 
ten years. 

Man was firmly enthroned, he had 
thought. And for a time this had 
been true. 

But now this cataclysmic menace 
from the heavens threatened the en- 
tire human race! 

In the Mount Everest observatory. 
Professor Talmadge turned from the 
eyepiece of the telescope which was 
so powerful that it would have re- 
vealed a man walking on the moon’s 
surface, had there been one there to 
walk. He stared at his assistant, 
Tohiki. 

“It’s the end,’’ he said. “The moon 
is falling toward Earth at a rapidly 
accelerating rate.’’ 

Tohiki nodded, dark, slanting eyes 
shining with sad intelligence, 

“Even if it fell no further,’’ he said, 
“it would be the eventual end.’’ 

Both were silent, thinking of the 
catastrophes that had begun at once 
with the moon’s inexplicable subsi- 
dence back toward the planet from 
which it had been torn a million mil- 
lion years ago. 

All over the world earthquakes of 
unbelievable violence had destroyed 
cities, drained great lakes, created 
new ones, changing Earth’s map at the 
incidental cost of millions of lives. 

All over the world, volcanic erup- 
tions had burst forth on a terrifying 
scale. Active volcanoes had belched 
more molten rock in a year than in 
all their recorded history before. 

Old volcanoes became alive again. 
New ones formed in the most unlikely 
places ; one, ten miles across its 
jagged new crater, spouted through 
ancient rock in the Alleghanies, 



36 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



obliterating all human life as far north 
as New York and as far south as 
Washington. 

But the worst of the disasters were 
the floods — ever increasing in height 
and severity. 

At each high tide, the water of the 
seven seas rolled to new heights, 
pulled by the increasing drag of the 
moon. Daily, tidal waves mounted 
with their roaring crests loftier than 
they had been the day before. 

O coastal cities of any nation 
w’ere in existence any longer, A 
few twisted metal stubs showed where 
tall buildings had been. A few weed- 
wracked lines of broken stone indi- 
cated streets — ^when they could be 
seen at all under low-tide depths. All 
human beings, save those millions who 
had been engulfed by the encroaching 
sea, had long since fled to the inland 
mountains. 

“And still the moon comes closer,” 
murmured the Japanese. 

“Still it comes closer,” nodded Tal- 
madge. “And it will continue to ap- 
proach. It will reach the point where 
the ocean tides rage over the whole 
face of the Earth, daily. They will 
submerge all land, even this great 
crest. Nothing but marine life will 
endure. In fact, even that may perish, 
for at this point the moon will prob- 
ably burst and surround Earth with a 
belt of a million tiny moons that will 
blanket us from the sun so that our 
planet freezes.” 

Tohiki’s intelligent eyes went to a 
small drawing hung on the observa- 
tory wall. 

“That may save us,” he said. 

Talmadge shrugged. 

“There is perhaps one chance in ten 
that a choice few of Earth’s people 
m.ay survive the coming disasters in 
the Talmadge Retreat. If anything 
can save us, that can.” 

The astronomer, who was that rare 
scholar, a man of general accomplish- 
ments in varied fields of science, 
walked to the drawing and studied it 
with proud yet fault-finding eyes. 

Read in scale, the drawing showed 
a cavern ten miles across, with a 
rounded roof a quarter of a mile high 



which was supported by rows of en- 
ormous metal pillars. The cavern was 
in the base of a mountain, indicated 
by dotted lines, The outline of the 
dotted lines was that of Everest it- 
self, showing that the depicted cavern 
must be under the feet of the two men. 

“Shall we call the elected few to- 
night?” said Tohiki. 

Talmadge bit his lips. His eyes, far- 
seeing and keen, narrowed. Then he 
nodded. 

“Yes. Tonight. We know what is to 
happen so shortly. There is no reason 
for delay. And Tohiki — only two 
thousand people, the best of every 
walk of life.” 

“I understand,” said Tohiki. Death 
was in his eyes, as it was in the eyes 
of Talmadge. But the coming cata- 
clysm was too great for anything but 
utter, desperate calmness. “Particular- 
ly, you want engineers that can handle 
the atom-disrupter.” 

“Yes. That, by all means,” replied 
Talmadge. 

Tohiki left the observation chamber. 
Talmadge went over in his mind, for 
the thousandth time, the one thing 
that made 'oarely possible the preser- 
vation of human life on Earth. 

The Talmadge Retreat? No, it v/as 
not that. Anyone can excavate a great 
cave at a mountain’s base. It is another 
matter to feed and clothe two thou- 
sand people in it, and give them air to 
breathe, over centuries of time. This, 
Talmadge hoped to do with his atom- 
disrupter. 

It was the last great invention of 
mankind; one which by its very sim- 
plicity had baffled science for cen- 
turies. 

All matter is similar in that it is 
made from the same building blocks. 
One substance is made different from 
another only in that its atoms have 
varying numbers of protons and elec- 
trons. It had been known for a long 
time that if atoms could be disin- 
tegrated to their component parts, 
and the parts rearranged, any desired 
element could be produced from the 
elemental debris. Furthermore, any 
substance could be contrived synthet- 
ically by controlled molecular ar- 
rangement. 




THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE 



Starkly, ferociously simple, this 
fact! And with stark, ferocious sim- 
plicity, Talmadge had solved the 
equation. 

He disrupted atoms with heat. 

But such heat! Three million de- 
grees Centigrade, produced for a few 
millionths of a second by electrical 
discharge through high - tension 
vacuum tubes! It could not be kept 
up longer for fear of burning out the 
apparatus; but those few millionths 
of a second were enough to strip 
atoms. 

HE re-addition of electrons to 
produce any given element? Ah, 
that had been more difficult. But Tal- 
madge had solved it in experiments 
no less sublime for being empirical: 
he had discovered that different de- 
grees of heat produced different ele- 
ments, and had the differences tabu- 
lated. Thus by a variation of a few 
hundred thousand degrees he could 
take stripped atoms and give you 
what you liked, from hydrogen to 
uranium. 

From then on it was a mere matter 
of synthesis to produce anything from 
the air you breathed to the food you 
ate — out of rock, metallic ores, or any- 
thing else at hand. There were slight 
variations between the synthetic and 
the real products, Talmadge’s oxygen, 
for example, had an atomic weight of 
16.0003 instead of 16.0001; but these 
differences had no practical results. 

Thus, with the so-called atom- 
disrupter, Talmadge proposed to keep 
two thousand human beings existing 
for indefinite centuries in a cave 
under the base of Everest — until such 
time as the planet returned to some- 
thing like normality after the moon’s 
disruption, once more allowing life 
on its surface. 

Talmadge sighed. He thought his 
mighty invention was perfected. If it 
was, the human race had a slight 
chance of survival. If it was not — 

Soberly he looked around the ob- 
servatory for the last time, absently 
patted the magnesium rim of the 
tremendous telescope reflector plate. 
Then he went out into the sparkling, 
cold air of Everest’s crest, and stepped 



onto the slow-speed strip of the end- 
less escalator which, in its high-speed 
outer edge, took him toward the 
mountain’s base at forty miles an 
hour. 

Within ten hours all were assem- 
bled in the great cavern in the bowels 
of the mountain. There were men and 
women of the highest standing in all 
branches of science. There were men 
and women picked because of eugenic, 
physical factors to keep up the body 
stamina of the race. There were a 
few old men, chosen for their exten- 
sive learning; but in the main it was 
a young crowd. Talmadge knew well 
how necessary for blind race survival 
was a sound physique. 

The cave, in which these people 
were to live, and their descendants 
after them, for unimaginable cen- 
turies, was ready. 

In the center, a domed building 
rose that was the heart of the place. 
Dov/n from that went a shaft halfway 
to the core of the Earth. Up this shaft 
came Earth’s internal and eternal 
beat, to be transmuted into plentiful 
power. 

Around the shafthead were the 
bank rows of atom-disrupters where 
all necessities of life were to be 
manufactured. Tinned food enough 
for thirty years was in stock, before 
the two thousand would have to 
begin existing on synthetic food 
pellets. 

The entrance into the cavern was 
a mile-long tunnel from outer air at 
the base of Everest. This had been 
blocked up against the future mighty 
tides by a solid seal of liquescent rock 
which hardened into a substance like 
gneiss. Through the center of the 
mile-long seal, however, had been left 
a one-inch hole. Dov/n this were 
lenses in sequence terminating in a 
fish-eye lens that spread vision. A 
simple peephole, arranged because 
the atmospheric disturbances caused 
by the moon’s approach made tele- 
vision impossible. 

Talmadge addressed the shivering 
throng in the cavern. 

“Comrades, Earth, as you know, is 
about to pass into an epoch more 
violent than any it has suffered since 




88 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



it cooled enough for life to begin. 
During this violence we and our 
descendants hope to exist in here, 
through flood and fire, through the 
moon’s bursting and blanketing of 
Earth, through the ensuing glacial 
period. Mankind’s nucleus may 
struggle up to a reborn world from 
this cave a thousand years from now, 
a million — perhaps never. But mean- 
while we shall keep the spark of the 
race alive, I hope.” 

That was all, and even that was 
superfluous. All knew why they were 
here, and what faced them. The calm 
of catastrophe beyond mortal imagina- 
tion to visualize held them. 

Talmadge turned to the peephole. 

It was all very bewildering and in- 
credible. There was no explanation 
for the suddenness with which it hap- 
pened. All scientists had agreed that 
the mounting tides w'ould rise gradu- 
ally, a little higher each day, until at 
last all Earth would be daily deluged. 
And all scientists were wrong. 

Talmadge, inventor of the atom- 
disrupter, turned to that peephole to 
see for one thunderous instant a thing 
which was impossible, but which was 
nevertheless occurring. 

Instead of increasing in height 
gradually, the moon-dragged tide had 
leaped within a few hours to within 
a half mile of what should be its 
eventual maximum! 

He had thought to see a dry vista 
from the mountain’s base ; had thought 
it would be weeks before the high 
plateau would feel its first ripples 
from the distant ocean. Instead, Tal- 
madge looked through the rock seal 
to see something that at first he 
thought was a great mountain chain 
newly formed, about a quarter of a 
mile from the fish-eye lens. 

Then he saw that the mountain 
chain was composed of water; was the 
first really great tidal wave. ^ 

A sort of moan left his lips. Mile 
high, in spite of the altitude to which 
it had already climbed to reach here, 
the wall of water rushed toward 
Everest. Talmadge’s stunned eye saw 
great crests toppling from its highest 
ridge, to be absorbed by the wall be- 
fore they could cascade downward, so 



great was that wall’s speed. He saw 
something like a tiny slug for an in- 
stant, near the crest, and realized it 
was a whale. 

He saw white specks on the ground, 
microscopic in comparison with the 
tidal wave, swallowed in a half second, 
and realized that the lofty buildings 
of the new city of Ebberhow, on 
Everest’s base, had been destroyed as 
all things pertaining to humanity 
must have been destroyed along the 
tidal wave’s path. 

A wave a mile high! Coming with 
incalculable speed and force! Tal- 
madge saw the solid wall rush seem- 
ingly upon his own defenseless per- 
son as it rushed for the far lens, then 
saw nothing at all, as the water struck 
the mountain’s base. 

“Comrades !” he cried, turning from 
the peephole. “The cataclysm is upon 
us. The first great wave has struck — ” 

His voice was lost in the trembling 
and rumbling of the mountain as all 
of mighty Everest quivered to the 
shock of that tremendous wall of 
water. But the people heard — and 
Tohiki, with a despairing scream, 
sprang to Talmadge’s side. 

He was not quick enough — 

T almadge ordinarily would 
have seen his danger as quickly 
as the agile-witted Tohiki. And God 
knows he knew enough of hydraulics 
to realize the incompressibility of 
water. But the magnitude of what he 
had seen stunned his brain — and 
Tohiki was not quick enough. 

At one instant Talmadge stood with 
the back of his head next to the peep- 
hole, and at the next instant Tal- 
madge’s head had disappeared. His 
body sank to the floor while over it, 
from the peephole, roared a one-inch 
stream of steam and water as straight 
and solid as a metal bar. 

The lenses, pushed before the water 
column like glass bullets, crashed to 
atoms against the opposite cavern wall 
ten miles away. The water column en- 
dured for five hundred yards before 
it feathered to nothingness. It grew 
in diameter to an inch and a half, two 
inches, three, before the wave outside 
passed on and left a glistening,

drenched world to rear bared rocks to 
the air again. 

Then the two thousand in Tal- 
madge’s Retreat, with their horrible 
panic allayed, went to the body of 
their leader. 

Talmadge’s head had been sheared 
off almost as though with a knife, as 
the lenses shrieked from the peephole. 
The flesh of his throat at the stub- 
end was pulped almost to the con- 
sistency of whipped cream by the high 
velocity of the projectiles. 

A concerted moan came from the 
throng in the cave; then shoulders 
were straightened with grim resolve 
and faces were turned resolutely 
toward one another. 

Outside was a drowned and lifeless 
world ; one that would be so battered 
and drowned daily for thousands of 
years. Inside, their leader, Talmadge, 
lay dead. 

But the protecting seal of his liques- 
cent rock, and the benificent products 
of his atom-disrupter, lived on after 
him. The human race had a chance at 
salvation because of the work of his 
clear mind. 

I N the late afternoon, Talgor the 
Tall huddled into the protection 
of his vacuum suit and stared through 
the transparency of his oxygen hel- 
met at the familiar landscape spread- 
ing from the vacuum-walled tower 
beneath him. 

He looked absently at a world as 
round and smooth as a gigantic 
billiard ball; a world covered by thin 
top-soil on which grew patiently 
nothing but lichenous moss; a world 
lit dimly by a dark-red sun. 

Time was, according to the ancient 
fables, when the sun had been virile 
and warm and bright. Men did not 
have to walk abroad in vacuum suits 
to keep from freezing in the ever- 
lasting cold. Many forms of vegeta- 
tion, and of animal life, flourished. 
There had been mountains and val- 
leys, lakes and rivers and oceans. 

Then, according to the dim legends, 
a great satellite whose name was lost 
in antiquity had fallen on Earth. It 
had raised tides that raged for un« 



counted centuries. The tides had 
smoothed down mountains and filled 
up depressions. The satellite had 
broken up, shielding Earth from the 
sun, and water had frozen into a solid 
and uniform shell over the world’s 
smooth face. 

The countless fragments whirling 
around Earth had gradually been 
pounded to dust by meteors, am^ had 
vanished, leaving the world again in 
the sun’s rays. But it was a dying sun, 
now, with little of its original heat. 

But before the Great Change legend 
had it that a handful of men and 
women had hidden from chaos in the 
bowels of Earth under a lofty moun- 
tain. They had literally eaten rock, 
tearing down the atoms of whatever 
material was around them and re- 
making them into life’s necessities. 
The handful had grown to hundreds 
of thousands, and the small cave into 
which they had originally gone had 
become a vast underground kingdom. 

Then they had emerged to the world 
as it now was — to find that they were 
not the sole form of life still existing! 
Another form had evolved across t’ne 
world from their mountain; a form so 
alien and foreign, so horrible — 

Talgor looked guiltily around, and 
then, hastily, pressed the little switch 
which shielded his thoughts from the 
Masters. Almost since the memory of 
present men there had been in the 
transparent oxygen helmets they were 
forced to wear in Earth’s thin atmos- 
phere the familiar transmitter send- 
ing thought vibrations to the head- 
piece receivers of the Masters. 

It was only a year ago that Talgor 
had devised the sensitizor screen 
which shielded his thoughts from the 
transmitter. Now he could keep his 
thoughts secret when they dwelt on 
Them, though he was aware that 
death would be his lot if They found 
it out. 

He went on with his bleak thoughts. 

During the chaos caused by the fall 
of Earth's now-forgotten satellite, 
man had survived in his cave. Across 
the world cold-blooded life which man 
had called fish had also survived. Most 
submarine life had been killed by the 
battering tidal waves, just as air- 



40 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



breathing creatures had been killed. 
But a few had found refuge in an 
underground ocean. 

O one could guess how many mil- 
lion years ago that had been. 
No one could theorize about the evolu- 
tionary course that gradually fol- 
lowed. All that could be said was that, 
when Man came forth from his under- 
ground empire, the descendants of 
these cold-blooded marine beings 
similarly emerged. 

They were still cold-blooded, able 
to freeze and thaw out again without 
harm. They still breathed oxygen 
from water: their transparent helrri^ts 
contained water instead of air. But 
they walked on four paddlelike legs, 
clothed their glistening and hairless 
bodies in vacuum suits, and in their 
never-blinking, lidless eyes shone in- 
telligence. Much intelligence! 

They were bigger than Man in brain 
as well as bulk. Men had stagnated 
underground. They had kept alive the 
atomic knov/ledge compiled by the 
nameless hero whose inventive genius 
had kept the race alive, but had added 
no new knowledge. The cold-blooded, 
water-breathing creatures had kept 
expanding in brain power. 

They became the Masters, with 
human beings as their slaves. 

Talgor smiled bitterly. Little enough 
use men were to the Masters ! They 
were far ahead of men in thinking 
capacity; their hardy physical points 
made them better fitted to survive in 
Earth’s present bleakness. Talgor had 
often thought that the Masters al- 
lowed mankind to exist only because 
of Man's hands. 

Marvelous things, hands! With 
them men and women, the slaves, 
could build machines more easily 
than could the Masters with their an- 
noying flippers. They could more 
easily manufacture the water the 
Masters needed for their breathing, 
for long ago all water lying normally 
on Earth’s surface had evaporated. 

But, regardless of the purpose, the 
Masters kept the race of mankind in 
a bondage none the less horrible for 
the fact that the great majority of 
human beings were not versed in the 



ancient legends and did not know the 
comparative servitude they were in. 

But Talgor knew! He knew that 
men had once ruled Earth. He knew 
that men should be superior to these 
cold and emotionless beings calling 
themselves Masters. 

And he plotted for the return of 
Man’s day! 

He stirred in his vacuum suit, and 
stared over the tower’s rim. Below, he 
saw several dozen small figures mov- 
ing. They were friends, secretly ap- 
pointed to meet him here. He went 
down the tower’s core to meet them. 

A score of figures moved to join 
him as he emerged at the tower’s base. 
They were white ; colorless in a way 
inconceivable to mankind of a far 
earlier day. Their hair was white, 
their skins were white, their eyes were 
white save for pale smudges of pupils. 
Absolutely without color. Talgor the 
Tall towered among them. He was 
nearly four feet in height, almost as 
big as the average Master. 

■'You have your thought screens 
switched on?” he said swiftly and 
without preamble. 

All nodded soberly. They were mov- 
ing on the edge of death, meeting 
here, conspiring against the Masters, 
and all knew it poignantly. 

“You are ready to risk your lives to 
the end that the world be cleared of 
the Masters, and that human beings 
are supreme again?” 

Their white heads inclined a second 
time. 

“You know to the full the bondage 
in which you are held?’’ 

“I know,” said one, voice sounding 
broken and hoarse through the dia- 
phragm in his helmet. “My woman was 
taken last year for thinking against 
the Masters. They took her helmet 
and vacuum suit from her and 
watched while she strangled and 
froze.” 

“I know,” said another. “A short 
time ago the Masters took my first 
child. I had allowed the third bank 
of atom-rearrangers, under my care, 
to slow for a needed repair and they 
sought to punish me. They threw 
her, a little girl, into the re- 
arrangers. I saw her disappear before 




THE INVINCIBLE MIDGE 



41 



my eyes. Then They turned the heat- 
control to 900,000 degrees, and a 
ragged blob of codium appeared 
where my first child had been.” 

T he others somberly added their 
tales of horror and oppression. 
The last concluded on a desperate 
note — one which Talgor, however, had 
sensed before. 

“The Masters are about to get rid 
of us, I believe,” this man said. “Time 
and again one or more of us has gone 
mad and revolted. Some of the Mas- 
ters have been killed. Some of their 
machinery has been smashed. They 
have had several councils in which 
men are called unstable and a possible 
menace. They are holding one now. I 
believe that is their last council!” 
Talgor the Tall nodded, v/ith des- 
perate calm. 

“ I believe you speak the truth. I 
believe the race of man is lost — unless 
a weapon I have been working on for 
nearly a year can save it.” 

“That is?” inquired the oldest 
among the rest. 

“You shall see.” 

Talgor led the way into the en- 
trance, through the thick vacuum 
wails of the tower. It was an ordinary 
supply tower, one of the smaller and 
more remote of the hundred towers 
which were the scattered heart of all 
life — in which were the latest and 
finest atomic machines. They were 
substantially the same as the one 
which had gone with the handful of 
human beings into the cavern far in 
the dim past when the Earth’s satel- 
lite fell and broke. 

The unknown hero of that time had 
come close to the ultimate with his 
atom-disrupter; it was possible to 
make few improvements. 

Power was still obtained by borings 
toward Earth’s core — borings that 
pierced to the very center, now. The 
nearest available substance was 
thrown into the disrupters, to emerge 
after varied heat treatments as the 
various substances of life, just as had 
been done in the cavern. 

Talgor the Tall led the v/ay to the 
boring in this particular tower. Beside 
the two-foot-thick nozzle of pure ar- 



drium, hardest of all known alloys, 
was a squat bell of transparent sub- 
stance within which could be seen 
numberless tubes, topped by a circular 
grid of some metal none of the men 
had ever seen before. 

“This is the weapon with which I 
hope to save mankind,” said Talgor, 
his eyes sternly proud as he stared at 
the bell. “Within this bell heat from 
the boring is converted to electrical 
energy, which is in turn transformed 
back to radiant heat and stepped up 
in wave length almost to infinity by 
the tubes. The radiant heat is capable 
of passing through atmosphere and 
other transparent substances, to ex- 
pend its energy on whatever opaque 
body stops it — up to a range of about 
ten miles. There its force is dis- 
sipated, diminished by the square of 
the distance traveled. But I think the 
range will be sufficient.” 

The others stared at him, awed, 
frightened, hopeful, 

“But the Masters’ vacuum suits,” 
objected one, at last. “They may be 
capable of insulating their bodies 
against even your radiant heat.” 
Talgor smiled bleakly, 

“Their bodies may be shielded to 
some extent, but not their heads. For 
they wear the transparent helmets 
just as we do, and my radiant heat 
will pass through transparencies as it 
does through atmosphere, diminished 
only by the square of the distance.” 
“You are sure — ” began one of the 
rest, timidly. 

“I am sure of nothing,” said Talgor. 
“I have had no time to experiment 
properly. The Masters moved too 
quickly for that. My weapon may kill 
them — it may not. That is the chance 
we take. Now you must go quickly. 
The Masters will be here soon.” 

“The Masters? Here?” 

“Yes. For the past few minutes I 
have had my thought screen switched 
off so that they could read my mind 
and learn of the plot against them 
here. I concealed only the manner of 
the weapon itself. Within a few mo- 
ments the Masters will be here — all 
of them save the very young and the 
infirm, darting to crush me before I 
can menace their race.”

THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



T he other men milled around the 
tower with frightened cries. For 
generations fear of the Masters had 
been inbred in them. The knowledge 
that, in a body, they were coming here 
now maddened them with fear. 

“Leave the tower at once,” Talgor’s 
calm voice cracked out. “Prepare to 
kill all survivors of the Masters’ race 
as soon as I have struck. Prepare to 
lead mankind back to freedom.” 

The men streamed all too willingly 
toward the entrance. But one said; 
“You, Talgor! What happens to 
you — ” 

“Leave the tower instantly, before 
it is too late!” Talgor interrupted, 
with a break in his voice. 

What would happen to him? He 
knev/ only too well what would be his 
fate — what must be the fate of any 
man within these walls when his 
radiant heat transmitter began to 
function. 

The others ran from the tower. 
From the soles of their metal boots 
appeared their gravity plates, shield- 
ing mass from Earth’s gravitational 
pull. They shot heavenward, soared on 
stub wings slithering from the arms 
of their vacuum suits, shot skyward 
again when altitude was lost in dis- 
tance, repeated the process, sky- 
hopping rapidly off to the east. And 
from the west — 

The face of Talgor the Tall paled 
under his helmet. 

The sky to the west seemed to be 
darkening with a great cloud. Only 
there had been no such thing as a 
cloud in the sky for a million years. 
This blackening was caused by the 
massed bodies of the Masters — every 
one capable of movement was rushing 
to Talgor’s tower because of the frag- 
mentary thought-threat he had per- 
mitted them to receive. A menace to 
their race! This one mad human 
midge must be crushed — then, more 
leisurely, the rest of the slave race 
that had lately grown annoying! 

Talgor watched from the entrance. 
The up and down advance of the 
Masters, like waves of a great black 
sea, rushed upon him. They towered 
up in a last ascent before swooping. 
He could see individual bodies now; 



monstrous cylindrical bodies witft 
four stubby limbs} heads with |taring, 
lidless eyes glaring out through 
water-filled helmets. 

He leaped to the control of his heat 
transmitter. His thin white fingers 
clutched it. 

One touch of that ardrium lever 
and, if his calculations were correct, 
the human race was saved! It was as 
tremendously, sublimely simple as 
that. But he himself — 

The thin air outside the tower 
whistled and shrieked with the cleav- 
ing of thousands of stubby wings. 
Talgor the Tall pulled at the con- 
trol — 

For weeks, along the equatorial belt 
where life was concentrated, human 
beings under the leadership of the 
score who had been last to talk with 
Talgor destroyed remaining vestiges 
of the monstrous race that had en- 
slaved Man for thousands of years. 
The old and the very young; those 
who had been too distant to get to 
Talgor’s tower with the main body; 
all the Masters Talgor had not anni- 
hilated. Then, with mankind once 
more enthroned on Earth, they 
erected a great statue to Talgor where 
the tower had once been. 

Had once been ! 

There was scant trace of the struc- 
ture now! 

When Talgor had pulled at the con- 
trol the vacuum walls had blazed 
and melted, allowing the radiant heat 
to smite full against the wheeling, 
towering horde of Masters. The heat 
had charred their heads, then ex- 
ploded their helmets as the water 
within was turned to steam. Only 
blackened fragments strewed the 
burned earth for miles around — all 
that was left of the last grave threat 
against humanity’s existence. 

Talgor? 

Well, there was no tower left, no 
trace of its banked machines. There 
was nothing left where the tower had 
stood save a distorted transparent bell 
within which was fused metal. 

Talgor had given his life, horribly, 
when he pulled that control. Talgor 
was dead. 

But the human race lived on.

FLIGHT OF THE 




CHAPTER I 
The Empty Stratocar 

^^GAINST a sky glorious with 
flung streamers of scarlet and 
purple, New York’s leaping 
towers and arching aerial streetways 
traced a prismatic arabesque epitomiz- 
ing the wonder and the beauty of the 
Twenty-first Century. But Don At- 
kins, his lithe, compact body poised 
on big-thewed legs widespread and 



firmly planted, was as oblivious to 
that far-off glory as to the bustle of 
the Federal Skyport all about him. 

He stood beneath the high loom of 
the landing trap, squinting into the 
west out of slitted eyes from whose 
corners weather wrinkles rayed 
threadlike, and he was conscious of 
only two things. 

Under the yellow silk of his air- 
man's tunic a small, hard lump was 
cold against his breast. It was the

talisman o£ the Silver Eagle, the 
throbbing pulse in his temples re- 
minded him, symbol of the gallant 
fellowship into whose fold he had 
been inducted at last. The secret 
that for months had lain prickling be- 
tween him and his one close friend, 
Bart Thomas, was a secret no longer. 
Bart himself, darting from the dis- 
tant Pacific, would be here in minutes 
now to receive from him the twisting 
handgrip of the order. In minutes — 



in seconds — now — 

A siren howled across the field. A 
black speck notched the low sun’s up- 
per rim. “On time to the dot!” At- 
kins exclaimed. A white blur in the 
air was suddenly a silver, tear-drop 
shape caught in the high-reaching fin- 
gers of the landing trap’s gaunt gird- 
ers, a thousand feet above him. The 
gigantic beam surged down, pivoting 
on its huge hinge, perilously fast at 
first, then more and more slowly as

its hydraulic shock-absorbers sapped 
the stratocar’s incredible momentum. 

Atkins dashed for the spot where 
the duraluminum-skinned, man-carry- 
ing projectile would ground to end 
Thomas’ half-hour flight from ’Frisco 
Skyport. 

A knot of brown-garbed mechanics 
clotted around the tiny car. Their 
wrenches clanged against the bolt- 
heads that had clamped tight the 
hatch cover against the airlessness of 
upper space. Twirling metal rasped 
against metal. The shining, oval door 
swung back. With eager impatience 
Atkins shoved past the mechanics, 
thrust head and shoulders into the 
aperture. 

“Happy landing, old sock,’’ he 
shouted. “Welcome to — ’’ 

The greeting froze on his Ups. The 
tiny cubicle was unoccupied; was 
starkly, staringly vacant. In the heat- 
less light of the ceiling tube the tele- 
view screen mirrored the Skyport tar- 
mac, glimmered from the glossy 
leather of the cushion on which 
Thomas should have lain outstretched. 
But Thomas wasn’t there — 

Atkins’ skin was a tight, prickling 
sheath for his body. The thing was 
grotesquely, weirdly impossible! Im- 
possible for his chum to have got out 
of the stratocar unless someone had 
unbolted the hatch from outside. Im- 
possible for it to have landed some- 
where so that that might have been 
done. To have arrived on the dot of 
its schedule the stratocar must never 
have relented from the utterm.ost limit 
of its speed. Time lost in any halt 
could not have been made up. 

Impossible for there to have been 
any halt; the device was propelled by 
the blast of an electrostatic catapult 
at its starting point and had no power 
of its own. Once stopped it could 
not have taken up its flight again. 
And it had come straight as an arrow 
to the landing-trap’s hooks at which 
’Frisco had aimed it. 

A fleck of white on the cushion 
caught Atkins’ eye. He reached in, 
snatched it up. It was a bit of paper, 
and on it^ — 

“Mr. Atkins,” a peremptory voice 
battered at his giddy brain, “Conceal 



that and bring it to me at once.” 

The airman thrust the scrap into 
his pocket, whirled. The groundmen 
were crowding in around him, their 
swart countenances curious, but it 
was evident that none of them had 
spoken. Then he recalled the tiny 
receiver clamped against the bone be- 
hind his ear, and he knew whence the 
summ.ons had come. 

“This device hasn’t been perfected 
yet,” the grey man in the hidden room 
had said, “but within t’ne limits of the 
field I can speak to you through it se- 
cretly and at will.” There had been a 
view-screen before him, too, whose 
cosmic-ray eye could scan anything 
within fifty miles. 

“Close it up,” Don Atkins snapped, 
“and say nothing to anybody.” Then 
he was running across the long, level 
tarmac, was dashing up the broad 
steps of Flight Headquarters Build- 
ing, was hurrying through the inter- 
minable maze of corridors within. 

The chaos within his skull took on 
a pattern as the amazing revelations 
of his initiation came back to him. 
The nation dreamed itself at peace 
with all the world. The Asafrican 
Alliance, Americans fatuously 
thought, having driven out the white 
races from the continents they had so 
long dominated, wanted nothing but 
to be left alone. 

T hey reckoned without the driv- 
ing ambition of Hung-Chen, the 
new Genghis Khan, who had forged 
an irresistible war machine behind the 
inscrutable mask of the East and 
awaited the auspicious m.oment to 
launch it against the Occident and the 
Americas. If he could not be 
stopped, war, rapine, slaughter, must 
inevitably destroy the Golden Age to 
which civilization had at last attained. 
But here was the wall-panel, in a 
guarded corridor, whose curious 
quality he had been taught less than 
an hour before. Atkins halted, glanced 
cautiously left and right. He was un- 
observed. He bent to get his lips close 
against a certain whorl in the blue 
tracings with which the marble was 
figured, whispered a password. A 
whirring sound, seeming to come 



FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE

from the very stone itself, told him 
that the impact of his voice had set in 
motion the sound-lock within. The 
apparently solid marble slid open and 
the airman went through. 

The wall thudded shut behind him. 
In the windowless room he entered 
a short, grave-faced man, mouse-like 
in grey silk, looked up from his desk. 

“Let me see what you found,” he 
said without preamble. 

Atkins fumbled in his pocket with 
shaking fingers, pushed the paper 
across the desk to the chief of the 
Silver Eagle. The red lines on it 
leered at him again, the ominous de- 
sign that had pronged him with knowl- 
edge of the catastrophe that had over- 
taken Thomas. A deftly drawn dragon 
was coiled around the orb of Earth, 
one taloned claw sprawling trium- 
phantly to obliterate the double tri- 
angles of the Americas. 

The chief’s grey face was almost 
expressionless as he touched the 
thing with a fingertip, but under his 
pale, inscrutable eyes little muscles 
twitched uncontrollably. 

“The token of Hung-Chen,” he said. 
“Like him to let us know that he’s 
defeated our last device against his 
spies.” 

“What does it mean?” Atkins 
groaned, mental agony m^aking him 
forget rank for the moment. “What 
does it mean?” 

The other’s tones were very calm 
— only the vaguest flatting betrayed 
the despair that must be closing in 
on him like a pall. 

“It means that the key to the gaps 
in the West Coast electro-barrage is 
in his hands, the only thing he needed 
to enable him to strike. Thomas was 
bringing the plan to Army Head- 
quarters, and he’s got Thomas.” 

“But — but you said that the Silver 
Eagle memorizes all its messages. You 
said that Hung-Chen’s spies had 
tapped every means of secret commu- 
nication we’ve had and that’s why the 
Sliver Eagle was organized — ” 

“Correct. We thought that a band 
of glorified couriers, shot across the 
continent at a speed greater than any 
yet known, would circumvent him. 
But we’ve failed. This lets us know 



that we have failed. They will get 
it out of Thomas — ” 

“No!” Atkins’ fist pounded down on 
the desk. “Bart will never tell. He’ll 
die before he tells.” 

“He won’t die until they know. 
They’ll strip his brain — ” The chief 
broke off. “But that may take time. 
If we can find him before — ” He 
ripped a long tape from a machine on 
his desk. A straig’nt purple line 
traced on it wavered at a single point. 
“Look here. This deflection in the 
flight-graph shows that an extra 
amount of power was being absorbed 
between three minutes, twelve seconds 
out of ’Frisco and seven minutes, 
forty-six seconds after the start. I 
noticed it and thought that the pro- 
jectile had svi'erved slightly from its 
course, was taking additional energy 
to straighten it out. But it occurs to 
me — ” 

“What, sir?” Atkins demanded, ex- 
citedly. “What?”' 

“That something may have come 
into the field, there betv/een three 
hundred and twenty and seven hun- 
dred and seventy miles from the Pa- 
cific, on the great circle course. We 
might look that region over.” 

“I’m going, sir!” 

Grey eyes stabbed keenly at the 
trembling airman. 

“You’re new, Atkins. I don’t 
know — ” 

“Bart Thomas is my friend. Chief. 
More than a brother—” 

“Very well,” the grey man made his 
decision. “You may go. And God 
help you if you are caught. Listen — ” 



CHAPTER II 
The Kappa-Ray 

A GREEN light from Traffic Con- 
Xm trol flashed the “all clear” signal 
and Atkins thrust his throttle home. 
His gyrocopter leaped straight up 
from the fields, shot up through the 
night past the successive glows of 
the level markers. The red of the 
lumbering freighter-lane, the yellow 
of the local-flight zone, the cerulean 
blue of the five-thousand-foot level in

THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



which the great transoceanic liners 
plied cometlike; they surged past in 
his view-screen, dropped below. 

Sunburst came to him from over 
the bulge of the rounding terrain as 
his ’ceptor staggered logily. Its roar- 
ing vanes could no longer find any 
support in the near vacuum of the 
stratosphere. Atkins twisted the con- 
trols. 

The lifting-vanes collapsed into 
their slotted grooves. The flyer was 
a sleek silver fish from whose tail the 
crimson flame of rocket gases fanned 
out. It darted westward, silent and 
swift as a bat out of hell. 

Atkins throttled down, reluctant 
but obedient to the chief’s instruc- 
tions. He must not overtake the sun; 
darkness would be his best aid. Two 
red spots burned bright on his cheeks 
and secret fires flickered in his glow- 
ing eyes. 

“I’m coming, old man,” he muttered 
between his teeth. “I’m coming, Bart. 
Stick to it. Don’t give in. Don’t tell 
them — ” 

Endlessly blurred Earth streaked 
Underneath him, endlessly the red po- 
sition dot drifted with nerve-shred- 
ding slowness across the map framed 
at the flyer’s elbow. He shut off the 
feed, unfolded once more the gyro- 
vanes. He drifted down through the 
darkness, silent as a cloud in a foggy 
night as invisible. A rugged moun- 
tainside, forest-cloaked, swam up into 
dim view. 

Atkins checked the descent, hov- 
ered. A twist of his wrist, and the 
beam of his kappa-ray projector was 
searching the serried carpet of the 
trees. To the unaided eye that beam 
was utterly imperceptible, but on the 
specially treated screen at w’nich the 
airman peered avidly a flickering disc 
cut through imaged foliage, through 
dark underbrush. To the kappa-ray 
all organic matter is transparent; 
only earth, stone, or metal can reflect 
it and become visible. 

Minutes dragged. Bare ground, 
only bare ground, netted by branch- 
ing streamlets. Then — what was 
that? 

Atkins held the ray steady, quiver- 
ing with bowstring tenseness. An 



irregular cube of stone showed misti- 
ly. A house! A human habitation 
in the wilderness! His heart bumped 
crazily against his ribs. But — wait a 
minute — it might be a Ranger station, 
a depot of the men who patrolled this 
primeval forest that was preserved as 
a national park. Beyond the house a 
metal something, huge, curiously 
formed, bulked vaguely. 

Atkins’ pulse leaped. He had found 
that which he sought. Thomas’ cap- 
tors thought themselves well hidden 
beneath the leafy screen. Evidently 
the kappa-ray was one secret that had 
been successfully kept from them. 

Lov/er still Don Atkins dropped, 
until he was a bare hundred feet above 
the treetops. Too bad his search beam 
could not reveal human forms. He 
dared not send the map coordinates 
of this place by radio. He would be 
overheard, the gang would be warned 
and escape. But at full power it 
would take him seven minutes to 
reach ’Frisco Skyport. Then a hun- 
dred pursuit rockets would leap into 
the air. In minutes the mountain 
could be surrounded by well-armed 
men. He reached for the throttle. 

The sea of foliage, almost black in 
the long evening shadows, glowed 
suddenly into green flame. Just above 
the strange building an orange pin- 
point leaped into existence. An in- 
verted cone of radiance soared light- 
ning-swift from that focal point. In- 
stantly the ’copter was bathed in the 
flare. Intolerable heat struck at At- 
kins. The steel walls about him flamed 
cherry-red. He was frying in the tor- 
rid blast. 

Already his senses were leaving 
him — with despairing instinct he 
thrust at the release lever of the 
emergency hatch beneath his seat — no 
time to snatch at the parachute cone. 
He was falling, falling — 

TKINS lifted slowly back to con- 
sciousness. His body was seared 
with pain. An iron band constricted 
his chest and his blood was salty warm 
on his lips. A black silence enveloped 
him, broken by vague rustlings 
and the sound of trickling water. 
His dazed eyes adjusted themselves 




FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE 



49 



to the dimness, and he saw twisted 
tree branches, moonlight sifting 
through leaves all about him. He was 
lying across a sturdy, gnarled bough. 
Above him he could make out broken 
branches, a funneled path torn 
through thick interlacing foliage. 

Slowly it dawned on him what oc- 
curred. Plunging down, he had struck 
the lofty crown of some forest giant. 
The smaller branches, the massed ver- 
dure at the top of the tree, had ab- 
sorbed the force of his fall. This 
larger branch had caught and held 
him, had kept him from crashing 
through to the ground. 

He had failed miserably. The reali- 
zation wrenched a groan from him. 
Suddenly he tensed, clinging tightly 
to his bough, listening acutely. A 
voice sounded. Heavy bodies threshed 
through the underbrush. A yellow 
glow flickered among the trees below, 
and was gone. It came again, held 
steady as it grew brighter. Two bulk- 
ing shadows appeared, forcing 
through the thick growth. The dim 
back-throw of a lantern beat against 
the dull green of a Ranger’s uniform, 
familiar to Atkins from hunting and 
fishing expeditions in these very 
woods. 

This was luck! Their post could 
not be far off, with its radio-phone. 
He’d chance a coded message to the 
chief. His throat tightened to a cau- 
tious call — 

The lantern-bearer stumbled, ripped 
out an oath. It was not in English! 
His light found his face. High cheek- 
bones, thick lips, narrow, slanted eyes. 
They were Orientals! They were 
searching for something! 

Of course — it was he for whom they 
were looking — his body. They want- 
ed to make sure of his death, make 
sure that his crumpled form, lying 
perhaps near a trail, would not betray 
their hiding place. 

The lantern glow flashed dartingly 
along the ground, into the treetops. 
Atkins tried to make himself a part 
of the limb. Rough bark rasped a 
deep wound in his palm. He flinched 
uncontrollably, lost his grip. He was 
slipping, was falling ... A desperate 
tightening of his gripping knees, a 



flexing of his aching arm muscles, 
stopped the disastrous fall. But the 
leaves still rustled with his move- 
ments. 

A sharp challenge ripped the forest 
silence. A tube in the yellow hand 
of one of the searchers spurted blue 
flame. It shot through the leaves and 
its heat, the acrid smoke of seared 
greenery, stung Atkins’ nostrils. A 
second bolt came still nearer. Even if 
they missed him the light of those 
ray-tube flashes must reveal him to 
the hunters. 

“Cut it out, Mingai,” the other Asi- 
atic’s voice rasped in English. “It’s 
nothing but a wildcat, or some othei 
animal.” 

“I do not think so. I do not like 
that we have not found the body of 
the flyer.” 

“Forget it. He was burned up in 
the ray.” 

“The orange ray does not slay. It 
merely accelerates the electronic vi- 
bration of metallic atoms until the 
melting point is reached. But I for- 
get, you would not understand. You 
are as stupid about scientific matters 
as the Americans among whom you 
have been raised. You even speak 
their barbarous tongue better than 
the language of your ancestors.” 

“You give me a pain. Come on, 
let’s get back. We’ll tell Fu-Kong to 
do his own dirty work.” 

^f'MTERY brave, you are, when he 
W cannot hear you,” Mingai 
sneered. “But in his presence you 
cringe and are meek like the rest of 
us. No, friend Li-San, we do not re- 
turn as yet.” 

“All right, if you’re going to be that 
way. Let’s look further.” 

“Not till I discover what there is In 
this tree.” Hope died in Atkins’ 
brain. 

“Going to keep on raying till we’re 
spotted by some snooping Ranger?” 

“No, there is a better way.” Min- 
gai turned back to the tree. His cyl- 
inder again jetted its blue flame. It 
was continuous now — was boring 
across the trunk. Back and forth the 
steady yellow hand drew the disinte- 
grating beam. The great bole quiv- 



50 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



ered, started to sway. Atkins got his 
feet beneath him on the perch, leaped 
down. 

His aim was true. His heavy boots 
struck square on Mingai’s shoulder. 
He felt bone crack beneath the im- 
pact of his weight. Even as the man 
dropped the American jumped side- 
ward, catlike, his lithe form twisting 
in mid-air so that he faced the other 
Oriental. He caught a fleeting glimpse 
of a startled countenance — then the 
saffron face was obliterated by the 
crashing thud of his fist. He whirled 
away, hurtled into the shadowed 
brush. 

Thorned tendrils caught and tore 
at Atkins. A root tripped him, and 
he crashed headlong into a tree trunk. 
He thudded to the ground — lay there 
— his tortured lungs laboring — his 
outstretched hands plucking at the 
earthy loam. 

From behind, Atkins heard a thin 
whistle, shrill almost above the range 
of human hearing. From far to his 
right another, responding. Evidently 
the men from whom he had escaped 
were signalling for aid. He struggled 
erect. He was unarmed, alone, bruised 
and battered, terribly fatigued. But 
he knew now that he could escape by 
working down the hill, to his left. In 
the other direction were desperate 
men, weapons at their ruthless com- 
mand that could whiff him into eter- 
nity at will. He turned to the right. 



CHAPTER III 
TJie Pursuit Squadron 



P ON ATKINS crouched in the 
shelter of a bush. Before him 
the stone structure he had seen from 
the air loomed blackly. Over the 
clearing a rope network carried a 
camouflage of tree branches that his 
kappa-ray had pierced. He could hear 
a murmur of voices, but the sounds 
came from beyond or within the squat 
building. 

On the side toward him there was 
silence, and nothing moved. The 
darkness of the wall he faced was re- 
lieved by a horizontal line, a thread 
of light, almost imperceptible. The 



American’s eyes clung to it. Then he 
was crawling across the bare ground 
that lay between. Twenty feet of 
shelterless surface, flecked with the 
revealing light of the moon. Could 
he make it, unobserved? 

Inch by crawling inch, every muscle, 
every nerve, taut with expectation of 
a sudden hail, of a blue flash that 
would sear him into nothingness, At- 
kins slid toward the beckoning line 
of light. After an eternity, he was in 
the solid shadow of the wall. He 
raised himself cautiously and found 
the place where the light shone 
through. It was the lower edge of a 
steel-shuttered window, just at the 
level of his eyes. 

He could not see much of the room 
within, the aperture w’as a mere slit. 
But what he saw was enough! Just 
within range of his vision was a table- 
top, black, and glistening like glass. 
Fastened to its surface, leather straps 
cutting deep into the flesh of his arms 
and legs, was Thomas! His friend’s 
stocky body was stark naked. In a 
cold lurid light that beat down, At- 
kins could see his knotted muscles 
writhe snakelike, the sweat of agony 
gleaming on his skin. 

Thomas’ face was deathly white, his 
clenched teeth were revealed by lips 
that curved away, his eyes were closed 
and his cheek muscles were quivering. 
His forehead, his hair, were covered 
by a metal helmet, from which wires 
curled away out of sight. 

A low, mechanical hum rose steadi- 
ly in pitch. Bart Thomas’ form arched 
slowly up from the table, straining 
against its creaking bonds. Suddenly 
the hum stopped, and the twisted 
body slumped flaccidly, inertly, down. 
A yellow hand, slim, its long fingers 
ending in pointed nails, came into 
view, holding a small sponge to 
Thomas’ nostrils. The prisoner quiv- 
ered, his eyes opened, and Atkins* 
fists clenched as he read the despair 
that stared from them. 

He heard a voice, suavely cruel. 

“It is very painful, this searching of 
your brain. If you chose to talk you 
would save yourself much anguish.” 

Atkins’ scalp was a tight cap for his 
skull as the bound man’s eyelids 



FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE

dropped, and lifted again. Even, 
speech seemed too great an effort for 
him, but his lips moved. A hand was 
clamped over Atkins’ mouth, a power- 
ful arm wound around him from be- 
hind, pinning his own arms to his 
sides. He was lifted from the ground. 
He drove a desperate heel backward 
into a hard shin. Something crashed 
against the back of his head and he 
hung, dazed and barely conscious, in 
huge arms that carried his hundred 
and fifty pounds as though he were a 
child. 

The room whirled dizzily about Don 
Atkins. He saw men, a television 
screen, a black tube that rose through 
the ceiling from some unknown de- 
vice. He was carried through another 
door and a saffron-hued face, length- 
ened by a wisp of grey beard and 
drooping mustachios under a hawk 
nose, drifted hazily before him. Only 
the eyes were clear; black eyes, pierc- 
ing behind their slanted lids. 

Atkins was set down in a chair. 
Hands fumbled at him, passed a rope 
around him, binding him to his seat. 
He scarcely noted it, spellbound by 
those glittering eyes. His fogged 
brain cleared a bit and he saw a tall 
Oriental, imperturbable. There were 
banked tubes glowing behind him, 
and bright copper coils. To one side, 
a table, its black top glistening like 
glass. Thomas, strapped down, was 
looking at him with eyes in which in- 
credulity and horror flared. 

The tall Oriental spoke. 

“Who is this, Na-Garri?” 

F rom behind Don a huge black 
came in view. Dressed, like the 
others of the gang, in the olive-green 
of the Rangers, he was still redolent 
of the jungle. His skin was a deep, 
dull black that swallowed light. His 
bullet head sat queerly on wide shoul- 
ders from which arms thick as sap- 
lings hung loosely almost to his knee.s. 
His voice was a throaty rumble. 

“I don’t know. Lord Fu-Kong. But 
the electric-eye alarm he flash, and 
I find this one peeking in. So I bring 
him to you. Maybe he the one who 
we bring down from the plane, the one 
who jump on Mingai and Li-San.” 



The other nodded. 

“Probably. He seems very persis- 
tent.’’ To Atkins: “You display a 
great deal of interest in our proceed- 
ings. I hope you are satisfied with 
your present opportunity to observe 
them.” 

He reached out a clawlike hand and 
ripped away the front of the airman’s 
shirt. He snatched at the token hang- 
ing there. The fine gold chain 
snapped, and he had it in his hand. 
A faint smile crossed the jaundiced 
mask of his face and he held the tiny 
bird out to the black. Not a half inch 
long it was, but exquisitely wrought. 
An eagle, poised as if in flight, it 
seemed almost alive. 

“See, Na-Garri, this is another of 
the brood. They wear talismen about 
their necks, like your own tribesmen, 
to bring them good luck. But I fear 
the Dragon of Hung-Chen is too 
strong for their puny godlet.” He 
turned back to the American. “I shall 
deal with you in a moment, when I 
have finished v/ith your comrade. 
Watch closely, American, and I wish 
you joy of what you see.” 

Now he was talking to Thomas, and 
his voice was a crawling threat. 

“Have you decided to answer my 
questions?” 

“No!” Thomas’ voice was a tor- 
tured whisper, but his lips closed 
tight and firm. Fear and despair drew 
haggard lines across his face. 

Fu-Kong shrugged, stepped to 
the wall where a tall slate panel glit- 
tered with switch-points, gages, 
gleaming ebony wheels. 

“Still stubborn. You will not be- 
lieve me, then, that this searcher will 
delve deeper and deeper into the core 
of your brain till it wrenches the ut- 
termost secrets of your ego from you. 
Yet it was an American who first 
proved that thought is an electric 
process, who first measured the tiny 
currents that flow along the nerves. 
Well, if you must have it — ” His fin- 
gers closed on a lever just above bind- 
ing posts to which the wires trailing 
from the helmet on Thomas’ head 
trailed. “Now—” 

“Fu-Kong. Fu-Kong,” a shrill cry 
from the outer rooiti stopped him. 



52 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



“Another plane has appeared above.” 
Atkins forced his head around. Min- 
gai was in the doorway, his shoulder 
bandaged, his right arm in a sling. 

“Well, why burst in on me like 
this?” Fu-Kong was imperturbable. 
“Send someone to dispose of the re- 
mains.” 

The other’s face was a sickly green. 
“But it got away,” he gasped. 

“It got away?” The phrase was 
like the purr of an enraged cat. 

“Yes. My broken arm — I had to 
use my left — I missed with the orange 
ray, and before I could aim again he 
was out of range.” Mingai’s voice 
trailed away in an apologetic murmur. 

“You — ” the other began, fury 
breaking through the stony mask of 
his face. But again there was an in- 
terruption. A sallow Hindu appeared. 

“Master, the plane that escaped is 
signalling to ’Frisco Skyport, and 
their rocket squadron is taking off.” 

The chief had not failed them! He 
had sent a following plane that by 
great good luck had escaped the Asi- 
atics’ lethal ray. Atkins calculated 
hastily. In ten minutes now this nest 
would be surrounded, the spies cap- 
tured, Thomas freed and his secret 
safe. 

UT Fn-Kong was snapping per- 
emptory orders. Mingai and 
the Hindu had disappeared, Na-Garri 
was unstrapping Thomas, was carry- 
ing him out. The Oriental leader him- 
self, ray-tube in hand, was unfasten- 
ing the rope that bound Atkins. 

“Get up and precede me.” The spy 
gestured with his weapon. The 
American obeyed, staggering on limbs 
that were needling with returning 
blood. He was through the outer 
room, his captor close behind him; 
was in the open. Straight . ahead 
loomed a monstrous metal shape. Egg- 
shaped it was, save for one end that 
was sliced off sharply, and there was 
an opening, man-high, in its side. Na- 
Garri was just vanishing within, with 
his burden. Atkins followed. Fu- 
Kong clanged shut the slide behind 
him. 

A steel ladder mounted through a 
dim green light, curving over an in- 



ner shell. Atkins’ head came through 
a trapdoor above, and he was in a low, 
long chamber. Then he was once 
more tightly bound. A rough shove 
from the black sent him sliding across 
the floor to thud against Thomas’ 
trussed and naked form. 

Li-San was just closing the trap- 
door. Mingai, fear in his eyes, was 
thrusting up on a valve-handle that 
projected from a large vertical pipe in 
the wall. At the far end, before a 
large view-screen, the Hindu was 
seated, black discs of phone receivers 
clamped to his ears. Beside him Fu- 
Kong bent over a serried row of gages 
and levers atop a metal console. A 
large view-screen before him showed 
the forest-bordered clearing and the 
stone building that had been vacated 
in such haste. 

Fu-Kong pushed at a lever, and the 
view-screen was a flare of flame. It 
cleared. Where the house had been 
was a gaping hole in the ground. T1 ^ 
Oriental’s hand moved again. The 
screen was a down-rushing blur. It 
cleared once more. Velvet-black, star- 
strewn, the night sky was about them, 
and the far-below forest was a dark, 
mysterious sea. 

“Don, old man,” the whispering 
voice in his ear was Thomas’, “how on 
earth did you ever get into this 
mess?” 

“I came to find you,” Atkins said 
grimly. “And I did. How are you?” 

“Pretty rocky. But I’ll keep until 
Fu-Kong gets a chance to work on me 
again.” 

“I can’t understand how he ever got 
hold of you. Your carrier came in 
right to the dot. What happened?” 

“I was zipping along, watching the 
U. S. shoot past in the screen, when 
suddenly something flashed over me 
and dropped down in front.” 

“Shot over you! I thought the 
rocket-stratocars were the fastest 
things ever produced.” 

“So did I, until I saw this craft. 
I’ll bet it can make three hundred 
miles a minute. It passed me as if I 
were standing still. At any rate, 
there it was, right ahead of me, and 
slowing. The blunt end was toward 
me, and I thought sure I was going 




FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE 



53 



to crash into it. No way to swerve 
those carriers, you know. But just as 
I reached it, a hole opened and I 
sailed right inside.” 

“Good Lord! Then it’s a — ” 

“A sort of flying trap. Damned in- 
genious, eh? I can figure out the rest 
of it now. You say the stratocar 
reached New York on time? That 
means they closed the stern and 
speeded up again till they were mak- 
ing just the rate I was. Afterward 
they went faster once more, got clear 
of my boat and dropped away. They 
had just picked me out of it on the 

fly. 

?? M LL I knew at the time was that 
my hatch opened, and the big 
black was pointing a ray-gun at me. 
He told me to get out, and I got. VVe 
were in an air-lock, and there was a 
rope ladder hanging down. I climbed 
it and found myself in this room. Fu- 
Kong was here, and the Hindu. Then 
in a little while we were down in the 
clearing, where the others were wait- 
ing. After that my troubles really 
began — Look at the screen!” be 
said sharply. 

Atkins twisted himself back to his 
original position. In the distance a 
score of scarlet lights made a dancing 
crescent on the view-screen. They 
rose and fell, but came on steadily. 
He thrilled at the sight. These were 
the army flyers from ’Frisco Skyport. 
No mistaking that formation. 

Those far-spreading wings would 
sweep around as the center checked, 
and the Asafrican craft would be 
caught in an enfilading fire. Fu-Kong 
and his gang were doomed! Peculiar 
how calmly they were taking it. East- 
ern fatalism, he supposed. 

Eastern fatalism, hell! Memory 
fanged him! Thomas had just told of 
the incredible speed at Fu-Kong’s 
command. The spy master was not 
trapped, far from it. He could get 
away at will. Why was he hanging 
here motionless, watching those on- 
coming flyers, a sardonic smile ting- 
ing his yellow face? 

Nearer and nearer the lights came. 
The dim shapes of the army rocket- 
planes showed, phantomlike. The cen- 



tral ship dipped, minutely, and the 
long line began to expand. The mot- 
ley crew of the spy ship clustered be- 
hind their leader in the bow. 

“Near enough.” Fu-Kong’s voice 
rang like a sentence of doom. A long 
pencil of orange light shot out from 
his vessel, wavered, impinged on the 
nearest plane. The flyer flared red, 
then dazzling white, at the tip of the 
beam. Then — there was nothing there. 
The death ray moved on to the next 
in line. 

All along that far-flung line a cor- 
uscation of green swept, as the in- 
domitable fighters shot out their fu- 
tile answer. Lethal enough, those 
rays, but their range was far short. 
Another plane was caught in the 
orange beam and vanished ! Another! 
But the squadron came on, their mile- 
long fire-tails lashing them through 
the night. 

If one, only one, could get near 
enough to spear the Asafrican craft 
with its beam! Taking that one des- 
perate chance the birdmen rushed into 
the face of destruction, never falter- 
ing, never wavering, as ship by ship 
the orange scythe reaped its deadl3^ 
harvest. Only ten ships were left of 
the score that had first appeared, only 
nine — and still the green rays were 
miles short of their mark. 

Minutes passed that were long as 
eternity. Eight of the intrepid at- 
tackers remained, then seven. But 
now the stabbing darts of emerald 
death were almost reaching their 
mark. A little more — only a little 
more. Suddenly the floor vibrated and 
Atkins heard the muted thunder of 
the craft’s rocket blasts. The spy ship 
was moving at last. 

Fu-Kong would escape — that v/as 
unavoidable. The terrific speed of his 
strange vessel could never be matched 
by the combination plane-and-rocket- 
craft of the Americans. But at least 
the pitiful handful remaining would 
escape the holocaust. Seeing the fu- 
tility of their courageous attempt they 
would return to their base, perhaps 
eifectuate plans for a countrywide en- 
circling movement that might in the 
long run bring the yellow ship dov/n. 
No — Atkins’ mouth twisted in a 



54 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



Boundless oath — the Oriental had no 
intention of permitting that. 

The distance between the spy-craft 
and the nearest attacker did not in- 
crease. The Asiatic was keeping just 
beyond the range of the green rays — 
was taking toll on the American avia- 
tors with false hope while the merci- 
less orange beam flared out, mowing 
the velvet night with destruction. 



CHAPTER IV 
The Dragon of Hung-Cben 

UT of the twenty flyers who had 
soared to the attack a bare SiX 
still charged on. They were insane! 
They .couldn’t win — 

But couldn’t they? Atkins stifled 
a gasp, was taut with sudden hope. 
Five of the squadron’s remnant had 
startlingly changed their tactics. 
They were zigzagging, were darting 
left and right, up and down, in what 
seemed a last panicky attempt to 
evade the Asiatic’s ray. 

Senseless, it seemed — but there was 
one ship that had left the group. Its 
green ray was doused, only the pin- 
point red of its tail-flame betrayed its 
course to Atkins. He flung out his 
soul in a wordless prayer that neither 
Fu-Kong nor his aides would notice 
that stealthy climb. 

Steadily the squadron leader mount- 
ed till the scarlet dot that marked him 
out was touching the upper margin of 
the view-screen. Ten thousand feet 
below, his comrades flitted about in 
their macabre dance, cheating the 
orange death again and again by 
breathless inches. The attention of 
the enemy crew was concentrated on 
those darting shapes, on their darting, 
ineffective rays. 

Atkins’ eyes flicked back to the lone 
flyer. He saw the sudden crimson 
burst, saw the dovmward curve of its 
flaring wake as a terrific swoop began, 
saw the green ray dart out ahead, 
spearhead of the diving hawk. Down 
and down and down, adding the pull 
of Earth to his own driving blasts, the 
avenger plunged in one last, magnifi- 
cent effort to catch the destroyer un- 



aware; zipping faster and faster until 
even in that tenuous air the steel 
plane-body glowed dull red with the 
friction of its unleashed speed. 

A minute’s grace — sixty unobserved 
seconds of that lightning slant — and 
it would snip the yellow menace from 
the skies. 

“Look — Fu-Kong — look!” It was 

Mingai who yelped the alarm. The 
orange ray swept up. Jammed, By 
luck — by the luck with which the 
gods award the greatly daring — the 
down-darting American had found 
the one vulnerable angle of the spy 
ship. Green flame licked out hungri- 
ly, but Fu-Kong’s hand was light- 
quick in its flash to the throttle lever. 
His ship lurched — jerked aside in the 
last possible moment of safety. 

The American was under, now, 
right under the spy-craft. But the 
dragon ship was driving ahead. In 
an eye-blink Fu-Kong would be able 
to bring his death ray to bear on the 
daring flyer ! Don Atkins flung heavi- 
ly across the floor by the sudden jerk, 
saw, not quite three feet above him, a 
gleaming copper handle — the valve at 
which Mingai had twisted just before 
the take-off. 

Legs lashed, arms bound, sweat 
pouring from his lined brow, eyes 
’bulging from their sockets, by sheer 
power of stomach and trunk muscles 
alone he swung his torso from the 
floor. His head came level with that 
handle. His teeth clamped around it. 
Corded sinews stood out on his neck 
as he drove the valve lever down. Sud- 
denly he was snatched loose by a lurch 
of the craft, and his preposterously 
twisted body crashed down. 

But that very lurch told him of suc- 
cess! It was the main fuel-valve! He 
had cut off the rocket-tube’s supply! 
In an instant, now, the vessel would 
be caught in the ray-beam of the pi- 
lot below. Atkins tensed to meet the 
green flash that would mean oblivion 
for Fu-Kong and his myrmidons — and 
for Bart Thomas and himself. 

It never came! A shrill, high- 
pitched oath, footsteps running to- 
ward him, pulled open his eyes. Fu- 
Kong was bending over him, face livid 
with wrath, ray-gun rising for the 




FLIGHT OF THE SILVER EAGLE

eoup de grace. Behind him Li-San 
came up, a strange glow between his 
slant lids. Atkins’ eyes flicked past 
the couple. In this final moment o£ 
life he must know what had happened, 
why his intended sacrifice had failed. 

A BLUE electric veil, shimmering 
and sparking in a cerulean net- 
work of tiny lightnings, curved ail 
across the view-screen. Beyond it the 
misty shapes of the attacking aircraft 
spat their green beams. The emerald 
death rays spattered harmlessly on 
the ionic curtain, and were quenched. 
From within, the orange ray thrust 
futilely against the hollow, defensive 
sphere of force. 

This Atkins saw in a single, flash- 
ing glance. Then he was staring up 
at the enraged Oriental, was waiting 
in a timeless void for the blue spurt 
that would sear thought and con- 
sciousness and life itself from his de- 
spairing brain. 

“Wait, Master!’’ Li-San snatched 
at Fu-Kong’s hand, swerved it aside 
from its aim. “Wait! That way is 
too easy for the pale-skinned dog. Let 
me and Mingai take care of him. V/e 
have a debt to pay for v/hat he did to 
us in the wood!’’ 

In the other’s slitted eyes a glint 
of satisfaction showed. 

“I had my doubts of you, Li-San. 
Twice you have shown deplorable 
softness in your tasks. This I like 
much better. You may have your 
wish. But take him below — I have 
much to do and do not wish to be dis- 
turbed.’’ 

Atkins’ skin crawled. Death he 
could face calmly — but that which the 
fanatic gleam in Li-San’s saffron mask 
promised made him a coward. 

“Fu-Kong,” he croaked, barely able 
to force the words through his con- 
stricted throat. “Don’t give me to 
him! Kill me yourself. That would 
be clean and honest.” But the Ori- 
ental was walking away. 

They took him down through the 
trapdoor, carried him down, flung him 
heavily on the plates in the narrow 
space between the entrance hatch and 
the curving inner shell. 

“Untie him, Mingai.” There was an 



undercurrent of eager excitement in 
Li-San’s tones. Even in the face of 
what was to come, Atkins wondered 
at the gratuitous cruelty of the Ori- 
ental mind. Mingai stooped to him, 
fumbled at his lashings. As they fell 
away, the American leaped up to make 
a fight of it. Hopeless, of course, Li- 
San had his ray-gun poised for action. 
Better to go out that way than to suf- 
fer the planned revenge of the sadis- 
tic duo. Now — 




“Hands up, Mingai! Quick!” The 
virulent threat in Li-San’s voice made 
the low command seem a crashing 
shout. Mingai straightened. His 
arms flew above a saffron face from 
which amazement and horror had 
stripped its habitual mask. Li-San 
was braced on spread feet, his ray-gun 
thrust before him. His countenance 
was alight with a strange flame, and 
his eyes snapped menace. “One 
whimper from you and I flash!” 

There was an instant of stunned 
silence. Then Li-San spoke again. 

“Here, you Am.erican! Grab those 
ropes. Tie him up and gag him. 
Quick, man!” 

Dazed by the sudden turn, Atkins 
obeyed. VVhat lay behind this sudden 
act on the Asiatic’s part? Had he suf- 
fered a sudden change of heart — He 
recalled, in the wood, Li-San trying 
to argue Mingai out of his determina- 
tion to search the tree in which he was 
hiding. He recalled Li-San’s inter- 




56 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



vention with Fu-Kong a moment ago 
that had certainly saved his life — 
His task was finished — Mingai 
tightly bound, and a strip from his 
own tunic jammed none too gently 
into his mouth. Before Atkins could 
’^oice his questions there was a sud- 
den dull roar which shook the vessel. 

“He’s getting under way again,’’ Li- 
San barked. “We’ve no time to lose.” 
He plucked Mingai’s ray-gun from 
his belt, thrust it into the American’s 
hand. “Come on!” He was flitting 
silently up the ladder, Atkins, per- 
force, after him. 

T hey were just beneath the rivet- 
studded trap. Li-San lifted the 
lid, slowly, till a narrow crack of 
brighter light showed along its edge. 
Atkins managed to crush in alongside 
of him on the narrow step, and to- 
gether they peered through the slit. 

The blue defensive sphere was gone 
and the attacking ships had vanished. 
But something else showed in the 
sky; a long, slim, torpedolike object 
that sped straight for the spy ship. 
From its nose a white light flickered 
in a rapid series of dots and dashes. 
Atkins felt an electric quiver of tense- 
ness run through the yellow man 
against whose body his own was 
crushed. 

A strange pattern formed itself in 
the American’s mind as he crouched 
there, waiting for he know not what. 
That oncoming shape had the very 
form of the rocket-stratocars used by 
the Silver Eagle. Yet this was no 
messenger, waylaid as Thomas had 
been. He had signalled to Fu-Kong. 
Why had the spy-craft waited here, 
chancing the fight with the American 
planes, when it might have been away 
and gone with only the slightest ef- 
fort? What was it that glowed from 
Li-San’s eyes, that shook him with an 
ague of eagerness? 

Nearer came the speeding rocket, 
and nearer still, until it passed out of 
sight at the lower edge of the view- 
screen. The larger craft lurched, and 
lurched again. Fu-Kong thrust at his 
levers, there was a hiss of rushing air. 
Then a buzzer shrilled. 

“He’s picking up the stratocar,” Li- 



San whispered. “Get ready.” 

“All right, Na-Garri,” Fu-Kong 
called. “The air in the entrance lock 
is at normal pressure. Open up.” 

The black bent to a ring in the cen- 
ter of the floor, and pulled on it. A 
round manhole lid came away. A 
head appeared, and a squat, broad 
body followed it. 

Straight black hair, tiny black eyes 
almost hidden by high cheekbones, 
broad flat nose over thick, red lips — 
this was a Tatar face, a throwback to 
the Mongol hordes that in the Thir- 
teenth Century ruled half the then- 
known world by force of arms. From 
that stocky figure emanated an aura 
of power, of dominance. Unbounded 
ambition, lust for power, savage 
cruelty, were stamped on the round, 
flaccid countenance. 

Li-San clutched Atkins’ arm, his 
fingers sinking into the flesh. 

“It’s Hung-Chen! Come himself 
to receive Fu-Kong’s reports. To- 
morrow the attack.” Atkins under- 
stood why the spymaster had been un- 
able to flee. He had had to wait here 
for his chief — no way to change the 
course of the stratocar once it had 
started. 

The huge black bowed low. The 
Hindu joined him in humble obeis- 
ance. The haughty Fu-Kong came 
away from his controls, abject ser- 
vility in every line of his tall body. 
The Mongol spoke sharply, and there 
was a rapid exchange in a shrill, high- 
piping tongue. 

“Now!” The snapped word from Li- 
San galvanized Atkins into action. 
He thrust upon the hatch, le.aped. 
Clang! The yellow men swung to the 
sound of the falling trapdoor, saw 
tv/o apparitions spring into view, ray- 
guns at the ready. 

“Throw up your hands! Up vi^ith 
them!” Atkins’ shout drove through 
the chamber. “Up, or we wipe you 
out!” Li-San’s eyes were blazing pits 
of wrath. Na-Garri’s simian arms went 
ceilingward, the Hindu’s. Hung- 
Chen’s. Fu-Kong ripped out a viru- 
lent, “Traitor !” at Li-San and 
snatched at the cylinder in his belt. 

“S-s-s-s-s!” Blue lightning hissed 
from Atkins’ weapon. A blackened

corpse crumpled slowly to the floor, 
“Any more?” His voice was thick 
with fury. But the remaining three 
stood statuelike. “We surrender,” 
came the voice of the captured over- 
lord. “Don’t flash.” 

T heir captives tightly bound, the 
two — Don Atkins, the American, 
and Li-San, the Chinese, turned to one 
another. Atkins’ hand went out to 
the other, then hesitated — drew back. 
Li-San straightened. 

“No,” he answered the question in 
the American’s eyes, “1 am not a trai- 
tor to my own people. Here,” his 
hand tapped his own breast, “there are 
two loyalties — one to the race among 
whom I was born, among whom I have 
lived my life and have my friends, the 
other to the race of my ancestors. 
War between them v/as unthinkable 
to me.” He glanced down at Hung- 



Chen, bound and glowering, looked 
up again, a wdstful smile hovering on 
his saffron face. “Now there will be 
no war. I’m sorry I couldn’t save the 
squadron of planes. I had to wait 
until he arrived, you see. And it was 
too dangerous before to attempt to 
capture the ship.” 

“You joined their rotten gang, 
risked death and worse, to defeat 
their plans — to save your own people, 
and mine, from the horrors of v/ar!” 
Atkins exclaimed. “By God, Li-San, 
you are a man!” 

Yellow hand and white met and 
clasped. 

“Hey, you fellows,” came Bart 
Thomas’ weak voice from the floor. 
“When you get time you might take 
three or four of these ropes off me 
and get me something to wear. You’ll 
get all the handshaking you want 
when we get back to New York.”

SHALL WE EAT IN 2037? 

T here wUl be five bilUon people 
in the world by 2037, according 
to scientific estimates recently com- 
piled, if the present rate of increase 
keeps up. This is in spite of wars, 




disasters and epidemics. There are 
only thirteen billion acres of soil on 
the surface of this planet that will 
grow food. One person consumes the 
produce of about two and one-half 
acres, so five billion is about the limit. 

Will we have to go to another 
planet in order to eat? Or will sci-

HOW THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT 
WAS DETERMINED 

L ight travels approximately 
186,300 miles a second — and 
here’s how Professor A. Michelson 
first proved it. A beam of light was 
reflected from one of the sides of a 
revolving, twelve-sided block, each 
side of which was a mirror itself. This 
made successive flashes of light. 
These rays were sent a long distance, 
about a mile, and were reflected back 
again from a mirror. 



The distance the twelve-sided, or 
faceted mirror moved in the time it 
took the flash to go to the other mir- 
ror and return was the basis for figur- 
ing the speed of light. 

BACTERIA WITHIN METEOR 

T here is proof of the possibility 
of life upon other planets! Pro- 
fessor Charles L. Lipman, of the Uni- 
versity of California, claims to have 
recently discovered living micro- 
scopic organisms in meteorites which 
have flashed across the ether to Earth, 
from other planets. The interior of 
the meteorite, the professor explained, 
remained cool while the outside burst 
into flaming fragments. 

BLUE EYES ARE NOT BLUE! 

E yes that are grey, brown, or 
black are so colored because the 
iris contains a pigment of that tint. 
In the case of blue eyes, however, the 
outer layer of the iris is colorless and 
transparent. The inner layer is ex- 
posed. This is white, and reflects and 
scatters the light which strikes it. 
The blue rays of light, being the 
shortest, are scattered most readily. 
In consequence the iris, which is real- 
ly white, appears blue. The blueness 
of eyes is similar to that of the sky, 
the latter also being caused by the 
scattering of blue light, by the upper 
atmosphere. 

CRATERS OF THE MOON

Cyclopean bubbles bursting on the 
moon’s once viscid surface, later so- 
lidifying into crater rings? Bombard- 
ment by colossal meteoric missies 
from the sky aeons ago when Earth 
was rocked by volcanic tumults of her 
early geologic birth? A violent in- 
ternal explosion, like our own vol- 
canic eruptions? These are the three 
most popular theories. The real cause 
man will never know. 

A MATHEMATICAL MISTAKE 
ALTERED THE SCIENCE 
OF ELECTRICITY 

A LARGE group of eminent scien- 
tists and engineers once made 
an error in mathematics which altered 
the whole science of electricity! In 




1893 a congress of engineers and phy- 
sicists from all over the world con- 
vened for the purpose of establishing 
definitely and permanently the sizes 
of the various electrical units (ohm, 
farad, etc.) for there was much con- 
fusion in this matter. 

It was finally decided to make the 
abampere (the absolute or physicists’ 
unit of current) exactly equivalent to 
the ampere (the practical or engi- 
neers’ unit of current). On this ba- 
sis the relative magnitudes of the 
other electrical units in each of the 
two systems (absolute and practical) 
were to be determined. 

Throug’n some undetected error in 
arithmetic, the abampere was made 
equal to one-tenth of an ampere and 
not equal to a whole ampere asthe con- 
gress had decided. As a result of this 
error the relative values of all the 
electrical systems in the two systems 
are different from v/hat the congress 
set out to make them. Whereas the 
scientists wished to make an abcou- 



lomb equal a coulomb, the latter is in- 
stead ten times the former. And so 
on and on. This error, which was 
never corrected, thus altered the en- 
tire science of electricity. 

A STRANGE NUMBER 

T he number 108 seems to have 
some special significance in our 
Solar System. The diameter of the 
sun is 108 times that of the earth. The 
distance from our planet to the sun 
is 108 times the latter’s diameter. And 
the distance from Earth to the moon 
is 108 times the diameter of Luna! 

'CURVED" LIGHT 

S cience can now bend light. Pre- 
viously, except for the great 
space-curvatures v/hich Relativists 
say surround stars and suns, no con- 
ceivable agency or material could 
actually cause light to travel in a 
curve. This feat was accompished by 
Dr. Harry Robert Dittmar, of the Du 
Pont Research Laboratories with the 
aid of “Pontalite,” a new plastic 
known chemically as methyl methac- 
rylate polymer. Du Pont scientists 
recently demonstrated that a pretzel- 
shaped length of Pontalite could con- 
duct light, carry it around bends as a 
cable carries electricity. A flashlight 



was held close to one end of the twist- 
ed plastic tube. The other end of the 
tube shone brightly. 

The reason why Pontalite bends 
light is because of the crystalline 
structure of the material, which re- 
fracts the light in a series of very 
straight lines joined at slight angles, 
like bar links in a watch chain, so that 
the light stays inside the conductor 
until it reaches the end.

STOKES 

T he hard, irregular shape of the 
self-adjusting Nibbler moved 
over the grassland like a gigan- 
tic mechanical cow, only it had cater- 
piller traction bands instead of legs. 
Its thirty-two jaws, working alter- 
nately in echelons of eight, opened , . • 
shut . . . nipped . . . tore . . . rhythmi- 
cally. Professor Obinson had well 
remembered the importance of achiev- 
ing conditions as identical as possi- 
ble with those produced by the teeth 
and jaw action of herbivorous ani- 
mals before the fodder went into the 
Metabolisers. 

Farmer Geary watched the Nibbler 
at work. He saw beyond it the vast 
three-storied acreages of his Multi- 
ple-Crop “Flats,” incongruously tilt- 
ed on the side of Durdleberry Slopes 
in the distance. The bizarre shadow 
of the combined Wind-Suncatcher, 
like a spray of tulips mounted fan- 
wise on a rotating mast, slanted across 
the meadow. 

“This is good,” said Geary, rubbing 
his hands. “This is fine.” 

He had been reading through his 
accountant’s estimate of balance, and 
saw every prospect of being nearly 
ten per cent up on the previous half 
year. His Soya by-products, his fi- 
brous residues and his Metaboliser

fodder all showed a most healthy in- 
crease. Indeed, the only slight set- 
back had been in the third-tier Chlo- 
rophyl crops from the Flats, and this 
had been due solely to a mechanic’s 
unaccountable error in setting the 
thermostats. Well — he would settle 
this mechanic. Mason it was. He had 
already appealed to the Commission, 
claiming for the loss to be made good. 
This would probably reduce Mason’s 
superannuation prospects to those of 
the Third Class unless he made good 
in the next year or two by earning 
Maxima Efficiency Bonuses. 

So Farmer Geary had every reason 
to feel pleased with himself as he re- 
turned to the gleaming steel-and-glass 
farmhouse. 

He found the Portrals there, and 
old Faddley and his wife, and young 
Tim, on vacation from the University 
of Agriculture. They had been talk- 
ing about old times and new, as people 
will in all ages. 

“The greatest blessing of all” — 
Mrs. Portral was saying, as Farmer 
Geary stepped in from the lawn — 
“well, it’s hard to say. I remember 
when I was a girl, my mother used to 
tell me about how she used to mix 
foods together and put them into pots 
and ovens instead of just heating the 
carton. She said that it was a full 
day’s work doing all that unnecessary 
mixing and cooking, and cleaning 
plates and dishes afterward. Fancy 
having to use plates and dishes over 
and over again!” 

“Couldn’t have been really hy- 
gienic,” agreed Tim. “But then the 
twenty-first century was never much 
in advance of the tenth in the busi- 
ness of feeding.” 

“I think that the greatest blessing 
has been the abolition of edible ani- 
mals,” said Farmer Geary, adjusting 
a recliner and settling himself at the 
most comfortable angles. “Imagine 
the horrible animal smells and the 
dirt; the sweating skins and sali- 

“Don’t be coarse, Elbert,” Mrs. 
vating mouths; the flies.” 

Geary said. 

“Well, I’ve been to outlandish coun- 
tries where they still have such aw- 
ful habits, haven’t I? It nearly made 



me sick to see the way they depended 
on vegetation being transmuted 
through the filthy stomachs of ani- 
mals, for meat and milk. Blessings? 
I’ll give my unhesitating vote to syn- 
thetic Metabolising Plant every time.” 
“Harold here remembers cows and 
sheep in this country,” said Mrs. Fad- 
dley. “Don’t you, Harold?” — and 
Geary shuddered. 

“Sure. When I was a boy near a 
hundred and thirty year ago, I 
worked on one of the last of the old 
farms,” agreed old Faddley. “But I 
was used to it, you see, and I loved 
the smells of the farmyard and the 
lowing of the cows, and the simple 
Nature in it all. That’s why I’m in 
the egg-layers’ side of the business 
today. To handle live birds an’ to 
take interest in ’em reminds me of 
old times, you see.” 

“They even used to eat chickens as 
meat in those days, didn’t they, Mr. 
Faddley?” This was from Tim. 

“O’ course they did, Tim. But they 
wasn’t the featherless birds we uses 
today, you see. They had plump flesh 
and lots of feathers — fair bunches of 
’em like you can see at the zoo. And 
they used to run about the yard an’ 
scratch in the ground, an’ peck an’ 
cluck, an’ squat in the dust like any- 
thing. ’Twas music to me — ” 

ffMJEOPLE killed them,” Mrs. 

Portral interrupted hastily. 
“Then they plucked all the nasty, in- 
sanitary feathers off, and then they 
actually burnt them in ovens, lubri- 
cating them with animal fat and pig’s 
meat while they burnt. I remember 
my mother telling me.” 

“Talk about cannibalism !” said 
Portral. 

“The chief business of life today,” 
said Geary. “The whole business, I 
say, consists of, and should consist of, 
nothing but the efficient production 
and distribution of foodstuffs and 
manufactures and the vigilant observ- 
ance of hygiene and sanitation.” 
“Control, of course, sir — educa- 
tion — ” Tim suggested bashfully. 

“We can leave that to those respon- 
sible.” Tim quailed before Geary’s 
truculent eye. “I said the chief busi-

ness of life, my boy.” 

Old Faddley, in the arc of the wall 
near the humidor switch, wished that 
some other topic of conversation had 
been chosen. The very mention of 
old-style farms brought with it a 
strange nostalgia. While he had been 
speaking of the smells and sounds of 
his boyhood days on the land, they 
came back to him with such vividness 
that he thereafter drifted into a day 
dream. He fancied himself standing 
by a gate watching the cows coming 
through from the churned-up pathway. 
There were no sounds of mechanism 
or whirr of wheels; not even the dis- 
tant chug-chug of Wind-Suncatcher. 
The air was calm — warm with peace- 
fulness — as the cows came sedately 
through, whisking their tails; one 
after the other pausing for an instant 
to swing their heads sideward and 
favor Faddley with meaningless 
stares. 

And the field in which they grazed ! 
The surface was delightfully uneven; 
there were tufts and tussocks of grass 
— not the soulless smoothness of mod- 
ern meadows ready for great, lumber- 
ing, clattering Nibblers to work on. 
How well he remembered! In the far 
corner, near v/here the cabbages start- 
ed, were the hay ricks, and v/hat a 
pleasing aroma came from them, es- 
pecially when the sun came smiling 
after a shower! Pigs and fowls and 
big farm horses — and ducks. 

He never tired of watching the fam- 
ily of ducks, waddling comically after 
the mother to the dear, dirty pond be- 
hind the stables. Dear, oh, dear! 
’Twas well over a century ago. 
There’s no smell like the farmyard 
mixture, he thought, and there’s no 
animal like a cow. 

Nevertheless, on emerging from his 
reverie, he felt that he had been be- 
trayed by his unguarded enthusiasm, 
into a social indiscretion. He noticed 
a difference in Geary’s manner at 
once. 

Mrs. Portral, also, had looked at 
him with an expression of distaste. 
There was that sort of aloofness evi- 
dent in the room which might have 
followed the utterance of a blas- 
phemy. 



From that moment Faddley ceased 
to visit the Gearys. He shrank into 
his shell. Beyond an occasional busi- 
ness trip by air to Canada or to Ber- 
muda, he seldom stirred from his egg 
farm. He even refused his usual at- 
tendance as a delegate at the Egg 
Union week-end meeting in Rio de 
Janeiro. 

“Sad about the old man,” was the 
general verdict. “Getting into the 
sere and yellow at last. Never was 
truly with the times, you know. Of 
course he has to be up-to-date with 
production methods because of the 
Law — but at heart he’s a reactionary.” 

People shook their heads and went 
about their business leaving old Fad- 
dley to his egg hatcheries. Such a 
progressive age, with so many diver- 
sions to occupy what used to be 
known as “leisure,” could easily for- 
get a man w'ho properly belonged to 
the past. 

But Faddley was destined to 
emerge from obscurity at last, and to 
dart across the s’uy of the world’s 
news like a meteor of sensational di- 
mensions. There was scarcely a civi- 
lized home in the five continents in 
which the “Faddley Case” was not a 
topic of conversation, from the mo- 
ment of its first flashing on their visi- 
screens — one of the biggest news- 
scoops in the history of the Nord- 
Eurbpe-America Transmission! 

F ARMER GEARY had authentic 
first-hand information of the 
event. He retailed his intelligence 
with gusto to the visitors who had 
dropped like locusts on his tarmac oi 
hearing that he had something to say 
Thus Geary shared in the sensation 
to his great satisfaction. In his fa- 
vorite attitude on the recliner, he thus 
held forth: 

“I can tell you all about it — the 
most amazing thing that’s happened 
in America for many a long year.” 
He had a great opinion of himself as 
a raconteur, and meant to make the 
most of his opportunity now. “This 
fellow Faddley is perhaps the oldest 
man in the egg business today. He’s 
old in point of years, too. Well — 
most of you know him, I believe. 



DOWN ON THE FARM

jHere is an instance where the crook- 
edness of age warps a man’s mind and 
sends him into a groove of madness. 
I suppose he had felt himself gradu- 
ally being left behind by the younger 
generation, you know — snubbed 
would be the word — and it preyed on 
him. Anyhow, it turns out that for 
some months before the tragedy he 
had indulged in a sort of ritualistic 
retirement — meditation and so on — in 
one of his big egg flats that he kept 
for emergencies. Imagine a man of 
his age locking himself in that enor- 
mous building, surrounded by tier 
upon tier of empty incubators, laying 
boxes and all the paraphernalia of his 
trade! A solitary little figure in that 
great loneliness, tired of the world, or 
disgusted with it — I don’t know 
which. He’d stay there all day, so 
Mrs. Faddley said, and most of the 
night; only going indoors to his home 
toward dawn. Nothing she could say 
would shake the old fool. If she want- 
ed him to meet company he would 
growl out that he had no time for it. 
The man must have been day-dream- 
Jng, for he had known the whole place 
inside out for years, and that the Re- 
serve Flat had always been empty and 
had never heard so much as a single 



cluck from a layer. Anyhow, as the 
inner door swung open, there came to 
the ears of the inspector a dreadful 
sound, like a soul in torment; echo- 
ing in the back recesses of the Flat — 
and then old Faddley came running 
out with a face as white as death.” 

“What time yesterday did the ar- 
rest take place?” asked a young air- 
man. “I was up at the time and had 
no visi-screen on the dash.” 

“Seven o’clock on Tuesday eve- 
ning,” replied Geary. “About four 
hours after — ” He was interrupted 
by the flashing of the visi-screen that 
occupied the greater part of the wall 
to his left. 

“By Jove,” he said, “here’s the end 
of the tale.” 

For the visi-screen flashed;

He admitted his guilt on all counts — to

WANDERER of 
the VOID 

By DR. ARCH CARR 

Author of “The Discus Men of Ekta,” “Warriors of Eternity,’’ etc. 



A PALL of intense sadness lay 
like a blanket upon the 
grounds and the dull-gleaming 
mansion of Walter Brundage, owner 
of the small dark star, Merthel. For 
Janice Garth, Brundage’s beloved 
young granddaughter, had for many 
hours lain ill with some strange 
malady. 



Miriam Garth, mother of the strick- 
en child, stood before the screen in 
the visigraph room, impatiently wait- 
ing for the operator to adjust his ap- 
paratus to the broadcast beam. Then, 
at a signal from the technician, she 
swept up the portable speech trans- 
mitter. 

“Brundage City, on Merthel, calls 



64 







WANDERER OF THE VOID 



65 



ing the Wanderer. Calling the Wan- 
derer. Emergency call. Brundage 
City calling the Wanderer. . . 

The young woman spoke into the 
microphone until her throat became 
dry, her voice husky. But there was 
no answer to her call. The visigraph 
screen was blank. Had she been too 
late? 

If only Daniel, her husband, were 
here with her now, how much easier 
it would be to bear. She longed for 
the comfort of his arms, his soft 
words of encouragement, his love. 
Daniel Garth, who had been enmeshed 
in a web of circumstantial evidence 
built up by lawless conspirators’, 
Daniel, who had been convicted and 
sentenced for life in the Plutonian 
penal institution for a crime which 
he had never committed. . . . 

Suddenly the glittering surface of 
the visigraph screen reddened. Words 
in a flat, metallic voice crackled from 
the reproducer. 

“The Wanderer stands by for visual 
connection with Brundage City, Mer- 
thel.” 

The visigraph cleared and there ap- 
peared before Miriam Garth the image 
of the universal man of mystery — the 
Wanderer. A weird picture, there on 
the screen, the picture of a man clad 
in a grotesque black steel space suit 
of a type not generally accepted by 
rocketmen. 

No person, knowingly, had ever 
gazed upon the features of the Wan- 
derer. There were no transparent 
windows in his helmet, and he had 
never removed his space shell in the 
presence of others. Neither had his 
natural voice ever been known to reg- 
ister upon human ears. 

Two retinascopic photo-electric 
cells, set in the face of his helmet, 
surmounted the slitted orifice of a 
speech reproducer. On either side of 
the iron head was a sensitive, cylin- 
dric microphone. A small oxy-gene- 
rator of peculiar design was affixed 
to' the armor of his shoulders. Thus 
the Wanderer v/as able to breathe, see, 
hear and speak without his identity 
becoming known. 

“Miriam Garth, daughter of V/alter 
Brundage, calls the Wanderer,” Mir- 



iam spoke nervously into the trans- 
mitter. “My daughter has been 
brought down by a strange form of 
lethargic encephalitis, which our Mer- 
thelian physicians do not understand. 
Daniel Garth, the child’s father, who 
is a prisoner on Pluto, is affected sim- 
ilarly. But Dr. Vacor, the prison sur- 
geon, has been able to keep him alive 
for three years. I feel that if Dr. Va- 
cor could see my child there might be 
a chance to save her life.” 

Breathless, Miriam paused, then 
went on: “But we have no space ship 
in which to carry her to Pluto. Bors 
Lanoth, the pirate, attacked our city 
and destroyed the only ship on the 
planet. If you are near Merthel, will 
— won’t you take her?” 

The Wanderer’s electro-mechanical 
countenance showed no sign of hu- 
man emotion as he replied: 

“Prepare the child for the flight. I 
shall land upon Merthel shortly.” 
The distant sun, pale and anemic, 
plunged beneath the jagged western 
horizon as the Wanderer’s trim little 
ship, with braking rockets bellowing 
a mighty challenge to the bleak Mer- 
thelian landscape, dropped gently 
upon the ground near the Brundage 
mansion. 

A side port in the ship hissed, 
spun open — and the Wanderer 
stood there on the ground, waiting, 
his electric eyes casting twin shafts 
of dull, smoky-red light into the 
shadows. 

Miriam Garth and her father, both 
clad in heavy, electrically heated fur 
garments, approached the ship. Wal- 
ter Brundage bore the unconscious 
form of his granddaughter in his 
arms. The Wanderer motioned them 
toward the open port. 

He waved aside their thanks, board- 
ed the ship behind his passengers, 
closed and sealed the port. He made 
them comfortable and placed the 
child on a spring-suspended litter, 
fastened her securely to guard against 
the strain of acceleration. Then he 
went to the controls of his one-man 
ship. 

He turned to Miriam and her father, 
said: “Ascension!” 



66 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



“Ready,” replied Brundage'. 

The Wanderer glanced at the indi- 
cators before him, moved a lever. The 
ship rose rapidly on an even keel, her 
underjets roaring in crescendo. 

“Acceleration!” 

Again Brundage spoke their readi- 
ness. 

With a blast of stern rockets, the 
ship shot outward in a long arc to- 
ward the disc of Pluto, The Wander- 
er, his body braced against the sup- 
port rails, gradually adjusted the 
gravitation plates as Merthel’s pull 
lessened. 

After the fierce thrust of accelera- 
tion had subsided, Miriam let her 
eyes linger upon the motionless figure 
of the pilot. Who was this strange 
man in black steel armor, this weird 
avenger of crime who was ever ready 
to assist someone in acute distress? 

Laymen on every planet had ad- 
vanced the theory that the Wanderer 
was a senseless, cosmic ray automa- 
ton remotely controlled by some hu- 
man intelligence. But scientists con- 
tended otherwise. The Wanderer 
had displayed certain reflexes to un- 
foreseen contingencies, they claimed, 
that denoted perfect coordination of 
mind and body. • This could not have 
occurred, the men of science stoutly 
declared, in the case of a mechanical 
robot. 

The Wanderer had first come into 
interplanetary prominence by swoop- 
ing to the aid of a group of embattled 
space patrolmen on the inner satellite 
of Mars and assisting them in the ex- 
termination of a band of pirates. 

Thereafter, wandering ceaselessly 
through the black night of space, the 
Wanderer had waged an almost 
single-handed warfare against piracy 
until but one outlaw leader now re- 
mained alive — Bors Lanoth. 

The Wanderer’s deeds had made of 
him a legendary figure of romance 
and mystery, had earned him the title, 
Wanderer of the Void. And the fact 
that he was a masked unknown lent 
glamour to his exploits. 

He had agreed to reveal his iden- 
tity only when Bors Lanoth, last of 
the space pirates, no longer roamed 
the skies. 



Thus Miriam sat in meditation fo? 
many long minutes, her mind review- 
ing the Wanderer’s colorful history, 
her thoughts returning at last to her 
personal troubles. 

There was Daniel, her husband, a 
convicted felon, who for three years 
had lain in a deathlike sleep in the 
Plutonian prison. And now Janice 
was affected in a like manner. What 
was the nature of this unknown physi- 
cal condition t’nat had seized them? 

Tears started afresh to Miriam's 
eyes. She turned toward the observa- 
tion port beside her, gazed out in an 
abstracted manner. Then she sat up- 
right in her chair. 

Many miles out across the black- 
ness of space she saw the unmistak- 
able orange-red flame from the stern 
jets of a space ship, the yellow dots 
that were portholes in the side of the 
vessel. She announced her discovery 
to the Wanderer. 

“Yes,” he said, “I know. That ship 
has been pacing us for more than an 
hour. It is Bors Lanoth’s flagship, 
manned by his followers from the 
reptile planet. I knov/ it by the set 
of its rockets. For a long time I have 
sought an encounter with Lanoth, a 
fight to the finish. He would never 
give me that opportunity. But now, 
while I am on a mission of this sort, 
he brings the fight to me.’’ 

F ear tore at Miriam’s heart with 
icy fingers. The young woman’s 
nerves, burning like red-hot wires, 
were at the breaking point under the 
severe mental burden that had been 
imposed upon her. 

She slumped listlessly back into her 
seat, suddenly deciding to place her 
faith blindly in the iron-clad creature 
at the pilot controls before her. 

“Deceleration,” the Wanderer an- 
nounced. 

Brundage hastily affixed elasti; bar- 
nesses about Miriam and himael: The 
child required no attention. ;:n;e she 
was suspended on all sides. 

Vibration of the stern ’.s 

ceased. Then, abruptly. il_r.anr fe'.t

Miriam stared out at Lanoth’s ship, 
which had now ranged much closer. 
The craft had cut propulsion rockets 
and was braking fiercely, nosing 
downward for a landing on Pluto. 

Wind shrieked about the hull of 
the Wanderer’s vessel as it hurtled 
into Pluto’s frigid atmosphere. The 
Wanderer regulated the gravitation 
reactor accordingly. They soon 
dropped to a jarless landing upon an 
ice-incrusted plain near the penal in- 
stitute. 

The Wanderer brought out space 
helmets and oxy-generators from a 
locker in the ship’s nose. 

“As you know, Pluto’s atmosphere 
at night is but slightly above abso- 
lute zero,’’ he said. “You will need 
these to protect your lungs against 
the extreme cold. There is a small 
one to accommodate the child. All 
are fitted with short-distance cosmic 
ray transmitting and receiving appa- 
ratus.” 

The Wanderer placed a helmet 
about the head of each of his passen- 
gers, started the oxy-generators, saw 
that the communicating devices were 
functioning properly. 

The Wanderer’s voice boomed in 
Miriam’s ears. 

“I require no space gear for my- 
self,” he said, as if in answer to the 
question she had been about to voice. 
“My helmet is sufficient.” 

The girl looked at him — and won- 
dered. 

“There will be fighting, perhaps, 
and you will need a weapon.” The 
Wanderer looked at Brundage and in- 
dicated a rack of guns on the far wall. 

Brundage selected a side arm and 
a long gun, provided himself with am- 
munition. The Wanderer inspected 
the brace of Wauxum high-pressure 
pistols that hung in clip holsters at 
his own waist. 

Miriam and Brundage donned their 
fur garments, and the young woman 
took the child in her arms. They 
then followed the iron man into the 
air-lock and paused at the quartz win- 
dow in the exit port. Lanoth’s ship 
was just settling down some hundred 
or more yards away, the flame from 
|ier under jets blasting out a wide 



berth in the ice plain. 

“It would be best for you to remain 
on the ship,” the Wanderer told 
Miriam. 

He opened the lock and he and 
Brundage stepped down upon the ice. 
Miriam closed the port behind them, 
pressed her face close to the windov/, 
her heart thumping madly against her 
ribs. 

The dark Plutonian night was bit- 
terly cold, hazy with drifting flakes 
of congealed and frozen atmosphere. 
Overhead, stars glittered with a sort 
of frigid, jewel-like splendor, adding 
a touch of eeriness to the frozen world 
below. 

Miriam jerked nervously at the 
burst of white illumination that sud- 
denly came from the pirate ship. She 
could now see plainly her father and 
the Wanderer striding purposefully 
across the ice crystals. 

A port in the great ship opened and 
a space-clad man whom Miriam in- 
stantly knew to be Lanoth, leaped out. 
The young woman shuddered, almost 
Overwhelmed with nausea, at sight of 
the reptilian horde that poured out of 
the lock behind the pirate leader. 

n ALF man, half crocodile they ap- 
peared to be, walking upright 
upon their short, stubby hindlegs, 
their long, horny tails sliding upon 
the ice. A single large eye, set in the 
center of their foreheads, glowed 
with a baleful luminosity. They 
leaped and cavorted about Lanoth, 
brandishing weapons grasped in their 
webbed hands. They wore no space 
suits, for they were inhabitants of a 
planet far more frigid than Pluto. 

Lanoth waved them back and start- 
ed walking toward the Wanderer. 
The two men halted, facing each other 
at a distance of thirty feet. Brun- 
dage was to the left and slightly back 
of the Wanderer, bis long gun held 
in readiness. 

The communicating device in Mir- 
iam’s helmet brought their conversa- 
tion to her. 

“Ho, Wanderer! We meet at last.” 
“Yes, Lanoth, we meet. But not at 
a time to my liking. I have on board 
my ship a child v/ho is at the very 



68 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



threshold of death. Her life is meas- 
ured in minutes unless Dr. Vacor, the 
prison surgeon, takes her in charge 
immediately. Let me pass with she 
and her mother, and I give you my 
word I shall return — ” 

“What care I if the child dies?” 
Lanoth snarled. “You are, indeed, 
dull of wit. Wanderer, if you do not 
realize that this situation is little 
short of perfect for the fulfillment 
of my plans. I shall cancel the old 
charge against Brundage, as well as 
the one against you.” 

Miriam saw her father surge for- 
ward, heard him rasp: “Damn your 
black soul, Lanoth! I’ll — ” 

A gun flashed in the hand of a rep- 
tile man. Brundage spun, slumped to 
the ice, lay still. 

The Wanderer fell into a crouch, 
came up with mechanical precision, a 
flaming gun grasped in each of his 
metal hands. Lanoth gave ground 
before the terrible fusillade. He had 
not been able to match the Wander- 
er’s lightning double draw. But now 
his guns were out and up, blasting 
forth the hatred of their owner. 

The Wanderer, his own guns jerk- 
ing viciously, marched steadily for- 
ward into the blazing death that hur- 
tled at him from the hands of his ad- 
versary. Behind Lanoth, the reptile 
men held their fire, fearful of strik- 
ing their leader. 

Crouching beside the window in the 
little space ship, Miriam Garth heard 
the clang of bullets against the hel- 
mets and armor of the men on the 
snow plain before her, felt the vibra- 
tion as missiles struck the hull of the 
vessel. 

Brundage was moving, now; was 
getting on his feet. He had only been 
stunned by the bullet. The helmet 
had saved him. 

He brought up his rapid-fire long 
gun, brought it to bear upon Lanoth’s 
followers, pressed the trigger. But 
the pirates closed in upon him, slow- 
ly, inexorably, despite the menace of 
his gun. 

Lanoth and the Wanderer were 
close together now, still blazing away 
at each other. Miriam marveled that 
either of them had survived the with- 



ering fire from the other’s guns. La- 
noth began to weave about from side 
to side. And then the Wanderer 
dropped to one knee. 

“Up!” Miriam shrieked into the 
little microphone in her helmet. “Get 
up. Wanderer!” 

The Wanderer shook his head as if 
to clear his brain, got slowly and 
wearily back to his feet. He took de- 
liberate aim and his left gun spat once 
at the pirate leader. Lanoth stag- 
gered, the weight of his guns swung 
his limp arms to his sides and he 
crashed to the ice in a crumpled heap. 

The reptile men came forward in a 
rush. 

Miriam was about to turn from the 
window when, suddenly, from out of 
the darkness in the direction of the 
penal institute, there charged more 
than a hundred space-clad giants, 
some swinging huge swords above 
their heads, others firing Wauxum 
guns rapidly as they ploughed 
through the frosty ice, dashing 
straight toward the band of half men. 

Some of the pirate crew sought to 
escape by fleeing into their ship. But 
their line was quickly broken, hacked 
to pieces by flickering double-edged 
swords, blasted out of existence by 
guns in capable hands. 

Soon it was all over. Out there on 
the ice lay the members of Lanoth’s 
inhuman crew. None lived save those 
who had sealed themselves in the pi- 
rate ship. 

M ope blossomed anew in Mir- 
iam’s heart. Guards from the 
prison had come to the Wanderer’s 
aid, had defeated the pirates and made 
it possible for Janice to be taken on 
to Dr. Vacor. Perhaps it was not yet 
too late — 

Suddenly Lanoth’s ship shot up- 
ward at an angle, stern first, with half 
her underjets working. The big ves- 
sel rolled and pitched, her banks of 
keel rockets firing intermittently. 
The surviving reptile men were mak- 
ing a desperate effort to take off from 
Pluto. Evidently unskilled hands 
were at the pilot controls. 

The roar of cross talk in Miriam’s 
phone ceased abruptly. An author!- 



WANDERER OF THE VOID

tative voice spoke crisply in the Plu- 
tonian tongue. Then, as the pirate 
craft nosed skyward under power of 
its propulsion rockets, a thin line of 
green flame lanced up from the roof 
of the prison. 

Two glononite shells exploded with 
a fierce white glare against the for- 
ward hull of the laboring space ship. 
A third tore away her jets. She rolled 
over slowly, folded nose upon stern 
and plunged downward, a seared and 
twisted mass of wrecked metal, to a 
final resting place in the bleak moun- 
tain range that fanged the eastern 
sk]/. 

Space piracy in the Universe had 
ended, Miriam knew, with the de- 
struction of that mighty ship. The 
Wanderer’s crusade was finished, and 
the iron man could now unmask, re- 
veal his identity, and retire to a life 
of peace and quiet. Who was the 
Wanderer? And what was the grudge 
that Lanoth had harbored against 
Walter Brundage? 

Brundage, the Wanderer, and two 
of the guardsm.en approached the lit- 
tle ship. They were coming to take 
Janice on to the prison hospital, to 
Dr. Vacor. What would Janice find 
there— life? Yes, possibly. Life in 
the form of an encephalitic lethargy 
that would drift, ultimately, into 
death — 

Miriam’s taut nerves gave way. The 
young woman fainted, slid slowly to 
the floor, still tightly clasping her 
unconscious child to her bosom. 

Later, Miriam Garth opened her 
eyes in the prison hospital. She was 
on a long examining table, and Dr. 
Yedell Vacor was bending over her. 
The huge physician offered a small 
vial filled with a thick, yellow liquid. 
She swallowed the drug and immedi- 
ately felt new life surge through her 
veins. 

Vacor smiled, said: “Our roof look- 
out observed your encounter with the 
pirates, and we sent guardsmen to 
your assistance. They brought you 
here. Your daughter is safe in the 
room with her father.” 

“She — has she regained conscious- 
ness?” 

Vacor’s face clouded. “She has not, 



Mistress Garth. It is a case that baf- 
fles me. Her condition is the same as 
her father’s, and I have been able to 
do nothing for him other than to keep 
him alive with intravenous injections 
of concentrated food, and to take pre- 
cautions against the collapse of his 
digestive system through disuse.” 

“What is the nature of his illness?” 
Miriam asked. 

“Three years ago, Earth time,” said 
Vacor, “when your husband came to 
serve his sentence in this prison, ha 
made a most unusual request. He 
asked to be placed in a chamber that 
had been specially insulated with a 
certain combination of metals. Daniel 
Garth was a scientist of prominence, 
not a man with a criminal record, so 
I, as superintendent of the institution, 
consented. I knew he had sufficient 
reasons. 

“Shortly after his entrance here, he 
fell into a stupor and physical degen- 
eration set in rapidly. The latter 
ceased immediately, however, when 
he was placed in the insulated room. 
I have kept life in him, but I have 
failed to restore him to consciousness 
for one small instant. He is not dis- 
eased; he has fallen before the influ- 
ence of some strange electrical ema- 
nation, the nature of which I cannot 
understand. Neither can I discover 
its source. 

“Your daughter is in the room with 
her father. Perhaps, some day, they 
will recover completely. I do not 
know.” 

M iriam tugged at the physi- 
cian’s sleeve. 

“You have not told me everything, 
Doctor,” she exclaimed, her voice 
edged with hysteria. “A thing like 
this could not just happen. I know 
that this wave of electrical energy 
has been intentionally directed 
against Daniel and Janice by some 
intelligent being, some person who 
wishes to destroy them both. And, if 
they are securely shielded from the 
wave, why do they not regain con- 
sciousness? You have formed some 
theory, Doctor. You must tell me.” 
“You are correct. Mistress Garth, 
in your assumption that a deliberate 



70 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



attempt has been made upon the lives 
of your husband and daughter. I 
have definitely established that fact. 
The prison cosmic ray engineers have 
registered the emanation on their de- 
tectors, but the wave is of such an in- 
finitely high frequency that their in- 
struments are not sufficiently sensi- 
tive to indicate the direction from 
whence it comes — ” 

“But you have not explained why 
they do not regain consciousness.” 
Vacor spoke slov.'ly. “Indeed I 
have not. And I find it the most dif- 
ficult of all explanations. I am a 
medical man, not a scientist well 
versed in electrodynamics or cosmic 
ray radiation, so I shall make the situ- 
ation as clear to you as I possibly 
can. 

“The human body, as well as any 
given amount of matter, vibrates at a 
certain frequency peculiar to its own 
size, weight, and chemical composi- 
tion. To subject a human body to a 
wave whose frequency is the same as 
its own would bring about a number 
of physical changes. The brain would 
be most disastrously affected, since it 
is the seat of the senses. The fierce 
upheaval of the identical frequencies 
beating together would almost in- 
stantly obliterate the mind, drive out 
the ego, the intelligence. Next, there 
would follow a general breaking 
down of the vital organs — ” 

There was a deathlike pallor upon 
Miriam’s face and her voice sounded 
hollow in the great room. 

“Then the minds of Daniel and 
Janice have been utterly destroyed.” 
“Not destroyed,” Vacor said, “but 
released from their bodies.” He mo- 
tioned toward the darkness beyond 
the window. “They are out there, 
perhaps — or in this very room with 
us. We do not know, cannot know 
unless they return to their bodies. 
Let us hope they do so.” 

Miriam pondered the immensity of 
the thought. It was beyond credence. 
Human intelligences torn from their 
fleshy garments to be hurled naked 
out — into eternity? Where else? 
Drifters in time and space. Would 
they ever return to their bodies, or 
was there some unknown and immu- 



table physical law that would pre- 
vent — 

At this point Walter Brundage 
came to the table. 

“Lanoth has regained consciousness 
and wishes to make a statem.ent before 
he dies,” he said. “The Wanderer 
wants you as a witness, Doctor.” 

They crossed the large room and 
entered a small operating cell in the 
surgery department on the left. 

The Wanderer and a prison physi- 
cian stood at either end of a metal 
table on which there lay a broad- 
shouldered young Earthman. The 
dying man turned his head slightly 
so that his failing eyes might bear 
upon the newcomers. 

Miriam Garth gasped. 

“Why,” she faltered, “why, it’s 
Jean. Jean Gossard. I can’t believe 
it.” 

“Yes, Miriam,” the white-faced man 
on the table murmured, “Jean Gos- 
sard, your childhood playmate, is 
Bors Lanoth, the pirate. I make this 
statement so that I may find some 
measure of peace in death — ” 

Lanoth — or Gossard — coughed, 
blood bubbling on his lips. Dr. Vacor 
administered a stimulant. The pirate 
rested a moment, then went on : 

“As you know, Miriam, Daniel 
Garth and I both loved you when we 
were youngsters on Earth. You cared 
only for Daniel. This caused me to 
hate him, to hate you, to hate even 
your father. Neither of you ever sus- 
pected it, for I guarded my secret 
closely. My hatred flamed higher 
when Daniel finished his science 
course at the university with high 
honors, while I failed miserably. 
Something happened to my mind — I 
do not know what — and I swore to 
make each of you pay dearly for 
what I then considered a great wrong.

there, Miriam, to supervise personally

was close at hand. And when you 
and Daniel joined him it was I who 
took the cargo of denexium which 
Daniel Garth was accused of stealing. 
I worked out the false evidence that 
convicted him. He is innocent.” 

A pained expression twisted the 
features of Walter Brundage. He 
bowed his head. 

“I should have known it,” he mut- 
tered. “I am sorry, Miriam.” 

Miriam placed her cheek against 
her father’s shoulder, took his big 
hand in her small ones. 

Lanoth’s words came again, in a 
whisper ; 

“And it was I who subjected Daniel 
to the ray that forced his intelligence 
from his body. But I did not direct 
a wave against his daughter. She, 
after attaining a certain age and size, 
and being the child of Daniel Garth 
and consequently of similar chemical 
construction, became affected by a 
harmonic of the fundamental wave 
from my transmitter. She became at- 
tuned in much the manner as we, in 
order to escape etheric noises and dis- 
tortion, adjust our visigraph receiv- 
ers to a harmonic of the transmitting 
station.” 

“Why did you not transmit this 
wave against Garth early in his year 
of bonded freedom?” Vacor asked. 

“I wished to, greatly,” Lanoth re- 
plied feebly, “because I feared he 
would trace the stolen denexium to 
its buyer on Mars. But I did not per- 
fect my transmitter until the latter 
part of the year. Then, mmch experi- 
mentation was necessary in order to 
determine the natural wave length of 
his body.” 

“Where is this transmitter?” Brun- 
dage demanded. 

“It was destroyed with my ship. 
There is no longer an emanation.” La- 
noth turned his head slightly. “Now, 
Wanderer — you have — vanquished 
me. The — the universe is waiting — > 
to learn your identity. Tell them — • 
as you promised. And — ” 

And Jean Gossard, alias Bors La- 
noth the pirate, was dead. 

But the Wanderer said nothing. He 



was leaning against the wall for sup- 
port, his arms hanging motionless at 
his sides, the red glow in his electric' 
eyes dimming rapidly. 

Miriam suddenly remembered that 
she had seen him shot down in his 
battle with the pirate. “The Wan- 
derer is wounded !” she cried. “La- 
noth shot him!” 

“I will attend him,” Vacor ex- 
claimed. 

As Vacor started toward the Wan- 
derer a young physician dashed into 
the room. 

“Dr. Vacor!” he said breathlessly. 
“Daniel Garth and the child are re- 
gaining consciousness. Come quick- 
ly.” 

With a glad cry, Miriam ran past 
the young doctor and out of the room. 
Brundage and Vacor, supporting the 
Wanderer between them, followed. 

A weak and slightly emaciated 
Daniel Garth sat on the side of his 
cot, smiling. Miriam flung herself 
into her husband’s arms, tears of glad- 
ness streaming dov^n her cheeks. 

“Daniel !” she choked. 

Garth spoke soft words of greet- 
ing. 

Little Janice, who sat on the cot 
beside her father, said : “That was a 
bad old dream I had, daddy.” 

Brundage and Vacor came in with 
the limp, heavy body of the Wanderer 
sagging between them. Both spoke 
heartily to Garth. 

Daniel Garth laughed. 

“Do not concern yourselves further 
with that heap of metal,” he said. 
“Toss it into a corner. I have finished 
with it.” 

The two men stared. 

“What do you mean?” Vacor asked 
quickly, suspiciously. 

“I mean,” said Garth, “that you are 
burdening yourselves with an inani- 
mate object.” 

Brundage turned to Vacor. 

“Perhaps his brain is not yet clear,” 
he said. 

ARTH laughed again. “My mind 
is perfectly clear, I assure you. 

I will explain. I built that robot in 
my laboratory on Merthel some years 
ago. 1 synthesized a brain which I

placed in its skull. The auditory 
nerves are connected with the micro- 
phones that serve as ears, the optical 
nerves with the retinascopic photo- 
electric cells, and the nerves of speech 
with the reproducer. 

“The motor nerves, Doctor, are con- 
nected with the mechanism that acti- 
vates the robot’s body, delicate relays 
making and breaking the different cir- 
cuits in the course of motivation. 
Power comes from a small, almost in- 
exhaustible battery of my own design. 
The brain is nourished by a certain 
fluid a pump circulates through it.” 

V ACOR and Brundage placed the 
robot in a chair. 

“It is marvelous,” Vacor murmured. 
“I do not fully understand how the 
synthetic brain — ” 

“I am coming to that,” Garth went 
on. “Years ago on Earth, Jean Gos- 
sard — Bors Lanoth — and I experi- 
mented with a high frequency wave 
which we hoped would release the hu- 
man intelligence from the body. We 
obtained little success and gave up. 
On Merthel I experimented further, 
wishing to liberate my own intelli- 
gence so that I might project it into 
the brain of the robot. 

“Then I was convicted of stealing 
a cargo of denexium and was forced 
to give up my laboratory work. To- 
ward the latter part of my year of 
bonded freedom, I traced the denex- 
ium to a certain buyer in Dotho, Mars. 
I secreted myself in this buyer’s ware- 
house several times and gained much 
information. I learned that it was 
Lanoth who had stolen the stuff and 
made it appear that I was the thief. 

“I further learned that Lanoth was 
about to loose a secret wave against 
me. The pirate was aware of my ef- 
fort to trace the metal, and he did 
not want me to prove my innocence. 

“Peculiar physical symptoms which 
I experienced later indicated that La- 
noth had started transmitting his 
wave. The symptoms disappeared be- 
fore I had suffered to any great ex- 



tent only to return at regular intef- 
vals for several days. Then they 
ceased. 

“The realiaation suddenly came to 
me that this was the sanie ray with 
which Gossard and I had experiment- 
ed on Earth. Lanoth, then, must be 
Jean Gossard. And he was seeking 
to find the natural wave length of my 
body. Soon he would be successful. 

“With only a few days of liberty 
remaining to me, I hastened to Mer- 
thel, changed the appearance of my 
space ship, placed the robot on board 
and hid the ship in a mountain range 
near Brundage City. Then I came 
here to start serving my sentence, and 
requested the insulated room. I want- 
ed Lanoth’s ray to release my intelli- 
gence, but I wished my body shielded 
against physical deterioration. 

“When the ray forced out my in- 
telligence I — I shall call my intelli- 
gence T’ — entered the brain of the 
robot and started a warfare against 
Lanoth and piracy in general. I, too, 
perfected a ray transmitter and incor- 
porated it in the body of the robot, 
in order that I might project my ego 
out of the synthetic brain when nec- 
essary. 

“I released my intelligence tonight 
just after Lanoth died and I — my in- 
telligence — went out to assist Janice’s 
drifting ego back into her little body. 
You have heard Lanoth’s statement; 
now, with mine, you have a clear pic- 
ture of the whole affair.” 

Walter Brundage stepped forward. 

“My boy,” he said huskily, “I do 
not know what to say about the part 
I took in prosecuting you. What can 
I do?” 

“Erase it from your memory,” Garth 
told him. 

The thunder of Vacor’s voice filled 
the room. 

“By N’yuih, Garth! Then you 
are — ” 

Daniel Garth clasped his wife and 
daughter to him. 

“I am, or was,” he said, “the Wan- 
derer of the Void.”

The ASTOUNDING 



CHAPTER I 
A Dying World 

M ERNOQ stood alone upon 
the balcony. At his back 
towered the observatory 
with its mammoth telescope. Below 
the balcony, rough, rocky clif¥s fell 
away to meet the restless sea which 
rolled and tossed fretfully. 

He swept the vast panorama before 
him with lidless eyes. From this 
prominence the country was visible 
for miles. Off to one side, in the dis- 
tance, loomed jagged peaks. On one 
of these stood a power plant, an en- 
ergy radiator, one of the countless 
broadcasters which dotted Earth in 
the portions still inhabited by men. 

The man, if such he could be called, 
gazed into the darkening heavens. 



Behind the observatory the sun hung 
low in the sky. It had been that way 
for several hours, its slow movement 
barely perceptible. Earth’s rotation 
was many times slower after five mil- 
lion years. 

Mernoq himself represented an 
amazing spectacle. He was a man 
whom his ancestors of five million 
years before would have disowned as 
an incredible monster. Given a lati- 
tude of fifty thousand centuries, evo- 
lution had worked strange pranks on 
mankind. The biped which had held 
reign over Earth’s dominions for the 
greater share of his long, varied ex- 
istence was much unlike his predeces- 
sors of the remotely distant mechani- 
cal age. 

Was it fate, coincidence, or a domi- 
nating, undying spark which had seen

mankind triumphant over all obstacles 
which had beset his path? Since the 
mechanical age, man had alternately 
scaled the heights of Utopia and had 
tasted the dregs of chaos and degene- 
ration. Oblivion’s stark shadow had 
fallen often across the portals of civ- 
ilization, yet the human race had 
proved itself undying. 

Years of worldly strife had come 
and gone, insect scourges had threat- 
ened and nearly won, pestilence had 
waved its grimy scepter throughout 
the Solar System, and there had been 
interplanetary warfare. Worst of all, 
there had come invasion by space 
wanderers, creatures from the far-off 
stars, nearly invincible and equally 
as threatening. Mankind on its plan- 
ets and moons of the Solar System had 
suffered enslavement. Only by the

vaders. This had happened long ago, 
yet the Earthmen remembered. 

Mernoq was a typical Earthman. 
He stood between four and five feet 
in height. Standing upright on two 
legs which were jointed to move in 
either of two directions, he had four 
arms, two on each side, each member 
terminating in eight fingers. The legs 
were much longer than the body. 
During the last hundred thousand 
years or more, the body had grown 
smaller, due to the increasing diminu- 
tion and final disappearance of the di- 
gestive tract and organs of respira- 
tion. 

To keep alive, humanity no longer 
found it necessary to eat and breathe. 
Science had supplanted the compara- 
tively short existence of the gastric 
organs with a more practical means 
of austenance. Man’s radioactive blood 
was kept charged with energy from 
the huge broadcasting units. Oxygen 
was superfluous. In this manner the 
life span had been materially in- 
creased until a life of ten thousand 
years had become common. 

The head of Mernoq had neither 
mouth nor nostrils. Like the appen- 
dix of man, the unused mouth had 
finally disappeared. Food no longer 
existed, and articulate speech had 
long since yielded to mental telepa- 
thy. On either side of the head were 
slightly elongated ears, curved to 
catch the slightest of sounds. Two 
black, lidless eyes peered intently 
from the face, intelligence radiating 
from their depths. Humanity had 
done away v/ith sleep. Like food and 
oxygen, it v/as no longer necessary. 
The energy broadcasters recharged 
the body constantly. 

Hair, that telltale mark of barbar- 
ism, had become unknown among 
Earthmen. Instead of hair, there aro.se 
from the head fully two dozen anten- 
nae. These served a double purpose. 
They picked up the thought waves of 
their fellowmen and also received the 
broadcasted energy which supplied 
their bodies. 

Mernoq stood looking at the distant 
broadcaster which threw pink waves 
of light in every direction. From this 
station he and the members of the ob- 



servatory staff received the energy 
their bodies required. Reception, ex- 
cept in the case of the more powerful 
broadcasters, was limited to a thou- 
sand miles or less. 

number of broadcasters in 
jE. one vicinity varied in accordance 
with the amount of population. There 
were few spots on Earth’s surface 
v<?here one stood in danger of starva- 
tion. 

Turning, Mernoq entered the ob- 
servatory, climbing a few short steps 
to where several of his companions 
were grouped about a table. Upon it 
stood intricate machines. Several of 
the Earthmen were gazing at a large 
screen upon which the great telescope 
projected what it saw. A large pair 
of fiery stars occupied the center of 
the field. Mernoq spoke mentally. 
The antennae of his comrades quiv- 
ered slightly in attentiveness. 

“The long night will soon be upon 
us with its terrible coldness. Then 
we must retreat into the sealed cham- 
bers.” 

“Sirius is nov/ nearing the zenith.” 

Eloow indicated the bright double 
star with a wave of his arm. 

“It is time that Uljoph returned,” 
said one of the others. “He has been 
gone over thirty-five years on his ex- 
pedition to the twin suns of Sirius.” 

“A rumor has come to me,” said 
Mernoq. “Do not yet fear that the 
expedition has become lost in space. 
Perhaps tonight our telescope may 
pick up the returning space ship.” 

“A rumor — w'nat have you heard?” 

Manipulating a set of controls at 
his side, Eloow looked up inquiringly 
into the face of Mernoq. The rest 
watched the screen eagerly. Sirius 
dimm.ed away into the distance as the 
telescopic field was brought closer to 
Earth. Vacuum yawned blackly at 
them. 

“Black — and empty!” Reod ex- 
claimed. 

Mernoq remained silent in spite of 
this gloomy remark. He was think- 
ing deeply. Earth was a dying planet. 
A space expedition had been sent to 
Alpha Centauri in an effort to find a 
planet outside the dead Solar System 



THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS 



79 



to which mankind might migrate. Al- 
pha Centauri was found to possess 
sixteen planets — none of them, how- 
ever, suitable for habitation. The ex- 
pedition to Sirius had immediately 
followed. 

“We shall wait five years more,” 
said Mernoq, “and then another ex- 
pedition will start out for still an- 
other star.” 

“But where?” 

“It has not been definitely decided. 
Many of the nearer stars have been 
suggested. But we shall give this ex- 
pedition time to prove itself. Both 
Uljoph and Aamon are among the 
best commanders of the Earthmen.” 

“Why didn’t you go yourself in- 
stead of Aamon? He has always 
seemed bitter against you for your 
unparalleled success, especially be- 
cause the Earthmen have placed their 
faith and reliance in you to lead 
them.” 

“I know,” Mernoq replied. “That 
is the very reason I sent him. I gave 
him the chance to distinguish himself 
along with Uljoph. Aamon is a men- 
tal genius and should be encouraged !” 

“What of tonight?” Eloow wanted 
to know. “You said you had had 
word.” 

“We have observed nothing with 
our telescope,” replied Mernoq. “The 
observatory at Yigni, however, has 
sent me strange reports. As you are 
probably aware, they not only have 
the most powerful telescope in the 
world, but the most erratic one. They 
have sacrificed clarity for greater 
magnification. I received a report 
from Bralel who is stationed there. 
He reports seeing a flash of the expe- 
dition’s space ship returning from 
Sirius. The vision blotted and faded. 
He gave me his telescopic figures. 
If those at Yigni really saw the space 
ship coming home, I calculated that it 
would show up on our screen either 
today or else tonight.” 

T his information acted as balm 
for the impatience of the Earth- 
men. But fully two months were to 
elapse before the space ship actually 
arrived. Radio communication at 
that distance was impossible. Civili- 



zation waited expectantly — and anx- 
iously. Failure had crowned a previ- 
ous effort. Optimism, however, ruled 
to such a marked extent that partial 
preparations had been made for a de- 
parture from Earth. The laboratories 
and workshops were kept busy. One 
Question was uppermost in the minds 
of all. Had Uljoph and Aamon found 
a perfect world in the system of Siri- 
us, or had failure fallen upon the 
Earthmen once more? 

And then one day the ship arrived, 
plumbing Earth’s waning atmosphere 
at a greatly reduced speed. Out of it 
poured the forces of Uljoph and 
Aamon. They were unusually jubi- 
lant and seemed glad to be among 
their own kind once more after a de- 
parture of three and a half decades. 
They immediately joined Mernoq. 

“Why did you not radio?” he asked 
them. 

“Our proximity with Sirius de- 
stroyed many vital parts of our send- 
ing apparatus, but we heard your mes- 
sages before entering the Solar Sys- 
tem,” Uljoph replied. 

“it will be necessary to construct 
our sending apparatus on different 
principles when we return once more 
within the influence of Sirius,” stated 
Aamon. 

“Return?” echoed Mernoq. “Then 
you have been successful!” 

“We have!” was the enthusiastic 
reply. 

it was a colorful story which Uljoph 
related. After fifteen years of space 
flight, they had reached Sirius, dis- 
covering that it possessed twenty- 
seven planets. The planets, varying 
in size, presented varying conditions. 
Many of them had moons. Commenc- 
ing from the innermost planet, the 
Earthmen had explored them all, even 
to the outermost world distantly re- 
moved from the dazzling orbs of 
Sirius. 

Two worlds had been found to be 
ideal. They were the sixth and 
eighth planets. The seventh world 
was habitable but was overrun with 
rank vegetation and loathsome forms 
of life. Zyse, the sixth planet, was 
much to be preferred. Bexn, the 
eighth world, teemed with animal life. 



80 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



boasting a strange race of intelligent 
creatures. Zyse was by far the most 
beautiful world of the entire system. 

“We must desert this worn-out 
world,” said Mernoq. “The vanguard 
of our people will soon start for 
Zyse.” 

“But there must be more prepara- 
tions made,” Aamon argued. “We 
cannot start at once.” 

Mernoq saw with disappointment 
that Aamon’s attitude was antagonis- 
tic. He saw enmity in his glance, the 
enmity which Mernoq hoped he 
would have lost on the trip to Sirius. 
The great leader’s reply, however, was 
conciliatory. 

“Yes, preparations are indeed nec- 
essary before the greater share of us 
leave for the new world,” he admit- 
ted. “Yet, during your absence, our 
optimism led us to construct many 
space ships. A vast fleet of them is 
equipped and ready now on Mars.” 

“No. I do not intend leaving for 
the new system until the last con- 
tingent goes. That will be a long 
time yet. I shall go with the last ships 
which are to carry the valuable kletin 
metal now stored on Venus.” 

Months later, the waiting space 
ships on the planet Mars headed for 
Zyse. They were the forerunners of 
the exodus, the first ships to leave the 
old System. From that time on, ships 
continually left for the new home 
planet until several years later there 
were but a few left. Strangely 
enough, Aamon showed no desire to 
head contingents to Zyse. Mernoq 
was glad, for Aamon was valuable and 
seemed to have got over his old envy. 



CHAPTER II 
Beneath the Monolith 



HEARTH had become nearly aban- 
doned as Mernoq and two hun- 
dred of his men stood on the desolate 
planet Venus. The sun’s huge globe 
hung just at the edge of the horizon. 
Venus had ceased rotating. One side 
forever faced the sun, a red, hot hem- 
isphere. The other side, frozen cold 
by the temperature of space, lay dark 



and as equally deserted. 

The atmosphere was gone, A ter- 
rific war with the invaders from a 
distant star had destroyed the en- 
velope of air, ripped open fissures in 
the planet, released the inner ele- 
ments and had blown the cruel invad- 
ers into eternity. 

Venus was as dead and deserted as 
Earth’s moon — or Mars. Stars shone 
crystal clear all about the sun, gleam- 
ing and twinkling. In space suits, 
the forces of Mernoq walked over the 
cold surface of the planet. Mernoq 
had brought the space ship to rest 
upon the narrow, thousand mile strip 
of shadowland between the cold and 
flaming hemispheres of the dead 
world. Mernoq now gave instruc- 
tions to Aamon. 

“Stay with the ship while we de- 
scend into the underground chambers 
after the kletin metal. Be sure that 
the energy broadcaster continues to 
function properly. We shall be back 
shortly.” 

Enclosed in the bulky space suits 
with their multitude of exterior ap- 
paratus, the Earthmen headed for a 
tall monolith rising from a clump of 
rocks which strewed its base. Reod 
shone a peculiar ray of green inten- 
sity from his space suit upon the 
broad base of the tov/er. Almost im- 
mediately a doorway opened. In a 
long line the weird cavalcade filed 
inside and down a broad flight of steps 
into a large chamber. The walls 
glowed, radiating an ethereal light of 
their own. 

In the center of the chamber stood 
a massive machine, its various parts 
formed of intricate apparatus. This 
was the auxiliary energy broadcaster 
to be used in case the one on the space 
ship failed, or in the event that the 
space ship was moved away from the 
vicinity. The sides of the vast cham- 
ber were pierced with small doorways 
leading to the storerooms of the kle- 
tin. When charged with a peculiar 
force of light produced by the Earth- 
men, this metal furnished gravity for 
the floors of space ships. It was to 
be found in large quantities upon the 
planet Uranus, and the Earthmen had 
mined considerable of it on this far 



THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS 



81 



planet and moved it to Venus for 
storage. 

In groups, the Earthmen entered 
the storerooms and started the remov- 
al of the kletin. Mernoq saw one of 
the Earthmen walk toward him with 
a load in his four arms. It was Ibaeg, 
and his action seemed a strange one. 
Others were also emerging from the 
storerooms with the metal, but with 
the exception of Ibaeg they were all 
heading for the broad stairway lead- 
ing to the surface. 

“Ibaeg, where are you taking that?” 

The man made no reply, but hurried 
his pace. He ran straight for the en- 
ergy broadcaster. Mernoq and his 
subordinates were standing at the op- 
posite end of the machine. Ibaeg was 
approaching from the other side. 
Sensing trouble of some sort, Uljoph 
hurried toward Ibaeg, seeking to in- 
tercept him. But he was not quick 
enough. Striding up to the dormant 
energy plant, Ibaeg threw with all 
four arms his load of metal into the 
mechanism. There came a crashing 
note of twisted parts. 

M ernoq stared aghast at this 
strange action, uncomprehend- 
ing. The miscreant legged it for the 
flight of stairs, those near him too 
surprised to think of pursuit. Be- 
sides, Aamon and more of the Earth- 
men were in the space ship outside. 
Ibaeg could not escape. His action 
had been that of a madman. It was 
seemingly pointless. 

At the foot of the stairs, Uljoph 
stopped and stared upward. 

“Are you mad?” he demanded. 
Ibaeg made no reply. He was near- 
ly to the doorv/ay v/hich led from the 
monolith’s base when a terrific roar 
shook the subterranean chamber. 
Then came a mighty concussion as if 
a gigantic body had thudded against 
the ground far above. With a fright- 
ful crash and billowing accompani- 
ment of dust, a great white boulder 
sv/ept Ibaeg off his feet and beneath 
it, rolling dovm the stone steps, 
grinding them to powder and smash- 
ing into the rocky wall. Uljoph 
leaped out of the way just in time. 
The curtain of rock dust spread 



like a veil as large pieces fell from 
the fractured wall blocking the up- 
ward passage completely. 

“The monolith has fallen!” ex- 
claimed Reod. He stared at the ruins 
in dismay. “There was an explosion!” 
All became quiet. The rock dust 
settled slowly. For a moment the 
Earthmen surveyed the clogged pas- 
sage in mental silence. Not a square 
foot of opening was left. They were 
sealed as if in a tomb. 

“We must signal Aamon! He can 
dig us out with disintegrators.” 

A call was sent out to Aamon. The 
reply which came back jarred the sen- 
sibilities of the Earthman worse than 
had the strange action of Ibaeg or the 
succeeding explosion of the monolith. 

“Mernoq — your reign is at an end!” 
came his vindictive thought waves. 
“Ibaeg did his work well ! The broad- 
caster is broken, and you are en- 
tombed! When I leave for Earth, 
you will all die! I shall be free to 
build my own empire in the new sys- 
tem of planets !” 

“But my men — I have loyal men 
aboard ship!” exclaimed Mernoq, 
more out of surprise and consterna- 
tion than contradiction. 

“Dead, Mernoq, all dead — just as 
you shall soon be!” gloated Aamon. 
“My supporters are many ! I now re- 
turn to Earth where I shall set a time 
explosion to detonate the Earth’s at- 
mosphere in the same manner em- 
ployed by the Earthmen who de- 
stroyed the atmosphere of Venus ages 
ago !” 

“You are mad, Aamon!” 

“I shall be safe — far beyond the So- 
lar System — when the cataclysm takes 
place! When I reach Zyse I shall 
conquer the Martian vanguard of 
ships and all other ships which have 
left since then! I, alone, shall be all 
powerful! Now die, Mernoq, you and 
all your puppets !” 

Mernoq looked around at his com- 
panions who were stricken dumb by 
the rapid succession of events all 
planned so well by the evil genius of 
Aamon. In each other’s eyes they read 
the agreement of the certain doom to 
befall them. The space ship, contain- 
ing the source of their sustenance.

was gone. The auxiliary plant in the 
chamber where they stood was 
wrecked. Their situation was truly 
desperate. 

have two hours in which 
w W to live,” was Mernoq’s quiet, 
yet deadly ultimatum. “We may be 
able to repair the damage which Ibaeg 
did, but, unless we hurry such re- 
pairs — ” 

Several of the Earthmen who were 
skilled mechanics set to work on the 
damaged broadcaster. They worked 
steadily, removing the damaged parts 
and repairing them. Time moved by. 
An insidious sensation of weakness 
commenced creeping over the Earth- 
men. 

Suddenly one workman sw'ayed diz- 
zily. Another workman sprang to the 
task, taking the place of his fallen 
comrade. Mernoq experienced a 
strong urge to sit down. His legs 
seemed no longer capable of holding 
his body upright. He fought desper- 
ately against this urge. When his 
knees sagged, he was promptly caught 
in the arms of a companion who eased 
him gently to the floor. 

“The time?” he inquired. “How 
long have we?” 

“Less than half an hour for most 
of us,” was the grim reply. “A few 
of us may last even longer than that.” 

Mernoq felt himself lapsing into 
unconsciousness. Fully three-quar- 
ters of the Earthmen had weakened 
and fallen. Some retained their senses 
yet were too feeble to move. The lack 
of energy was making itself felt. 

“The — the lever,” came the weak, 
mental communication from one of 
the Earthmen who staggered to the 
machine with the two remaining parts. 
Two of his companions weaved in the 
direction of the starting lever while 
the other stood at his side to assist 
him. 

Behind them, Mernoq rose weakly 
upon his four hands. A strong, sub- 
conscious prompting had returned 
him to consciousness. He seemed un- 
able to rise. He watched Cyponom 
reach for the lever with one hand, his 
remaining three arms clinging to va- 
rious nearby portions of the machine 



to support his sagging body. 

Yxlese reeled helplessly against his 
fellow mechanic, dropping the re- 
maining bit of apparatus in its place. 
The piece had only to be fastened. 
Yxlese reached out weakly to give the 
necessary twist. His arms stiffened 
and never reached the mechanism, for 
his supporting comrade fell, Yxlese 
slumping across his inert body. 

Through a haze of semi-conscious- 
ness, Cyponom watched Mernoq crawl 
forward through an effort of tremen- 
dous will power, reach the machine 
and pull himself slowly upward. A 
dizzy mist obscured the vision of Cy- 
ponom. When it cleared, he saw 
Mernoq sag backward and hit the 
floor. Cyponom’s heart sank. At the 
last vital moment, failure had mocked 
them. He was the only one left with 
his senses — part of them — and they 
were rapidly leaving him. He clung 
tight, but seemed too weak to hang on 
any longer. He felt his grip weak- 
ening. 

His eyes wandered to the part 
which Mernoq had made one final ef- 
fort to reach and turn. His heart 
skipped a beat. It was fastened! 
Mernoq had reached it! A darkness 
overwhelmed Cyponom. The final or- 
der from his brain commanded three 
reluctant arms to drop their holds and 
seize the lever which the other arm 
held with its eight fingers. 

As Cyponom fell, the weight of his 
body pulled the lever. A grinding 
noise issued from the machine. Pink 
vibrations of light danced from the 
apparatus, forming a shimmer of color 
around it. Strewed about the vast 
chamber lay nearly two hundred un- 
conscious Earthmen, many of them 
close to death. 



CHAPTER III 
Entombed 

T he broadcaster roared into ac- 
tion. Soon the reviving Earth- 
men, their antennae picking up the 
energy from the waves which pene- 
trated their space suits, commenced 
to rise, ‘

THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS

“How much better off are we now?” 
lamented Reod. “We are entombed !” 

“We are alive,” returned Mernoq 
spiritedly, “and while life still exists 
within our bodies we may yet dare to 
hope.” 

The philosophy of Mernoq was 
sound. Upon this philosophy man- 
kind had clung tenaciously to life 
throughout the ages in the face of ad- 
versity. 

“How are we to reach Earth with- 
out space ships, even if we do escape 
this place?” queried Uljoph. 

“Reaching Earth is but half as im- 
portant as sending out a warning of 
Aamon’s treachery and his plans to 
explode the atmosphhere.” 

“But we have no way of getting to 
Earth, nor any way of signalling, in 
time to forestall Aamon’s plan,” said 
Uljoph. 

“I have a plan,” Mernoq told them, 
“a desperate plan, one depending 
upon close calculations and long 
chances, but first we must get free of 
this place.” 

Mernoq would not divulge his 
hopes. First, he said, they must win 
through to the surface of Venus. The 
outlook was discouraging. On three 
sides solid rock surrounded them. 
The bowels of the planet lay beneath 
their feet, while overhead lay heavy 
strata of mantle rock. The avenue 
before them was blocked with massive 
fragments of the great monolith in- 
terspersed with rock debris from the 
cracked walls of the passage. 

“I once heard of a secret exit from 
this place,” said Nenerm. 

“Where is it?” 

“I do not know,” was the uncertain 
reply. “These chambers are old. No 
one alive can remember when they 
were built. There is a legend telling 
of an attempted escape of the space 
invaders long ago. A group of them 
burrowed deep inside Venus. They 
were all destroyed by the earthquakes 
which followed the destruction of the 
atmosphere. A passage from these 
caverns is supposed to lead through 
their secret exit.” 

“Then why were these caverns not 
destroyed by the quakes ?” asked 
Mernoq. 



“That is what throws doubt on the 
truth of the legend,” replied Nanerm, 
“yet the legend exists.” | 

Mernoq at once ordered his men to 
tap the rock walls in search of hol- 
lows beyond. The Earthmen spread 
out into small groups, searching care- 
fully the adjoining storerooms as well 
as the central chamber. Both wall ' 
and floor space was nearly covered 
before an excited, telepathic commu- 
nication burned itself upon his brain. 
“We have found it!” 

Mernoq and his subordinate officers 
hurried to the spot. Several of the 
Earthmen held back a section of rock 
which balanced nicely on a convex 
axis. A dark passageway lay beyond. 
Uljoph advanced into it, but Mernoq 
motioned him back. 

“Let the stone swing into place,” 
he said. “We must be sure that it is 
dependable and will open at the right 
time in case we must return this way.” 

T he stone swung back. As Mer- 
noq had feared, the opening of 
the secret door had been gropingly 
accidental. After much experiment, 
the concealed exit was reopened. A 
combination of pressure movements 
on the nearby wall was necessary. 
Mernoq and his men took careful note 
of these. He was then satisfied to en- 
ter. He detailed twenty of the Earth- 
men to stay with the energy broad- 
caster and keep it working properly. 

“Watch it carefully. Our lives and 
yours depend upon it. We shall fol- 
low this passage to the end. If we 
fail to reach the surface, we shall re- 
turn. If we win through, we shall 
communicate with you when we ar- 
rive back at the spot where the mono- 
lith stood.” 

With these parting instructions, 
Mernoq and the remainder of the 
Earthmen snapped on the glowing 
lights of their space suits and filed 
into the cavity out of sight around a 
bend in the tunnel. The opening was 
closed softly behind them. 

They tramped for miles through 
the interior of Venus, the tunnel slop- 
ing gradually downward. Mernoq 
commenced to despair of ever reach- , 
ing the surface, yet he was determined ' 



S4 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



to follov? the tunnel to its termina- 
tion. It became warm, excessively 
so. Although the surface of Venus 
was dead and cold, the interior was 
not. The Earthmen became aware of 
this more than ever as the passage 
continued its downward slant. 

Then through the gloom ahead of 
them they saw the end of the subter- 
ranean passage. It ended blankly, 
yet, as they approached nearer, and 
their lights dispelled the shadows, 
they saw faint, square outlines of a 
huge door. A vague murmur beyond 
made them pause and grow apprehen- 
sive. Mernoq broke the suspense by 
ordering it opened. 

Several of the Earthmen seized the 
huge, metal pull, shaking loose from 
it the dust of ages. No lock was in 
evidence. Constructed of stone and 
metal, the door was massively built, 
towering far above the height of the 
Earthmen who tugged at it. Con- 
trary to the expectations of Mernoq, 
however, the door opened easily, part- 
ly of its own volition, so it seemed, 
as if it had waited patiently through 
the long centuries. Had the Earth- 
men only known it, the door had re- 
mained closed for more than a quar- 
ter million years. 

A black dust vomited forth from 
the doorway, whirling and falling 
among the Earthmen. There followed 
a rumble like a thunderclap. Beyond 
the doorway lay a vast cavern whose 
• high walls threw back the red and 
green glow of lurid flames. To their 
startled eyes were revealed long 
tongues of fire shooting up to lick 
the ceiling. They were no such flames 
as the burning of oxygen might pro- 
duce. The flames were red, and termi- 
nated in oval tips edged with a blue- 
green luminosity. 

“Come!” 

Mernoq strode fearlessly in ^i.-e di- 
rection of the raging inferno. His 
men followed. In warm, palpable dust 
which rose nearly to their knees, they 
walked slowly toward the brilliant 
fire which, as they approached nearer, 
they found issuing from a broad, deep 
crevice in the cavern floor. 

"The internal fires of Venus!” 

“I never believed they came so close 



to the surface.” 

They stopped at the edge of the fife 
pit and looked across to where the 
cavern stretched away into the gloom. 
Dimly visible were several rocky 
corridors. Mernoq lingered for a mo- 
ment, undecided as to directions, but 
he saw that one end of the crevice 
might be skirted, and ordered the cor- 
ridors to be explored. They circled 
the flaming cauldron to see what lay 
beyond. Uljoph drew Mernoq’s at- 
tention to the cavern ceiling. 

I T was perfectly circular. The cav- 
ern was not artificial. An intelli- 
gence had constructed it. Was the 
legend true? Had the invaders fash- 
ioned this place as a tomb or hidea- 
way, or had mankind made their way 
to the internal fires long ago in the 
forgotten past? Mernoq wondered. 
They walked close to the ragged edge 
of the crevice and peered downward. 
The fiery hell was fully a hundred 
yards across, lurid flames obscuring 
the bottom. Hidden by the flames, a 
boiling inferno of molten rock gushed 
in and out of the planet’s interior. 

A mental cry of terror issued from 
across the darting flames. The anten- 
nae on Mernoq’s head told him the 
directions from which the cry had 
come. Rapidly, he and his compan- 
ions circled the fire pit and raced into 
the corridor from which the cry had 
issued. Other Earthmen were excit- 
edly milling about inside. 

In the center of the throng they 
came upon a ghastly scene. Seven 
Earthmen lay dead, mutilated, their 
space suits crushed and ripped. The 
bodies had been torn to shreds. 

For a moment, in the horror of the 
situation, no one saw the large boxes 
whose ends flanked the passage. They 
lay on shelves. Uljoph was first to 
discover them. He climbed over the 
side of one and looked down into the 
metal container. His mind ejaculated 
one thought. 

“Empty!” 

Meanwhile, others were examining 
more of the strange boxes. Reod’s 
warning came too late, for a long 
tentacle slid up over the side of a 
container, sharp, metal claws embrac- 



THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS

ing an inquisitive and unsuspecting 
Earthman. Zougmre wriggled to free 
himself. A monstrous body surmount- 
ed by a hideous head lifted up, and 
more tentacles waved wildly, menac- 
ingly, as the creature glared baleful- 
ly at the surrounding Earthmen. 

Six snaky arms writhed from the 
black, repulsive body protected by an 
artificial shell of metal. The tentacle 
ends were tipped with metal sharp- 
ened to razor-edged cutting power. 
A head with an eye in front and an 
eye in back of the oval cranium 
turned' from side to side. The eyes 
stared intently, exuding a cold, crafty 
expression of intelligence. A blunt 
snout sniffed inquisitively. Several 
of the nearer Earthmen sprang to the 
aid of their stricken comrade, but it 
was too late. Three more tentacles 
curled themselves around the doomed 
man, cutting his body to pieces. 

“Get out of here — quick!” urged 
Mernoq. “We are powerless to com- 
bat them!” 

Down the corridors ambled five of 
the insidious creatures. More of 
them were emerging from the metal 
containers. The Earthmen raced to 
the comparative safety of the fire 
cavern. 

“What are they?” 

“The invaders!” exclaimed Mernoq. 
“The things that conquered the Solar 
System ages ago! We thought them 
all dead!” 

“Impossible!” deplored Reod. “How 
could they have lived?” 

“Suspended animation!” replied 
Mernoq, whose astute mind had con- 
ceived the truth of the situation. 
“When we opened that door it re- 
leased forces automatically which 
were necessary to bring them out of 
their sleep! Air machines were set 
to working, too! See! There is air 
down here, now!” 

l^/fi'ERNOQ pointed to the leaping 
flames which seethed outward 
from the pit, the blue-green lumin- 
osity changing in color as it yielded 
to red and white heat. A tremendous 
wave of hot air sent them scurrying 
backward, making them aware of its 
warmth even throughtheir space suits. 



“We are weaponless against them!” 
cried Uljoph. 

Mernoq realized this fact keenly. 
The space invaders were not only ar- 
mored but doubtlessly possessed 
weapons, too. Mernoq hurriedly led 
the way around the fire pit and into 
that black section of the cavern which 
lay ahead. He was hoping against 
hope. They must go that way and 
hope for a continuance of the tunnel. 
To return the way they had come 
would ultimately mean finding them- 
selves trapped. These thoughts flew 
swiftly among them. 

“What of the twenty men we left 
with the energy broadcaster?” Uljoph 
suggested. “Suppose they attack in 
that direction?” 

“The tunnel rises that way! The 
air will die out in the upper levels!” 

“But if their air machines generate 
more air?” 

The ominous question remained un- 
ansv>?ered as the Earthmen set out on 
a run past the fire pit, the increased 
heat of the flames driving them far 
to one side near the v/all. Mernoq’s 
apprehensions grew less as he saw 
ahead of them the continuation of the 
tunnel. He had begun to fear that the 
cavern marked the tunnel’s end. The 
Earthmen became weary after a mile 
or more of rapid running. 

It was the desire of Mernoq to put 
a goodly amount of distance between 
them and the hateful creatures of the 
fire cavern. The latter had suspend- 
ed themselves in a living death to 
bridge the ages with their menace. 



CHAPTER IV 
Subterranean Battle 



T O the satisfaction of the Earth- 
men, the tunnel struck a steep in- 
cline, much steeper than the one they 
had recently descended on leaving 
the kletin storerooms. In some places 
steps had been cut because of the ten- 
dency toward perpendicular ascent. 
The climb was a long one. Soon they 
found that the air manufactured be- 
low them was dying out. They were 
once more in the usual vacuum. The 



86 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



lower levels had been left behind. 

They came to a long flight of steps 
up which they climbed to find them- 
selves in another large cavern. All 
around them lay water. They were 
on an island in a subterranean lake. 
Their bright lights revealed shore lit- 
tle more than a hundred yards away. 
The island lay in nearly the exact 
center of the lake, several hundred 
feet from shore. It bore evidences of 
having been purposely constructed. 
The water, or fluid of the lake, which 
was closely akin to water, took on a 
peculiar appearance to the eyes of the 
Earthmen. It appeared dull and with- 
out lustre. This was due largely to 
a lack of atmosphere. 

“How can we cross?” queried Ul- 
joph. “We can hardly swim with our 
space suits.” 

“If the water is not too deep cr the 
bottom is not full of holes, we can 
walk across.” 

“If we could but drain the lake 
down through the passage, why — ” 

Reod’s original idea v/as lost in a 
brilliant burst of inspiration. His 
sudden enthusiasm was shared by the 
rest. 

“Drain the lake into the internal 
fires! Kill the monsters!” 

For a moment Mernoq felt himself 
overwhelmed by the possibilities of 
the daring plan. In his mind’s eye he 
saw the waters of the lake rushing 
down the long tunnel, filling the low- 
er level and cascading into the molten 
pit of fire. There would be boiling 
chaos, clouds of steam, the long dor- 
mant invaders scalded to death. His 
indecision was short. 

“Cut a channel!” 

The Earthmen set to work v^^ith a 
will, rapidly cutting a ditch from the 
lake to the orifice of the tunnel in the 
island’s center. Luckily they pos- 
sessed the rock picks which made up 
an essential part of their space suit 
equipment. Rapid headway was made, 
for the rock was a soft type peculiar 
to Venus. A large group started 
working from the tunnel entrance, 
while others worked up to their heads 
in water at the lake’s edge, their 
globed helmets rising out of the water 
only to disappear again. Mernoq sent 



one of his men to gauge the depth of 
the lake. The man walked out of 
sight, the water swirling above his 
head. From time to time he radiated 
reports to his comrades above. His 
space helmet finally broke the surface 
of the water near the farther shore 
where their lights had revealed a con- 
tinuance of the tunnel. The lake was 
comparatively shallow^. 

“We can all walk across,” said 
Mernoq. 

“When this water starts draining 
into the lower levels, we must hurry,” 
warned Reod. “Steam will be forced 
back this way.” 

“What of those we left in the cham- 
ber of the broadcaster?” Uljoph in- 
quired. “If the steam rises, they will 
die, too.” 

“The steam will seek the nearest 
and easiest exit,” said Mernoq. “Be- 
sides, remember the heavy stone 
blocking the entrance to the secret 
tunnel. It will resist tremendous 
steam pressure.” 

^^NE of the Earthmen made a star- 
fling discovery. “Air is blow- 
ing up the shaft! It is rising into 
this cavern!” 

It was true. A strong current of 
air blew up the tunnel, bringing a thin 
veil of dust with it. Mernoq feared 
the coming of the interstellar invad- 
ers. More atmosphere was being gen- 
erated from the corridors leading off 
from the fire cavern. 

“We must hurry!” 

Only a thin slice of rock separated 
the two channels which were nearly 
converged. The Earthmen chopped 
madly with their picks. They had 
worked frantically in shifts, only a 
fraction of their number being able to 
work unhampered in the ditch. A 
scout Mernoq had sent down the tun- 
nel now returned. 

“They are coming! They have 
weapons!” 

A trickle of water burst over the 
lip of the tunnel leading from the 
island to the lower levels. The alarm 
spurred the laboring Earthmen to des- 
perate measures in a superhuman ef- 
fort to send the lake rushing down 
the tunnel before their ancient ene- 



THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS

mies could emerge. Upon the rising 
current of air came a deathly cry 
which the radiophone ears of the 
space helmets readily picked up. It 
was eerie and chilling like no sound 
the Earthmen had ever before heard. 
One of the terrible things they had 
unwittingly revived strode into view 
below them on short, squat legs. In 
several of his long tentacles, he car- 
ried gleaming discs. 

The Earthmen stood at the top of 
the shaft with upraised picks, the 
only weapons they possessed. These 
were crude, indeed, compared to the 
destructive weapons which Aamon 
had carried away on the space ship. 
Two of the pale, disc beams fell on 
the nearer of the Earthmen, focusing 
for but a brief moment. A round por- 
tion of each space suit glowed red, 
then disappeared. Underneath, the 
flesh of the Earthmen shone a ruddy 
hue, iridescent sparks shedding 
themselves rapidlly. 

The unfortunate men fell dead 
while the discs of fire continued to 
burn completely through their bodies. 
The disc beams flicked upon others 
of the band. One of them staggered 
toward the water. Another sank to 
his knees beside the tunnel. 

“Back!” he cried. With all four 
arms, he brushed and struck madly at 
the glowing spot which ate through 
his space suit. “Don’t let them — ” 

He rose suddenly and jumped down 
upon the advancing monster in a des- 
pairing leap as he felt the death ray 
eating swiftly into his vitals. His 
impetuous leap hurled back the inter- 
stellar invader upon four or five more 
who came crowding up from behind. 
For a moment all was confusion in 
the tunnel. Metal-tipped tentacles 
hastened the death of the martyred 
man who had used his rapidly expir- 
ing body to the greatest advantage. 

Extricating themselves from the 
tangle of bodies and tentacles, the ter- 
rible creatures of the fire pit scuffled 
up the shaft, their disc rays waving 
wildly. A deluge of rushing water 
met them, hurling them backward. 
One survivor clung with his tentacles 
to the lip of the tunnel opening. With 
mighty strength he pulled himself out 



of the strong current. Fully a hun- 
dred picks hacked his tentacles as all 
four arms of the nearer Earthmen rose 
and fell. The dismembered body, de- 
void of anything with which to cling, 
yielded to the strong pull of the cur- 
rent. The shrieking head with its 
hateful, venomous eyes, disappeared 
beneath the cascading water, the hor- 
rid screeching muffled to a frantic 
gurgle. 

F or a moment the Earthmen 
seemed rooted to the spot. Sev- 
eral of their number lay dead, victims 
of the disc beams. Yet the Earthmen 
had triumphed. 

Reod shook his head ruefully. 

“I fear for those we left in the 
chamber of the energy broadcaster.” 
“We must get back to where the 
space ship landed,” said Mernoq. 
“Then we shall learn if they are safe.” 
Directions were quickly found, and 
they headed for the distant monolith 
which lay broken and wrecked be- 
cause of the treacherous attempt 
Aamon had made to send them all into 
eternity. Even now, unsuspecting hu- 
manity upon the Earth prepared for 
further contingents of the exodus 
while Aamon was laying his plans. 
The thought urged Mernoq to great- 
er haste. He had a plan in mind. 

It was not long before the jagged 
remnants of the great monolith be- 
came visible upon the horizon. The 
Earthmen hurried to the spot. Where 
the entrance to the subterranean 
chambers had been located was now 
but a tumbled mass of rock. Mernoq 
sent out a call to those they had left 
imprisoned in the kletin chambers 
with the energy broadcaster. It was 
answered. Their comrades were alive, 
and the mechanism was functioning 
perfectly. 

“How are we to communicate with 
Earth and w'arn them of Aamon’s 
treachery?” queried Reod. “We have 
no equipment.” 

“Do you realize what type of ex- 
plosive Aamon employed in destroy- 
ing the monolith?” 

“Why — yes. The explosive was an- 
nite. I recognized it when I heard the 
blast.” 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



The mind of Mernoq still, remained 
reservedly inscrutable. “Annite,” he 
continued, “is a queer explosive.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Its destructive forces are tremen- 
dous yet it has a peculiar fault when 
exploded in space or upon a planet 
which has no atmosphere.” 

“Why, yes, fragments of it are gen- 
erally blown off it and fail to ex- 
plode.” 

“Exactly. Mostly through a lack 
of barometric pressure.” 

“And what good will that do us?” 
asked Uljoph. 

“In one of these large rocks we are 
going to hollow out a crude form of 
rocket gun,” Mernoq explained. “We 
shall charge it with the fragments of 
unexploded annite which is strewn 
about here on the ground.” 

In a brief flash they recognized 
Mernoq’s purpose. They were going 
to rocket a warning to the Earth, hop- 
ing it would reach there in time to 
prevent the cataclysm which Aamon 
had planned. 



CHAPTER V 
Rocket Messages 

REPARATIONS were hastily 
made. With their picks, the 
Earthmen commenced fashioning a 
rocket gun in the side of a huge slab 
which faced away at the desired angle 
Mernoq wanted. For the construc- 
tion of the rocket itself, Mernoq 
searched among the ruins at the 
monolith’s base for metal stanchions 
which had previously been built into 
the entranceway. It was here that he 
made a discovery which he considered 
fortunate. 

“There is sufficient metal to build 
three rockets for dispatch to Earth 
if we can gather annite to power all 
three.” 

“Can we send a message without 
its destruction when the rocket 
crashes against Earth?” 

“Arrange parachutes to be released 
when the rockets hit Earth’s atmos- 
phere,” suggested Uljoph. 

“Or we may be able to fix reverse 



annite charges in various positions so 
that the increasing friction with 
Earth’s atmosphere will explode them 
and slow up the rocket’s speed.” 

By searching a large part of the vi- 
cinity where the explosion of annite 
had occurred, the Earthmen gathered 
enough fragments to send off and 
equip with reverse charges all three 
of the rockets. Mernoq and his sub- 
ordinate officers figured the mathe- 
matical position of the two planets 
and their movements quite carefully, 
also estimating the force of the an- 
nite. The rockets would hit their 
target. 

“It is a long chance, these rockets,” 
Uljoph said grimly. “What if none 




of them are found, or suppose they 
land in an ocean where tjfiey cannot 
be recovered?” 

“In that case,” said Mernoq, “it will 
mean the destruction of Earth’s at- 
mosphere and all human beings now 
on the planet.” 

“You think that Aamon has done 
his work and departed for Zyse?” 

“He has had time for it. Our only 
chance is to get word to them in time 
to charge the atmosphere with a coun- 
teracting gas.” 

“One of Earth’s telescopes may dis- 
cover our plight here,” suggested 
Reod. “Space ships may be sent.” 

“I have been thinking the same,” 
said Mernoq, “yet it is probable that 
Aamon has a ready story to tell, es- 
pecially in regard to the demolished 
monolith.” 

Each of the Earthmen measured 




THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS 



the possibilities and hoped the gages 
at the observatories on the Earth 
picked up the proximity and compo- 
sition of all foreign objects entering 
Earth’s atmosphere. Some of the 
rockets would be traced and found. 
The question of timely arrival, how- 
ever, v/as uppermost in their minds. 
In spite of the terrific power and ac- 
celerating impetus afforded by annite, 
it would be a long time before the 
projectiles reached Earth. 

A T Mernoq’s order, the Earthmen 
set off the first rocket. At long 
intervals the other two were sent into 
space. Off they hurtled in the direc- 
tion of the green-glowing planet 
which glowed steadily in the sky. 
Earth and Venus were nearly in line, 
and the sun’s position favored the 
Sight of the rockets. Time must pass, 
time which battled with the time 
Aamon had set for the destruction of 
civilization. The rockets not only 
contained messages relating to 
Aamon’s perfidy, but they also gave 
specific directions for charging the 
atmosphere. 

It was at Reod’s suggestion that an- 
other chance of salvation was made 
possible. Mernoq employed this at 
once. On a sloping wall facing the 
nlanet Earth, messages were written 
in gigantic characters on the chance 
that Earth telescopes might be trained 
that way. 

Time dragged for the waiting 
Earthmen. A close watch was kept 
upon the green star, for the Earthmen 
were fearful of the telltale flash sur- 
rounding the planet which would tell 
of Aamon’s success. 

The Earthmen knew that it would 
be a long time before the stellar mes- 
sages reached Earth, a great number 
of times longer than passage by space 
ship. 

Only a few days had passed when 
one of the Earthmen issued a mental 
cry of excitement which brought the 
general focus of attention immedi- 
ately upon the green, glowing planet 
v/hich swung far off in space. Mer- 
noq’s heart chilled with fear. Had the 
gigantic cataclysm been unloosed at 
last? His keen eyes searched for the 



telltale glare of destruction. Instead, 
he saw several bright specks growing 
larger in the sky. They expanded to 
view as they came, and he saw that 
they were space ships. 

Five in number, they cruised about 
the vicinity of the wrecked monolith, 
finally settling to rest. The stranded 
Earthmen watched in undecided an- 
ticipation. Was this help arriving, 
or had Aamon returned to finish the 
sinister work which had narrowly 
failed him the first time? Several 
figures stepped from the nearest ship 
and approached them. Mernoq, with 
gladness in his heart, recognized one 
of them as Eloow. 

“Earth’s atmosphere!’’ cried Mer- 
noq, voicing the apprehension upper- 
most in his mind. “Is it saved?’’ 
“We do not yet know for certain, 
but we hope for the best.’’ 

“How did you get here so soon? 
We sent rockets, but that was but a 
few days ago.’’ 

“We read your cliff message from 
our space ship,” said Eloow. “We 
were already on our way here.” 

“But Aamon — where is he?” 

“On his way to Zyse, but it is a 
small start he has. We left for Ve- 
nus secretly almost at the starting 
moment of Aamon’s ship in the direc- 
tion of Sirius. His course of flight 
has diverged only at a slight angle 
from our own. I was suspicious of 
him when he told how the monolith 
had been destroyed in blasting a nec- 
essary passage into the kletin cham- 
bers. He reported that you and the 
others not returned with him had de- 
cided to stay and move the kletin out 
upon the surface of Venus before 
more ships were sent for it.” 

•f^®THEN were these ships to 
wW come for us?” Mernoq asked. 
“Sixteen Earthly days hence.” 
“When Aamon’s destruction of 
Earth’s ai? was consummated and he 
was safely on his way out of the Solar 
System,” observed Mernoq. 

“And you were found entombed and 
dead,” added Eloow. “When our tele 
scope picked up the inscriptions you 
made on the cliff, I dispatched one of 
our ships back to Earth to take pre- 



90 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



yentative measures against Aamon’s 
.reachery.” 

“The formula for charging the air?” 
Mernoq interrogated eagerly. 

“The formula so long preserved and 
which is entrusted to but a ievf of us, 
you, Aamon and myself included. The 
same formula which our ancient an- 
cestors used in keeping the exploding 
emanations from Venus’ atmosphere 
harmless when they struck the atmos- 
phere of Earth.” 

“Then our fears are at rest, for 
Aamon would not have timed the ex- 
plosion to occur before he had left the 
Solar System, and you say that he has 
but a short start.” 

“That is so.” 

“Aamon must never reach Zyse,” 
Mernoq avovi^ed. 

“It is unlikely that he shall,” re- 
plied Eloow. “I have suspected him 
i'or a long time. I never placed the 
trust and confidence in him that you 
did. On one reason or another, I held 
up most of the ships which were to 
leave with Aamon, but I could not 
manage to delay Aamon himself. I 
did the next best thing. I placed a 
man aboard with orders to hamper 
the speed of his ship in case we 
wished to catch up.” 

“Let us give chase at once!” 

Mernoq hurried with Eloow to his 
ship. Four ships rose from the cold, 
dead surface of airless Venus and 
raced off into space. The remaining 
ship stayed while its occupants set to 
work releasing the score of impris- 
oned Earthmen attending the energy 
radiator. 

The course of Aamon's ship had led 
sunv/ard, designed on a straight 
course to Sirius which would cut close 
to the orbit of Mercury. Earthmen 
eagerly scanned the proximity detec- 
tors as high speed was attained. The 
four ships spread out so that they 
cruised several thousand miles apart. 
They were nearing Mercury’s orbit 
when the sunward ship of the group 
first picked up the location of 
Aamon’s slower-moving space ship. 
The four pursuing ships gradually 
converged. A message was radiated 
for Aamon to stop. His answer was 
a vicious blast of power which nar- 



rowly missed the nearest ship of 
Eloow’s fleet. 

Aamon put on a sudden spurt of 
speed. It was evident that Eloow’s 
minion who had been responsible for 
the slowing up of Aamon’s ship had 
been detected. That his end had been 
a swift one neither Eloow nor Mer- 
noq doubted. The four ships kept 
abreast of Aamon’s at a safe distance. 
Another blaze of power went wide of 
its mark. Still another and much 
closer charge caused one of the pur- 
suing ships to tumble crazily in space 
until it once more righted itself. 

“Shall we fire?” asked Eloow, turn- 
ing to Mernoq. 

Mernoq nodded grimly. The order 
was communicated to all four ships. 
Simultaneously blasts leaped out at 
the fleeing craft. Two of them struck. 
They waited to see the extent of the 
damage. 

AMON’S ship, demolished at one 
end, rolled awkwardly off its 
course, still hurtling at meteoric 
speed. Mernoq and Eloow watched 
the proximity detectors. A series of 
blasts from the space-wrecked craft 
lashed savagely and spitefully at its 
avengers. They were ineffectual yet 
revealed dangerous potentials which 
were still Aamon’s. 

“Another barrage will finish him.” 

Mernoq halted in the act of issuing 
instructions as Eloow gripped his 
arm and pointed significantly at the 
proximity detector. 

“Aamon has lost his propulsion 
power. He is falling into the sun. 
What end could be more fitting? We 
have only to stand by at a safe dis- 
tance and watch him go to a well- 
merited death.” 

Mernoq revised his orders to fire. 
Instead, his ships formed a funeral 
consort about the doomed and help- 
less ship of his arch-enemy whom 
once he had trusted and encouraged. 
They cruised too far distant *for 
Aamon to vent any further spite upon 
them, although he made several vain 
attempts. Nearer and nearer the 
great, flaming globe of the sun they 
raced, the initial momentum of 
Aamon’s ship, at the time he had been 



THE ASTOUNDING EXODUS 



91 



struck, swervingly diverted tovv'ard 
the sun’s incandescent mass. He had 
no power to change the course. The 
end was inexorable. 

So fast were the five ships moving 
through space that soon the ships of 
the fleet commenced to feel the tre- 
mendous drag of the sun’s immense 
attraction. Aamon’s fall was accel- 
erating. He and his faithless crew 
were consigned to a flaming hell 
which would consume them long be- 
fore they ever reached it. 

They were to die a horrible, linger- 
ing death of suffocating heat, watch- 
ing tormented ly the sunward side of 



their space ship grow red, then v/hite- 
hot, before they perished miserably. 
Something of this inevitable doom 
must have impressed itself on Aamon, 
for in the middle of the funeral cor- 
tege the cosmic coffin with its living 
and doomed cargo burst suddenly into 
a bright flash of light. 

Where a slow-moving dot had rest- 
ed on the proximity detectors there 
were now but a few, tiny specks slow- 
ly radiating from a central point. 
Aamon had chosen the easier way. 
No longer did he stand as a menace 
to mankind’s peace and security in 
the exodus to the new world.

Ross Sherili’s Superman of 
Future Eons Knows but 
One Master — 
Evolution! 

By EDMOND 
HAMILTON 



Author of "The Comet Doom" "The Ac- 
cursed Galaxy" etc. 



T he little rat-faced man looked 
fearfully at the mechanism in 
the corner of the lamp-lit labo- 
ratory. It was like a tall cylindrical 
cage of metal bars, connected elec- 
trically to the generators, huge 
vacuum tubes, and other apparatus in 
the room. 

He turned jerkily toward the other 
two people in the room. One was a 
serious, lanky young man, the other a 
girl whose soft face was pale and 
whose dark eyes held hooded appre- 
hension. These two were Ross Sherill, 
brilliant young biologist, and his wife, 
Gail. 

The ratlike little man asked fear- 
fully, “Is that the machine? The 
thing you’re going to use to — to 
change me?” 

“That’s it, Fraham,” said Ross She- 
rill steadily. “The projector that is 
going to throw you a million years 
ahead of the rest of the human race, 
in evolutionary development.” 

His serious eyes kindled with 
scientific enthusiasm as he addressed 
the wizened little Fraham, 

“Evolution is ordinarily a very slow 
process,” he went on, “a physical and 
mental change which I recently dis- 



“Do you think I want to be a half-ape^"

Severed is caused by certain kinds of 
cosmic radiation that effect slight 
changes in our bodies, forcing our 
race ever higher on the road of prog- 
ress. I’ve found out how to produce 
those forces artificially, many times 
stronger. So when I turn those vastly 
intensified forces on your body, you 
will in a few minutes pass through 
evolutionary changes that will take a 
million years for the rest of the race 
to pass through naturally.” 

“Yes, but what’ll I change into?” 
cried Fraham. “Suppose I change into 
something awful, what then?” 

"Once I’ve thrown you ahead in de- 
velopment and observed what the 
human race will evolve into, I can 
bring you back to your present 
status,” Sherill told him calmly. “I 
found a certain cosmic radiation that 
reverses evolutionary change, and I’ll 
use that on you.” 

The lanky young scientist took a 
packet of bills from his pocket. 

“Here’s the thousand dollars I 
agreed to give you for submitting to 
the experiment. You’ll get it when 
we’re done.” 

F raham stiffened at sight of the 
money, and an ugly gleam came 
into his slitted eyes. 

“I might add that you’ll get the 
money only by undergoing the experi- 
ment,” Sherill added pleasantly. “I 
have a pistol in my pocket and if you 
try an3Tthing, I’ll shoot. Well, what 
about it — are you willing to undergo 
the experiment?” 

Fraham’s face was beaded with 
perspiration, and his eyes rolled from 
the money to the bulky, enigmatic 
mechanism. 

He finally spoke, hoarsely. “I’ve got 
to do it, and you know it — you know 
the police are hot after me and that I 
need that grand to get out of the 
country. But remember,” he added 
desperately, “you promised to bring 
me back so I’ll be just like I am now!” 
“I will — you’ll be out of here in an 
hour,” Ross Sherill told him eagerly. 
“Step inside the projector.” 

As Fraham slowly obeyed, entering 
the cylindrical cage with steps 
weighted by dread, Gail Sherill laid a 



trembling hand on her husband’s arm. 
Her dark eyes held fear. “Ross,” she 
said, “I’m afraid of this experiment. 
I wish you’d give it up.” 

“Don’t bother me now, dear, please,” 
the tense young scientist begged. 

He was turning switches, shifting 
controls. The generators around the 
room broke into humming life, the 
great tubes silently lit to a violet 
glow, transformers sprayed a crack- 
ling brush. 

Sherill, his hand on the final switch, 
regarded the terrified little man inside 
the projector. 

“Just stand steady, Fraham,” he 
said. “It will take only fifteen min- 
utes of exposure to the force.” 

He flung the sv/itch. Brilliant white 
light broke from the vertical bars of 
the projector, a blinding cascade of 
radiation that hid from sight the 
trembling man inside. The evolution 
accelerating force was playing upon 
that man’s body, millions of times 
more powerful than such forces had 
ever played upon a human being be- 
fore. 

Ross Sherill watched tensely, his 
hand on the switch. Behind him, Gail 
watched too, her slim figure rigid 
with fear of the unknown. What was 
going on inside that glowdng halo? 
What tremendous changes were 
taking place in Fraham as the awful 
cosmic forces flung him through 
thousands of years of future develop- 
ment each minute? 

It was ghastly, unholy, the fear- 
ridden girl told herself, this artificial 
short-cut on the road of slow evolu- 
tion ! Her husband was violating the 
basic laws of the universe itself in 
thus hurling a human being a million 
years past his fellows in development. 
Why had she ever let him do it? 

Sherill counted the minutes be- 
neath his breath. “Fourteen — 
fifteen!” He threw the switch open. 

The blinding glow of radiation died, 
and they stared, petrified, at the man 
inside the cylindrical cage. The 
wizened, rat-faced little criminal had 
vanished and in his place stood a man 
of superhuman, terrible aspect. 

His huge form was bursting from 
Fraham’s clothes. For this man was 



94 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



almost seven feet tall, with colossal 
shoulders tapering down into a lean, 
perfect body of tremendous strength. 
A body that was as much superior to 
the ordinary human form as man is to 
the ape. 

But the face! It was godlike in 
terrible beauty, the features perfectly 
regular, the mouth a straight, merci- 
less line, the eyes enormous glowing 
ones through which looked a cold, 
vast mind whose shock was felt 
tangibly. The head was quite hairless. 

“My God!” cried Ross Sherill, star- 
ing in amazement at this superhuman 
figure. “Fraham, changed — ” 

“Ross, change him back!” cried 
Gail, clutching her husband’s arm in 
terror. “I’m afraid!” 

Too late for that! Fraham, or the 
godlike man who had been Fraham, 
was stepping out of the projector. 
His glowing eyes fastened on Sherill 
and the dazed young scientist felt 
those eyes reading the depths of his 
mind like an open book. That inhuman 
gaze swung to Gail’s pale face, and 
she flinched in horror from it. 

T hen the transformed Fraham’s 
coldly beautiful face turned back 
to Sherill. He spoke in an icy, level 
voice. 

“To think it was you, a savage semi- 
animal, who developed me!" 

“Fraham!” said Ross Sherill 
hoarsely. “You did change — into the 
kind of man all men will be in a mil- 
lion years.” 

He went on with desperate hope. 
“All right, now that I’ve seen what 
the course of future evolution will 
bring forth. I’ll bring you back to 
your former state. Step back into the 
projector.” 

The creature before them laughed! 
A cold, terrifying and mirthless 
laughter. 

“You amuse me,” he told Sherill. 
“Do you think that I would let you 
change me back now into what I was, 
into a dim-minded, shriveled half-ape 
like yourself? No, I stay as I am. and 
with my brain I can bring all your 
witless race under my rule, easily.” 
“Ross,” Gail cried desperately to 
her husband, “he’ll do it if you let him 



stay like this. You must change hinJ 
back!” 

Ross Sherill suddenly produced the 
pistol in his pocket and levelled it at 
the godlike Fraham’s heart. 

“Back into the projector, Fraham, 
or I’ll shoot!” he cried. “I don’t in- 
tend to let my experiment release a 
super-minded monster on the world.” 

The superman before him laughed 
again. 

“You think to match wills with me? 
Throw that weapon out of tha 
window.” 

His glowing eyes were riveted on 
Ross Sherill’s as he uttered the com- 
mand. As those supernal eyes bored 
into his soul, the young biologist felt 
himself losing control of his own 
body. 

He tried to pull the trigger and 
couldn’t. His muscles were obeying, 
not his own mind, but the hypnotic 
command of the creature before him. 
Resistless, his hand went up, and 
flung the pistol out of the open 
window. 

Fraham went on contemptuously in 
that eerie, cold voice. 

“You begin to see how helpless you 
are to resist me. Just as helpless will 
all men be, when I appear in their 
cities and order them to submit to ray 
rule.” 

His glowing eyes flashed. “I may 
have to destroy many of them before 
they learn my power. But it will be 
easy. My mind can devise weapons 
against which your race will be 
powerless to resist. I will build the 
first of those weapons now!” 

As Sherill and his wife watched, 
the superman moved swiftly about the 
laboratory, picking up some ebonite 
rods, two copper discs, a small piece 
of bismuth and other odd objects. 

They saw the transformed Fraham 
deftly, quickly, join these things to- 
gether into a tripodlike instrument, 
crowned by the two discs. Ross 
Sherill realized in horror that it was 
some awful weapon of the future de- 
signed to be used upon present 
day humanity. The lanky young, 
scientist crouched, leaped for Fra- 
ham’s throat! 

Fraham whirled, and the hypnotic 



A MILLION YEARS AHEAD 



95 



command of those terrible eyes froze 
Sherill halfway across the room. 

“You will remain in this room, you 
two,” commanded the superman, 
“while I test my new weapon outside. 
I can use you — as subjects to test 
other weapons upon.” 

Without another look at them he 
strode out of the room with his 
curious weapon. Looking numbly out 
through tha window into the moon- 
light, they could see his huge figure 
striding up the slope of the hill be- 
hind the old country house. 

They saw him stop up there on the 
crest, where he seemed to be setting 
up and adjusting the tripodlike thing. 

Ross Sherill threw himself toward 
the door. 

“I’ll get the pistol I threw outside!” 
he cried to his wife. “That monster’s 
got to be killed at once or he’ll de- 
stroy the world.” 

He reached the door — and stopped. 
He could go no further; his muscles 
were obeying the hypnotic command 
of the superhuman Fraham, and not 
his own will. Sherill concentrated 
strongly, but could not get through 
that door. Neither could Gail, when 
she tried. 

“Ross, we can’t get out!” she 
sobbed. “We — ” 

“We’ve got to!” cried the young 
scientist wildly. “If we don’t. I’ll be 
responsible for the havoc that crea- 
ture will wreak on Earth.” Then he 
pointed through the window and 
cried, “Look, he’s trying that devilish 
weapon now!” 

Up there on the crest of the moon- 
lit hill they could see the huge figure 
of the superhuman Fraham bending 
over his tripod instrument. They 
glimpsed a swift, terrific flash of white 
fire or force that drove out into the 
moonlight from the thing. 

They saw the monstrous superman 
straighten and peer into the silver 
night as though to see the effect of 
that tremendous bolt as it struck 
somewhere far away. 

ffW^E can’t stop him!” Gail was 
exclaiming, her eyes wide 
with dazing horror. “We’re like 
children against a brain like that, un- 



able to oppose our minds for a minute 
against his.” 

Like a bomb exploding in his brain, 
an idea burst blindingly upon Ross 
Sherill. 

“We can’t oppose his mind now, 
no,” he cried, “but what if I throw 
myself forward a million years in de- 
velopment with the projector, also? 
Then I’d have a mind as vast and 
powerful as his — I could fight him!” 

He leaped instantly toward the 
cylindrical cage. 

“I’m going to do it; Gail! It will 
only take fifteen minutes for the force 
to throw me ahead, and I don’t think 
he’ll return before then.” 

Gail clung to his arm, crying. “No, 
Ross, don’t!” she pleaded. “You’ll 
become a monster like him.” 

“I won’t!” Sherill told her des- 
perately. “Fraham was of a predatory, 
criminal cast of mind, and that is why 
even after he had developed so tre- 
mendously, he still had in mind only 
the desire to dominate and prey on 
the world. But I want only to destroy 
the nienace of Fraham, and when I’ve 
done so I’ll re-enter the projector and 
you can use the reversing force to 
bring me back.” 

Before the terrified girl could pro- 
test further, he had entered the 
mechanism. 

“Throw the switch, Gail!” he com- 
manded urgently. “There’s little 
time.” 

The girl’s hand numbly closed the 
switch. Inside the cage of bars, Ross 
Sherill was almost blinded by the 
terrific burst of glowing force from 
about him. As that awful flood of 
tingling force saturated every atom in 
him, he felt hurled through abysses 
incredible, fathomless and staggering. 
He felt his mind and body changing, 
expanding, unfolding, with each pass- 
ing minute. 

Vast new vistas of thought opened 
out in his mind, things that had be- 
fore seemed complex and obscure 
became crystal clear to him. He felt 
a superhuman enhancement of his 
powers of reason. He knew he could 
solve problems in a moment that 
wculd take an ordinary man months 
or years. And as his body changed 



96 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



and grew, he felt a boundless physical 
vigor he had never felt before. 

His emotions were withering and 
dwindling, and a cold logic was now 
dominant in his mind. He was be- 
coming, he knew, the kind of man all 
men would become in a million years. 
And it seemed to him now that in 
changing from his former cramped 
body and mind, he was stepping from 
an animal state into one of full hu- 
manity. 

The glow of force died about him as 
the switch was opened, and he could 
look out now into the laboratory. 
Before him, staring wildly at him, was 
a girl. He felt a repulsion at sight of 
her. This savage, semi-ape, female 
thing, so undeveloped of mind and 
body, had he really loved this? His 
new mind sickened at the thought. 

She was running toward him, cry- 
ing, “Ross — ” 

Then she stopped, and he saw 
horror and fear deepen in her eyes as 
she met his own gaze. 

“You’re not Ross at all,” she whis- 
pered. “You’ve changed, like Fraham. 
I’m afraid of you!” 

She was shrinking back from him 
in dread. But he paid no attention to 
her, as he strode out of the cage. 
Fraham — the other! The enemy 
whom he must destroy! 

His super-sensitive ears could 
already hear Fraham coming down 
the hill, returning to the house. But 
he did not fear the other now — he 
knev/ with cold confidence that he 
was his match. 

The haggard, wild-eyed girl also 
heard now and cried a warning. “Ross, 
he’s coming! Go out and get the pistol 
if you can—” 

“Be silent!” he ordered her. 

As her eyes met his commanding 
gaze she was mute and stricken. In 
his new mind, Sherill felt only con- 
tempt for her ignorant babbling. As 
though he needed a primitive toy like 
that pistol ! 

Fraham stepped into the door, a 
huge figure, as tall and superhuman as 
himself. And Fraham’s glov/ing eyes 
saw him and realized in an instant 
what had happened. 

“You — you’ve changed too!” he 



cried. “Well, we’ll see who’s master!’* 
He swung up the deadly tripodal 
weapon he carried. The woman 
screamed. 

“Drop that weapon,” Ross ordered 
calmly. 

H IS eyes were meeting Fraham’s, 
glowing gaze beating against 
glowing gaze, a contest of two super- 
minds more deadly than the clash of 
swords. Fraham was still raising his 
weapon but more slowly now. Slower 
and slower his hands moved as upon 
his brain beat the super-hypnotic 
command to desist. 

Then Fraham’s hands stopped, 
stiffly holding the tripod. He was 
putting every bit of his own brain’s 
colossal power into the hypnotic gaze 
with which he was battling the com- 
manding eyes of the transformed 
Ross Sherill. 

The two supermen stood silent, in 
the room that was utterly still except 
for the spasmodic sobs of the crouch- 
ing girl. They were engaged in a ter- 
rific battle of minds such as Earth had 
never held before. 

Then almost imperceptibly, the ter- 
rible eyes of Fraham wavered the 
merest trifle. His mind, before it had 
been projected a million years ahead 
in development, had been inferior to 
the scientist’s. And now that Sherill’s 
development also had been jumped 
forward ten thousand centuries, his 
mind was still inferior, was slowly 
breaking down before the scientist’s 
will. 

Slowly the hands of Fraham low- 
ered. In his eyes was an awful agony 
of searing hate and fury. Yet he could 
not keep his mental defenses from 
crumbling before the other’s assault. 

“Drop the weapon,” repeated Ross 
Sherill coldly, his godlike face un- 
changed in calm, 

Fraham’s fingers relaxed, and the 
diabolical tripod-weapon rattled to 
the floor. 

“Step into the projector,” ordered 
the transformed scientist, his gaze 
never flickering. 

As he understood the meaning of 
that command, Fraham’s eyes became 
terrible. Hellfires of furious revolt 



A MILLION YEARS AHEAD 



97 



flamed in them, a surge of terrific 
mental resistance. 

But Sherill’s commanding gaze held 
steady, beating the other down again 
with hypnotic command. A hoarse, 
strangled sound bursting from his 
lips, the huge figure of Fraham moved 
stiffly across the laboratory and into 
the tall cage of the projector. 

Sherill, still holding the other with 
his eyes, followed. His hand found 
the switch of the evolution reversing 
force and snapped it shut. Blue radia- 
tion burgeoned from the bars, wrap- 
ping Fraham’s great form in a shroud 
of azure light. 

Ross Sherill watched, immobile, as 
the projector hummed for minute 
after minute. The crouching girl was 
staring, stunned, at the cold awesome 
beauty of his inhuman face. 

Then Sherill flung open the switch. 
The blue force ceased. And there in 
the projector stood Fraham — not the 
transformed, mighty superman, but 
the wizened, rat-faced little criminal. 

He staggered out, dazedly, wildly. 

“I — I — ” he faltered, and sank into 
a dead faint on the floor. 

Sherill felt a touch on his sleeve. It 
was the girl, that savage, atavistic 
female thing, looking up into his 
face. 

“Ross, you conquered him — you 
brought him back and kept him from 
destroying the world!” she cried. 
“Now enter the projector yourself. 
Let me bring you back to the man you 
were, my husband.” 

Bring him back? Drag him back 
across a million years of development 
to become a semi-ape like herself, to 
become again cramped of mind and 
body, an unclean primitive animal? 

No, every thought in Sherill’s brain 
revolted at the idea. He wouldn’t give 
up this tremendous power of brain 
and body, this super-manhood he’d 
attained. He couldn’t! 

The girl seemed to read his 
thoughts. 

“You promised, Ross,” she pleaded. 

He shook her off coldly. What had 
he to do with this savage creature? 
Outside lay a world that only his 
great brain could put in order, a world 
waiting for him to be its master. 



T here was much for him to do in 
that world, a race to be forced 
into new, cleaner ways of living, war 
and greed and trickery to be stamped 
out. He could do all that — 

“Ross!” 

Somehow that cry of heartbreak 
made him stop at the door. Something 
in his inmost fibers, something still 
strangely bound to this savage crea- 
ture, was stopped and held by it. 

“Ross, it’s Gail — Gail !” she was cry- 
ing to him. “You must enter the pro- 
jector — for me.” 

His relentlessly clear mind told him 
that this woman was seeking to drag 
him back into a state of savagery like 
her own, to take away forever his 
wonderful mind and body. 

Yet something deep within him, 
something not to be controlled even 
by all his tremendous mental power, 
made him move, slow step by step, to- 
ward the cylindrical cage. At its very 
edge he hesitated, feeling stronger 
than ever that sick repulsion at the 
thought of returning to a half-animal 
state. 

“Please, Ross!” 

He stepped, very slowly, inside the 
cage of bars. With a choking sob, the 
girl threw shut the switch. 

When the blue reversing force 
stopped, it was Ross Sherill — not the 
transformed, godlike figure of before 
but again the lanky young scientist — 
who stepped out of the projector. 

He looked bewilderedly from the 
unconscious figure of Fraham, on the 
floor, to the girl who was running 
madly toward him. 

“Ross, you’ve come back !” she cried. 
Sherill’s face was aghast. 

“Why, I remember now — I didn’t 
want to come back to you, Gail !” he 
said. “You looked like an animal to 
me, looked repulsive, apelike — ” 

He held her tight. 

“God, what an awful thing that pro- 
jector almost released on the world,” 
he whispered. “I’m going to destroy 
it, and never build another. Whatever 
power has decreed the slow rate of 
human evolution knows better than 
we men — knows that if we tried to go 
too fast upon that evolutionary road, 
we would only destroy ourselves.”

CHAPTER I 
The Flower Box 

I N the fourth sector of the North 
Atlantic Airway, the westbound 
night plane with mail and fifty 
passengers was in trouble. A fuel 
leak had been discovered. 

“We’ll drop down on Pontoon 
Four,” the chief pilot said. “Won’t 
delay us much.” 

“Queer,” the radio man said, “I 
can’t get a word out of Somers and 
Alden.” 

Pontoon 4 lay glistening in the 
moonlight. A little emergency land- 
ing field, fifty by a hundred and fifty 
feet. A metal raft, raised on its pon- 
toons, alone here in the Atlantic. The 
moonlight gleamed on its flat metal 
expanse. 

At one end was a small metal shed 
—the supply house. At the other, 



close against the low-railed side of 
the raft, stood the little cottage where 
the pontoon-keepers lived. There 
were two of them — two young Amer- 
icans : Roy Somers and George Alden. 

The cottage was a single-story 
structure entirely of metal — silver- 
glistening alumite. This night of 
June 20th, 1945, was calm. The sea 
was placid. The officers and passen- 
gers of the distressed air-liner gazed 
down at the somnolent empty pon- 
toon. Its beacon lights were burning. 
The windows of the little cottage 
glowed with yellow illumination 
from within. 

But where were Roy Somers and 
George Alden? They should have an- 
swered the radio call. 

“Very queer,” the radio man said. 
“There ought to be more than Somers 
and Alden here. Only an hour ago 
I had a message from the eastbound 



Inside a Tiny Flower Box^ Somers and 



98 




plane. It stopped here. Put off two 
passengers — relatives of Alden.” 

An hour ago, nothing had been 
wrong here. The London-bound flyer 
had brought old Professor Alden and 
his daughter Anne from New York. 
They were George Alden’s father and 
sister who were to spend a few days 
on the pontoon visiting him. And the 
chief pilot of that other plane had re- 
ported something else. 



Was it a reptile from the prehistoric ages 
— a serpent hundreds of feet long? 

Shortly after leaving the pontoon, 
a passenger was found to be miss- 
ing One Jose Toro, who had come 
aboard at New York. He was booked 
through to London — but evidently he 
had left the ship at the pontoon. 

Very strange. Five people unac- 
counted for. The pilots searched the 
pontoon. They got their fuel from 
the storehouse. There was no sign 
of disorder. Nothing wrong. They 
searched the little metal cottage. Its 
door had a smashed lock. Nothing 
else was wrong. The few small in- 
terior rooms showed no signs of vio- 
lence. The luggage of Professor Al- 
den and his daughter stood as mute 
evidence that the guests had arrived. 

The officers of the mail plane re- 
ported the condition of Pontoon 4 
by radio to New York and to London; 
and in ten minutes, they departed. 



Perilous 



Manhunt!

THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



When they were gone, Pontoon 4 
still lay silent and deserted. Drama 
had been here — tragedy doubtless — 
but it was over now. 

But was it? On the floor of the 
kitchen, under the low southern win- 
dow, stood a little flower box. It was 
a box only a foot wide, two feet long, 
and hardly six inches deep. Soil was 
in it. A geranium flowered at its cen- 
ter. It seemed to have been neglected. 
Was only recently watered. 

Nothing of tragedy and drama go- 
ing on here now? No sign of life 
here on this deserted metal raft? Here 
in the flower box a little sign of life 
showed: an ant, in one corner, wan- 
dered disconsolately over the dirt, 
looking for food. But what of that? 
Anyone, here now staring at the little 
flower box, would have concluded that 
there was nothing to see! 

Fatuous reasoning! Who ever 
thinks of the amazing realms of small- 
ness always under our eyes, teeming 
always with drama and tragedy? 

This little flower box, for in- 
stance, . . . 

N hour and a half before the dis- 
tressed westbound flyer landed 
at Pontoon 4 and found it deserted, 
Roy Somers sat with George Alden in 
the kitchen of their metal house. Al- 
den had just come from his radio in- 
strument in the adjoining room. 

“The eastbound plane is landing 
here,” Alden said. “Roy, what do you 
think — father and Anne coming to 
spend a day or two!” His face was 
flushed, his dark eyes sparkled. 

The big blond-haired Somers was 
excited. “Good Lord, what news! 
Your father and Anne — ” 

Somers could think only of Anne. 
Coming here now. Anne, who through 
all the lonely days and nights was so 
constantly in his thoughts. 

“In ten or fifteen minutes,” Alden 
said. “What a surprise! Get busy, 
Roy — got to get this place slicked 
up.” 

The plane from New York landed 
swiftly, discharged Professor Alden 
and Anne; and quickly departed. To 
Somers it was like a dream, having 
Anne here. 



He clung to her hands. A smal!, 
slim, dark-haired girl; her face, like 
his, was flushed. 

“Roy — you’re hurting my hands — ” 

He released her hands in confu- 
sion, and turned to her father. Pro- 
fessor Alden was a small, frail, grey- 
haired man in his sixties — thin and 
wiry, like his son George. Somers 
picked up the suitcases ; but there was 
one small satchel which the professor 
insisted on carrying himself. 

“I’ll tell you about it later,” he said. 
“A discovery of mine.” 

Anne began cooking supper. The 
professor and his son crossed the raft 
to inspect the supply house. Somers 
joined them. But after a minute or 
two, he wanted to be back with Anne. 
He left them unceremoniously, re- 
crossed the metal field in the moon- 
light and approached the little metal 
cottage. 

The door was closed. Strange. He 
had left it open just a few moments 
before. Then he was stricken by the 
sound of a voice. Not Anne’s voice. 

“And I am here. I want to be with 
you.” 

The voice of Jose Toro. Somers 
recognized its suave, Spanish accent. 
He had met this Toro. A young 
Latin- American chemist who, in New 
York, was Professor Alden’s assist- 
a!it. Somers had never liked him. For 
one thing, he was far too attentive to 
Anne. 

“But, Jose, I thought you were on 
the plane — going on to London — ” 

“But 1 got off. There is some- 
thing — ” 

A sudden jealousy had made Som- 
ers pause by the door. There was a 
small hallway inside, beyond which 
was the kitchen. Anne and Toro evi- 
dently were there. The voices were 
muffled by the closed metal door, but 
still they were plainly audible. 

“Jose — ” The girl obviously was 
startled. “Jose — let me go!” 

Anne was almost screaming with 
terror. The house had several win- 
dows, all of which were open. Somers 
leaped for one of them. The heavy 
metal hurricane blind came snapping 
down in his face. And all the others 
slid closed simultaneously — all of 




ELIXIR OF DOOM

them electrically operated from a 
switch inside the house. 

And there was Toro’s muffled voice: 
“Stop fighting, you little fool! Dios! 
I do not want to hurt you — ’’ 

Back at the door, Somers frantically 
pounded, lunging against it; but it 
resisted all his efforts. And the metal 
window blinds v/ere the same. The 
little house was impregnable. 

Mingled with Anne’s screams of 
protest, again came Toro’s voice: 
“Adventure for you and me, eh, 
ninta? No one can catch us now!’’ 

To the raging Somers the voice 
seemed to have a new quality. Softer. 
Dimmer. 

Behind Somers, young Alden and 
the professor came dashing up, breath- 
less. 

“That fellow Toro,” Somers gasped. 
“Here — inside here, with Anne — ” 
The voices inside were steadily grow- 
ing fainter. “Get a crowbar, George! 
We’ll break the door — ” 

It seemed an eternity while they 
waited, and Somers raged and plunged 
at the resisting door. Then, within a 
minute, young Alden came rushing 
back with the heavy iron bar. 

The voices inside were very much 
dimmer now — queerly far away in 
sound. But they could not escape 
from the sealed metal house. Somers 
thought that, triumphantly, as he 
seized the crowbar and bashed in the 
door lock with a single blow. 

They rushed inside. It seemed to 
Somers that just then he heard Anne’s 
faint terrified cries. But the place 
was empty! 

Somers dashed through the rooms. 
“Anne,” he called, “where are you?” 
He dashed from one little room to 
the other. Searching frantically, 

The sealed house was empty! 

I N the kitchen, the trembling Pro- 
fessor Alden straightened from 
the floor. His small satchel was in his 
hand. He set it on the table. It was 
open. Somers saw rows of tiny metal 
vials, some red, some white. 

“He has stolen some of my drugs — 
my great discovery — ” the professor 
said, 

Somers and Alden stood gasping. 



listening. Amazing, diabolical plot of 
this Jose Toro. Amazing thing of sci- 
ence, this which now the professor 
was so vehemently telling. 

As the professor’s assistant, Toro 
had helped for the past two years in 
the old man’s chemical researches. 
Revolutionary research, successfully 
ending with an amazing discovery. A 
drug to shrink every tiny atom of the 
human body cells. To reduce in size 
every atom of any living organism. 
Uniform dwindling, so that the shape, 
the identity of the complex cell ag- 
glomerations remained unchanged— 
and only the bulk was altered. 

The professor gasped out his as- 
tounding secret as with trembling fin- 
gers he searched his satchel of vials. 
A drug for reducing the mass of a 
living organism. And a drug which 
was its opposite : to increase the mass 
— increase the bulk. 

Incredible thing. Somers stood con- 
fused. Incredible? Yet it explained 
this disappearance of Anne and Toro. 
Incredible fantasy? Yet here it was! 
Somers’ mind tried to encompass it. 
Anne and the villainous Toro had 
been here, but now they were gone! 

“But they’re not gone!” Professor 
Alden was saying. “They’re right 
here, of course. Gone from us, in size 
— but right here — somewhere. We’ll 
have to take the drug. Make our- 
selves small — find them — somewhere 
here — ” The professor’s hands shook 
as he gripped his little vials, “Roy — 
George, that’s what Anne and I came 
to tell you. I thought we might make 
an experiment here. I’ve never yet 
tried this with a human. Only with 
insects — ” 

He held one of the red, and one of 
the white vials. “The red — for dwin- 
dling. We must hurry. They’ll be 
gone so far into smallness — ” 

He suddenly checked himself. 
Somers saw an expression of horror 
sweep his face. On the floor there 
was a sound of scratching. The rasp 
and scuttling of insect feet, unnat- 
urally loud. 

For an instant the three men stood 
chilled with horror. They saw the 
thing now — an oblong black thing 
down on the floor of the room, over 



102 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



by the window. The bright light from 
the overhead electric bulb illumined 
it clearly. 

An ant, six inches ong! It stood 
belligerent on its bent legs. 

The professor’s voice broke the 
tense silence. “He — Toro — must have 
dropped a pellet of the enlarging 
drug! This ant — licking at it — don’t 
you realize?” 

It seemed to Somers that his heart 
stopped beating. The ant was visibly 
enlarging, swifter always, as though 
every moment its rate of growth was 
accelerating. Its multiple eyes glared. 
It reared erect. 

“Roy! Kill it!” The old professor 
was terrified into a panic of confusion. 

The thing eluded them. Long, glis- 
tening, black shape, pinched in the 
middle like an hour-glass. It disap- 
peared through the broken outer door 
— out to the moonlit expanse of the 
pontoon. 

“Roy — ^my God, Roy — George!” 

Somers and young Alden leaped 
past the white-faced old man. At the 
outer doorway all three paused. The 
professor gasped. 

“We’ve got to kill it! Can’t let it 
swim away — escape — It will devas- 
tate the v/orld!” 

Out in the moonlight, near the cen- 
ter of the glistening metal landing 
field, the hideous thing stood poised. 
Only an ant ! Somers stood with cold 
horror clutching at his heart. The 
damnable thing was growing 
larger. . . , What would its size in 
an hour be? Swimming the ocean — 
reaching shore. A monster, with no 
limit to its growth — perhaps. . . . 

Again the ant reared itself erect. 
Its eyes glowed phosphorescent in 
the moonlight. And then it dropped 
horizontally. Belligerent with the 
realization of its size, it came scut- 
tling forward! 



CHAPTER II 
The Fight with the Ant 



T O Somers, the brief terrifying 
combat was a fantasy of horror. 
He was aware of the hideous thing 



advancing. Enormous insect now. It 
advanced, lusting to seize these up- 
right enemies who stood regarding it. 

Somers heard the professor give a 
terrified cry and dart sideward. But 
young Alden jumped forward. The 
ant reared to meet him. They 
grappled; and Alden toppled back- 
ward; fell, with the ant down upon 
him. 

Somers reached for the heavy iron 
crowbar wdth which he had bashed in 
the cottage door. He seized it; leaped 
forward just as young Alden fell. 

And Somers swung the iron bar. 
It struck the huge black-shelled body. 
There v/as a sickening, mashing 
crack, a noisome stench of sticky 
white ooze. The back of the giant 
ant was broken; its pinched middle 
sagged; its whole mangled length 
writhed. 

With his senses reeling, Somers 
stooped and jerked the fallen young 
Alden away. 

The insect lay writhing as t'nough 
in a death agony. Young Alden had 
rolled away and was climbing to his 
feet. Somers had dropped the iron 
bar. He turned and picked it up to 
strike again. 

Too late! Amazing strength of this 
ant — strongest living thing of its 
size in all the v/orld! It reared its 
mashed and mangled body. It seemed 
gigantically to leap with its broken 
legs. Somers’ head reeled; he was 
barely aware of what was happening. 
He saw Professor Alden standing 
nearby — the huge, mangled insect 
leaping upon the old man — seizing 
him — bearing him away! 

Somers and young Alden all at once 
found themselves futilely, despairing- 
ly in pursuit. The giant ant held the 
old man’s body’s aloft, and with it, 
scuttled and lurched across the moon- 
lit metal surface. The professor 
screamed — a brief scream of agony. 

Somers flung the bar. It struck the 
ant; mashed it again. Doubtless now 
the thing was dying, or dead. But 
the momentum of its huge body and 
the blow of the bar slid it forward. 
The low guard rail of the pontoon 
was near at hand. 

The noisome, gigantic mass of shell 



ELIXIR OF DOOM 



lOS 




Five hundred feet above, Somers heaved the boulder down full at Toro’s head 



and puip, still gripping its victim, slid 
and crashed through the guard rail; 
vanished over the edge. There was 
a drop of thirty feet to the placid 
moonlit sea. A silent interval of hor- 
ror; then one final splash. 

“Tough, George!” Somers mur- 
mured. “He’s done for. We’ve for- 
gotten Anne — Got to do something!” 

They turned and ran. To Somers 
came the irrational thought that now, 
in the kitchen, they would seize this 
damnable Jose Toro. . . . But sight 
of the empty room brought Somers to 
his senses. How could he seize Toro, 
and rescue Anne? Yet they were 



here, som.ewhere. Frantically, he and 
Alden poked about the little room. 

But there was nothing to see; and 
only silence responded to their fran- 
tic calls. Silence — and the tramp of 
their own footsteps; the grind as they 
shifted chairs and tables, and the 
faint lap of the calm ocean against the 
walls of the pontoon. 

A sudden thought struck Somers 
which turned him cold with horror. 
He gripped his companion. 

“My God, George — we can’t do 
this! We’ll trample them if they’re 
here — small — under our feet — ” 

They stood transfixed, almost afraid 



104 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



to move. Somers tried to reason what 
must have happened. 

This Jose Toro, with his unwelcome 
attentions to Anne . . . Toro had 
known Professor Alden’s secret of the 
drugs. Toro had left the plane, hid- 
den himself on the pontoon. Watch- 
ing his chance, he had got into the 
house, stolen the drugs and the girl 
— taken her into the realm of small- 
ness. 

But where were they now? What 
part of the room? Alden was trem- 
blingly opening the satchel of drugs. 

“Two vials missing — it looks like 
that,” he said. “These others — red 
and v/hite — father said the red ones 
for smallness, didn’t he?” 

Somers remembered it. Each 
seized two of the vials. Alden locked 
the satchel again. Somers opened his 
small red bottle. A score of tiny red 
pellets were inside. But how many 
were they to take? 

T hey could only guess. One per- 
haps, for normal shrinkage. They 
decided to take only one each, at first. 
And add others later. 

But as they became small, in which 
part of the kitchen would they 
search? Somers’ mind tried to en- 
visage the coming experience, and it 
set him gasping. Why, to a human, 
tiny in size, this kitchen would be ex- 
panded into a gigantic realm. One 
might run across the floor, and be 
minutes reaching the opposite wall. 
Minutes? V/hy, if one were small 
enough, it might be a day’s journey! 

A vast realm of smallness here, with 
Toro and Anne wandering in it! 

Then Somers thought of something 
else. Toro must have dropped a pel- 
let of the enlarging drug. That ant 
had eaten some of it. . . . The ant — 
what was an ant doing in this metal 
kitchen — on the metal pontoon in the 
middle of the Atlantic? 

The little flower box! 

Somers cried, “I know where they 
may have gone — ” 

Alden knelt with him on the floor, 
beside the flower box The overhead 
light shone strong upon it. “Look, 
Roy! Look!” Alden murmured. 
Amazing sight! Down there, on the 



caked dirt, half hidden by the tiny 
fuzz of growth, two little figures were 
plainly visible. Toro — and Anne! He 
was carrying her inert body in his 
arms! 

Tiny human figures. A quarter of 
an inch high — no more! Toro carry- 
ing Anne. Struggling laboriously 
through the growth of grass blades. 

Dwindling figures! Already they 
were smaller than a moment before. 
The grass, far taller than Toro’s head, 
almost hid them. A vague instinct 
made Somers reach down. But he 
checked himself.- Powerless! How 
could he seize that tiny human form, 
no bigger than an ant? His descend- 
ing hand suddenly seemed monstrous; 
his thumb and forefinger were in- 
capable of grasping the minute 
figures. 

Breathlessly he and Alden crouched, 
stared down. Toro’s threading ad- 
vance had moved the grass blades, but 
now he was too small for that. He 
staggered with Anne’s body, moving 
between the blades without touching 
them. Was Anne dead? Somers 
could not think so, for the fleeing 
Toro then would have abandoned her. 
She had fainted, probably. 

Then he knew that Anne was not 
dead. The drugs were effective on 
living organisms only — and Anne’s 
body now was dwindling equally with 
her captor’s. Toro came out of the 
grass. So small ! A eighth of an inch 
high? Certainly no more than that! 
And it seemed that, as Somers bent 
lower to look, Toro was gazing up, 
with a waving arm in gesture of de- 
fiance. 

Almost invisible now. Somers 
blinked. He heard Alden mutter, 
“Gone!” 

“No. Still there!” Somers was al- 
most sure he saw the tiny moving 
speck which was Toro — and the pin- 
point dot of Anne’s blue-white dress. 
There was a tiny, ridged crack in the 
caked dirt — smaller than one would 
make with the scratch of a fingernail. 
It seemed that the moving specks had 
dropped into it — vanished. 

Somers breathed again. And then 
he tensed. “George,” he murmured, 
“give me a match. I' don’t dare look

away. I don’t dare!” 

Somers continued to stare at the 
spot. His groping hand took the match 
from Alden. Then he bent lower and 
very carefully stuck the match up- 
right into the dirt, a half or three- 
quarters of an inch from where Anne 
had disappeared. Carefully he mem- 
orized the direction. 

Two pellets? Would that dwindle 
them quickly enough? 

He stood with Alden, both of them 
pale and tense. They held the pellets 
ready. Somers nodded to Alden and 
simultaneously they swallowed the 
drug. 

Somers instinctively closed his 
eyes. He was conscious of an instant 
sweetish, queerly aromatic taste in his 
mouth. His senses reeled with a 
dizzying swoop. , . . 



CHAPTER III 
Descent into Smallness 



S omers opened his eyes. The 
sense of swooping dizziness per- 
sisted for a mom.ent, and then clari- 
fied into a semblance of normality. 
He found Alden clinging to him. 
“You all right, Roy?” 

“Yes. Only I feel a queer tingling 
sensation.” 

They were seated together on the 
kitchen floor, with upraised knees and 
feet drawn close to their bodies. The 
little flower box was in front of them. 
To one side were the legs of the 
kitchen table, with its level top above 
their heads. Suddenly they were con- 
scious that the whole scene was in 
motion! 

The walls, the ceiling — everything 
in the kitchen seemed to be slowly 
shifting. A queer, steady, crawling 
change. Slow at first, like the hands 
of a clock whose movement is barely 
perceptible. But the change was ob- 
vious. Ever5Tthing was expanding. 

And the movement was not only 
visual. They could feel it now. The 
floor was crawling outward under 
them. It drew their feet out, so that 
their knees shifted down with tiny 
jerks. They had to hitch themselves 



into new positions to maintain bal- 
ance. 

Amazing — but after a moment they 
found the physical strangeness pass- 
ing. 

They stood up, clinging together 
with the floor shifting under their feet 
— pulling their feet apart so that 
every moment they had to take a step 
inward. And the movement was ac- 
celerating. 

A weird change was taking place. 
The table legs were huge. The table 
top was higher than their heads. The 
flower box seemed to have doubled its 
size ; and it was no longer near them. 
Six feet away now, and shifting, 
crawling steadily further into the ex- 
panding distance. 

Somers laughed grimly. “Got to 
keep our wits — not get rattled.” 

“Yes. I think we’d better go over 
there.” 

They started walking. The sensa- 
tion was strange, but in a moment 
they got used to it. Six feet to the 
flower box? They took a few steps. 
But the box was drawing away. They 
ran. The wall of the box was at their 
shoulders when they reached it. A 
shoulder-high green fence. 

They scrambled up over it, tumbled 
in a heap onto the dirt. Somers saw, 
some six feet away, a round white 
pole sticking up, waist-high. The 
match ! Another few feet beyond it 
would be the place where Anne had 
gone. 

“Mustn’t go there yet!” Somers 
warned. “We’re too big. Might 
trample her.” 

For a moment they stood, with the 
waist-high grass blades expanding 
around them. From the edge of the 
box, there was a drop of thirty or 
forty feet. The kitchen tabletop was 
a monstrous plateau a quarter of a 
mile away and high in the sky. 

Sky? No — the wide expanse of 
ceiling was still visible as a blur above 
them — an expanding, fading blur. The 
electric light bulb up there was a dis- 
tant spot of white glare. 

How long they stood engrossed, 
Somers did not realize. Then he 
swung about ; his heart pounded with 
alarm. The white match-stick was a 



106 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



great pole eighteen or twenty feet 
high. And it was thirty or forty feet 
away. Beyond it, very distant over 
the huge grass fronds, a great tower- 
ing shape was visible. 

Somers moved to where, between 
the twenty-foot leaves of the grass, 
he would see that towering shape 
clearly. A crooked pillar of brown- 
green, towering up hundreds of feet 
to a blurred mass of red. 

The geranium. A lake of muddy 
water was at its bottom. 

Alden, too, was staring in amaze- 
ment. And suddenly he was gripping 
Somers. 

“Things moving! My God, you see 
them?” 

The world of the flower box! 

Steadily, with a constant accelera- 
tion, it was opening up. And there 
were things alive here, of course. With 
a trembling hand, Alden was pointing 
at the expanding tower of the gerani- 
um-stem. Things alive on it? They 
were too far away now to be distin- 
guished clearly. But undoubtedly 
there were moving, living beings. 

A new world here. And in it, time 
was lost — size was lost. Size and 
distance always changing. Everything 
growing swiftly gigantic — and mov- 
ing away into newly created realms of 
distance. 

Then, suddenly, Somers became 
aware of the match-stick again. It 
was a gleaming white column now. It 
towered two hundred feet into the 
blue-white blur of sky. And it was 
at least four hundred feet away over 
the tumbled expanse of dirt and rock ! 

Somers went cold. The column was 
receding so fast! Could they reach 
it? 

Somers ran, with his companion 
floundering after him. Four hundred 
feet? He knew he had run that far, 
but still the gigantic white column 
loomed ahead. Then, panting, almost 
winded, they reached it; ran around 
its huge curving side. 

“This way,” Somers panted. “To- 
ward the geranium!” 

The geranium plant was only a blur 
in the distance with a gleaming radi- 
ance shining upon the watery ex- 



panse at its base. Somers headed to- 
ward it. Another desperate run. 

Amazing realms of smallness — ^miles 
of rocky cragstrewn waste,, ridged and 
pitted — little gullies opening. They 
leaped over them. They stumbled, fell 
— picked themselves up, and ran on. 

“Roy — ^wait — I can’t — I’m all out of 
breath.” 

Somers stopped. Despair was in his 
heart. They had waited too long. They 
could never reach that crack. 

Alden came panting up. “Take it 
easy. We’ve got to keep together.” 

“We’ve got to reach that crack!” 

Alden smiled grimly. “If we’re too 
small, we can get larger, you know. 
No need of all this running,” he 
added. 

Both realized that the tumbled area 
of rocky distance had lost its move- 
ment. The drug’s action had worn 
off. 

They peered into the half light. 
Rocks were strewn here now. Gi- 
gantic green stalks rose into the sky 
behind them: the grass blades. Mem- 
ory came to Somers. This was the 
place where Toro had stood, carrying 
Anne ! 

“Roy — look off there!” 

Somers followed the gesture. A 
mile or two away, the rocky ground 
suddenly burst upward. An earth- 
quake — a monstrous cataclysm! It 
shook them, with the rocks shudder- 
ing under their feet. A distant up- 
heaval. The ground rising as though 
by a vast explosion. Yet it was a slow 
upheaval. A pushing upward. A 
mountain of earth rising a hundred 
or two hundred feet into the air, and 
falling back into a huge tumbled lit- 
ter of broken rock. 

The roar of it came echoing from 
the distance — a queer, crashing roar, 
blurred and muffled. 

They stood gazing, transfixed. The 
earth had been pushed upward by a 
monster coming up from under- 
ground. A mile or two away — but 
still they could see the gigantic shape. 
Was it a reptile from the prehistoric 
ages — a monstrous serpent hundreds 
of feet long? 

They could see it slithering, twist- 
ing, coiling itself, then lengthening 



ELIXIR OF DOOM 



107 



out, moving away until in a moment 
it had vanished. 




White-faced, Somers turned to his 
companion. He tried to laugh. The 
tension of his taut nerves made him 
feel suddenly hysterical. 

“George, do you know what that 
%vas?” 

“My God, no!” 

“A worm, wriggling up through the 
loose dirt! A worm — in the flov/er 
box!” 

Astonishing aspects of size! Size to 
govern one’s viewpoint of everything ! 
That monster, only a miserable little 
worm. Why, here in the vial of drugs 
in his pocket was his ability to get 
large again — to change that distant 
fearsome monster back into a harm- 
less, wriggling little worm! 

Somers felt into his pockets to make 
sure that the vials were safe. He re- 
called the professor’s brief words con- 
cerning his drugs; an aura which they 
flung about the living organism they 
were altering — an aura like a magnet- 
ic field, so that his clothing and the 
small articles in his pockets were 
within its influence. Yes, the vials 
were sate! 

He laughed grimly. “We’ve sure 
got to keep our wits, George. This 
can be handled better than we’re do- 
ing it!” 

They were planning to take some 
of the enlarging drug.* And then they 
saw what was obviously the crack into 
v/hich Anne and Toro had vanished. 
It showed now as a yawning shadow 
across the landscape, about a quarter 
of a mile away. 

“Come on,” Somers said. “Easier to 



walk there than to take any more of 
the drug.” 

They started. Somers was ponder- 
ing what procedure Toro might have 
followed. One dose of the drug 
would have worn off now. Had Toro 
taken more? 

T hey came to the crack. Stood 
awed. It was a long, broken gully. 
A great ridge of upflung earth was 
here on the plateau of its upper brink. 
They stood on the tumbled summit, 
gazing down. 

“If they went down there,” Somers 
said dubiously, “I suppose we ought 
to climb down.” 

The descent did not take them long. 
They stood presently on the guliy 
floor, with the broken walls towering 
above them. The twilight was deep- 
er here. The sky was a ribbon of 
grey-blue haze. 

Silent, rocky desolation. Their low 
voices echoed with a queer, muffled 
quality. 

“But where have they gone?” Al- 
den was saying. “Roy, how can we 
ever find them?” 

There were plenty of rocky re- 
cesses here where Toro might be hid- 
ing. Somers took a step; then 
checked himself, shuddering. Anne 
might be here at his feet — tiny as an 
ant. His gaze swept the stone-littered 
gully floor. 

“George, what’s that over there?” 
he said abruptly. 

A little, crumpled white thing ten 
or fifteen feet away. They went and 
picked it up. It was a small square 
of white linen, smelling faintly of 
perfume. In its corner was a small 
embroidered “A.” 

Anne’s handkerchief! Had she 
dropped it here by accident; or was it 
a trail which she purposely had left 
for them to follow? 

“They were here,” Somers said, 
“that’s evident. I believe Anne 
dropped it purposely. She may have 
marked this spot here for us — to show 
that this is where they took the sec- 
ond dose of the drug.” 

They consulted. Then each took a 
second red pellet. The sensations 
were not so confusing this time. 



108 



THRILLING WONDER STORIES 



Crawling, shifting of the enlarging 
landscape. The handkerchief grew 
monstrous. A great billowing mass of 
white fabric. Presently it was higher 
than their heads. The strands were 
like plaited rope. The billowing folds 
were ten feet high. Then twenty feet. 

“George! Look here!” 

Alden was stooping. On the shift- 
ing ground which every moment was 
growing rougher, more broken, there 
lay a bent black wire. It was several 
feet long and rapidly enlarging. 

One of Anne’s hairpins! No mis- 
taking it! 

The trail into smallness! Brave 
little Anne, She had recovered from 
unconsciousness. She was alert now 
■ — ^leaving a trail for them to follow! 

And the deduction of another fact 
was easy. This monstrous hairpin — 
in another moment it was longer than 
Somers’ body — still was far smaller 
than normal compared to the gigantic, 
crumpled mass of the handkerchief. 
Anne and Toro had dwindled here. 
They had taken the second dose of 
the drug. And they were not moving 
very far in space, only in size. 

“We must keep ourselves here,” 
Somers said, “until this dose is worn 
off. I doubt if they’d take a third 
one.” 

Again he envisioned the enormity 
of smallness. This was only two pel- 
lets. With others, one might go down 
and down — into infinity. Every tiny 
widening crack here at his feet held 
new gigantic realms — if one were 
small enough to penetrate them. 
Every tiny grain of rock in this vast 
valley held a new universe of small- 
ness. 

At last the drug again wore off. 
Somers and Alden stood regarding a 
great, tumbled white hill. A thing 
indescribable. Billowing folds of 
shaggy white rope-strands woven into 
a titanic fabric. It stood piled into a 
huge mass fifty feet or so in height, 
with a spread of an acre or more. A 
score of entrances to the dark recesses 
under it were near at hand. Cave- 
mouth openings — and in one place a 
yawning oval ten feet high. 

Somers and Alden stood peering into 
the inner darkness. Was the trail 



lost? There had been no other sign 
from Anne. Were she and Toro mo- 
tionless now? Hiding somewhere 
here? 

“I wonder,” Somers said. “I just 
wonder — That cavern in there — ” 

From the yawning opening ahead 
there came a muffled scream. A cry 
of protest. Terror. Defiance! 

Anne’s voice! 

With Alden after him, Somers 
dashed forward, plunging into the 
blackness of the cavern. 



CHAPTER IV 
Combat of Size 



I T had seemed dark under the vast, 
billowy folds of the handkerchief. 
But when he got inside, Somers was 
at once aware of light. A reflected 
sheen from the fabric itself; and a 
dim effulgence from the rocks. He 
had noticed it outside in the gully a 
while ago — a glowing, dim phosphor- 
escence. 

Swiftly he and Alden dashed for- 
ward, their eyes rapidly becoming ac- 
customed to the softer light. The 
scream was not repeated. 

“Quiet!” Somers murmured. “Got 
to locate them.” He had stopped and 
stood clutching Alden. They listened, 
peering. 

A glowing labyrinth here. Round- 
ed, shelflike recesses in a dozen places 
of the cavern walls. And all of it 
plaited rope strands — so coarse a fab- 
ric that they could have climbed its 
rounded slopes. 

No sound. Eerie, phosphorescent 
darkness. . . . 

“Dios! Give me that!” 

Toro’s voice! The sound of a 
scuffle. And then they saw Toro and 
Anne. 

Two figures, seemingly of normal 
height. They were standing about 
fifty feet away, on a shelflike recess 
of the fabric wall some fifteen feet 
above the rocks. Toro, in white shirt 
and dark trousers; Anne in her pale- 
blue dress. Both mud-stained, with 
clothes torn by the journey. 

They stood on the ledge, struggling 



ELIXIR OF DOOM 



109 



— the man gripping her, cuffing her. 
“Dios! Give me that!” 

“1 won’t ! Kill me if you like — I 
won’t go any further I” 

They had not yet seen their pur- 
suers. Anne quite evidently had 
seized a vial of the drugs. He was 
trying to snatch it from her. 

The realization came to Somers as 
he and Alden dashed forward. He 
was aware that, up there on the ledge, 
Anne had jerked loose her arm and 
flung something away. The vial of 
diminishing drug. It hurtled through 
the air and fell to the rocky floor. 

Toro shouted an oath. And then 
he saw his oncoming enemies. Somers 
already had reached the slope which 
led to the ledge. He leaped upon the 
rough fabric, climbing it. Toro 
seemed stricken with astonishment. 
He stood defiant, thin, dark face livid 
with rage. His hand darted into his 
trousers pocket. 

The vial of the enlarging drug! 
Fiendish triumph distorted his face 
as he swallowed a pellet. And ab- 
ruptly Somers saw that he was grov/- 
ing. A slim Latin- American. But al- 
ready he was six feet tall! 

Alden was shouting : “After him! 
Kill him! I’ll come with you! Don’t 
let him escape with that drug !” 

In that second reason came to the 
stricken Somers. He fumbled in his 
pocket. The vial of enlarging drug! 
Take it quickly! Match this fellow 
in his growth! 

And he swung and shouted at Al- 
den : “You stay here ! Take care of 
Anne ! No — both of you get large — 
not so dangerous — but keep away 
from me! I’ll fight him!” 

Somers crammed two pellets into 
bis mouth. A seven-foot Toro, leer- 
ing with the triumph of his growing 
bulk, stood up there now. Then he 
turned, jumped backward down an- 
other slope, and vanished. 

Somers’ head had reeled from the 
drug, but almost at once the feeling 
passed. He was aware that the eerie, 
phosphorescent scene was shrinking. 
The fabric of ceiling was coming 
down; the walls closing in. 

These closing walls ! It startled 
Somers into a panic of confusion. He 



stood tense, clinging to the slope of 
the fabric. But its surface was 
smoothing ; the spaces between the 
rope-strands were closing on his fin- 
gers. He could feel the surface bend- 
ing under his weight. 

And suddenly he slipped, saved 
himself from falling by a backward 
leap. He had thought it was a drop 
of nearly ten feet — but it seemed only 
tw'o or three. He got his balance; 
stood wavering. On the dwindling 
rock-ground across the cavern lay 
Anne, with her brother holding her. 
Dwindling figures — already they were 
no longer than Somers’ arm. 

^^HERE was a blur of movement as 
^ Toro made a rush through a nar- 
rowing side-passage. Somers scram- 
bled after him. The shrinking fabric 
wails scraped him as he wedged 
through. Panting, he got outside, 
turned and beheld the small tunnel- 
way through which he had emerged. 
It was hardly big enough for his hand. 

“Dios! Got you now!” 

He swung around as the figure of 
Toro leaped upon him. They grap- 
pled. Somers’ mind was alert. Above 
everything he knew he must keep his 
wits. The shock of Toro’s weight 
made him stagger backv.?ard. Purpose- 
ly he went limp, sagged and fell, pull- 
ing his adversary down upon him. 
And then with a sudden lunge, twist- 
ed, and brought himself uppermost. 

He found Toro perhaps a foot 
larger than himself. Stronger, un- 
doubtedly. But both quite evidently 
had taken two of the pellets. It 
seemed that there was no relative 
change in Toro’s size. He and Somers 
were enlarging with equal rapidity. 

Somers found himself straddling 
Toro’s chest. The fellow was lunging, 
squirming, flailing with his fists. 

Around him, Somers was aware of 
the dizzying, swooping scene. All 
shrinking. Rocky walls of the val- 
ley lowering and closing. And almost 
at his side was a crumpled white 
handkerchief. He was gripping Toro’s 
throat ; and Toro, with his breath shut 
off, was choking, his eyes bulging. 

But tire sight of the shrinking 
handkerchief set Somers shuddering. 



110 



THRltLING WONDER STORIES 



It seemed, with that instant glance, 
that he saw the tiny figure of Alden, 
carrying Anne — trying to run. 

Realization swept Somers. At any 
instant his leg, or the flailing legs of 
the prostrate Toro, might mangle 
those tiny running figures. He cast 
Toro off. He leaped erect. Stooping, 
he snatched Toro sideward. Barely 
in time! It seemed that the handker- 
chief was almost under Somers’ feet. 

The double dosage of the drug had 
confused Somers so that he scarcely 
thought of combat with his human 
enemy. 

But Toro had lunged to his feet. He 
stood panting; and then he jumped 
again upon Somers. They wrestled; 
fought with wild, scrambling blows. 
Somers felt the thud of Toro’s fist 
upon his head. Toro’s face was close 
as he panted: 

“I can conquer the world with these 
drugs! I dropped some of it — but I 
have plenty left — ” 

“You have to do for me first,’’ Som- 
ers retorted. 

But his adversary was strong. He 
was bending Somers backward now, 
his weight pressing — his dark, satur- 
nine face leering with triumph. 
Somers felt himself backing against 
a rocky wall. Incredible, for beyond 
Toro’s shoulder there was another 
wall advancing. 

And Toro saw the danger. He mum- 
bled with startled horror. His grip 
loosened; he jerked away. Somers, 
m.om.entarily free, recovered his bal- 
ance. God! These closing walls! 
This was no valley in whic’n they were 
fighting! No more than a narrow 
rocky trench, a few feet wide and 
shoulder-high. 

Horrified realization swept Somers. 
In another moment his gigantic bulk 
would be mangled here between these 
rocky sides. He saw Toro make a 
leap and scramble upward. The ditch- 
walls v/ere pressing; but the upper 
surface had come down to Somers’ 
waist. He jumped; drew himself up 
and rolled out. It seemed that the 
slit of rock was closing like a reptile’s 
mouth, trying to seize his emerging 
legs. 

The upper surface — familiar, undu- 



lating dirt and rocky terrain lay 
spread in the distance. As Somers 
staggered erect, dizzy with the dwin- 
dling scene, again the murderous 
Toro came at him. . . . 

® OWN under the giant folds of 
the handkerchief, Anne and her 
brother saw the enlarging form of 
Toro rush away; and the gigantic 
Somers after him. Alden was aware 
of the danger. He lifted Anne. 

“Can you walk?” 

“I — I guess so. I’m — better now.” 
“Got to get outside — get away. 
They’ll be too large — might trample 
us.” 

An amazing scene encountered 
them as they ran outside. A combat 
of giants ! They saw the fallen Toro ; 
Somers astride his chest, choking him. 
Men twenty feet tall. Now' thirty 
feet! 

In another moment, Alden realized, 
these giants would trample the hand- 
kerchief. The sweep of one of their 
legs would presently encompass a 
hundred feet of this rocky ground. 

Anne was limping with a twisted 
ankle. Alden picked her up, carried 
her, running to escape. 

“I can take the drug now,” Anne 
murmured. “Foolish of me to be 
afraid of it. Put me dov/n. We’d bet- 
ter take it, George.” 

He thought so, too. The gigantic 
trouser legs of Somers and Toro — 
great sv/aying pillars rising into the 
air, lunged back and forth. Dizzying, 
mammoth blurs in the gloom. The 
enormous bodies were blotting out 
the sky. 

Suddenly the Titan shapes lifted 
upward and were gone. Alden and 
Anne each took a pellet of the drug. 
The valley closed in on them. They 
scrambled out to the surface. 

The giants were still fighting. 
There was more light out here, and 
they were plainly visible. It seemed 
that now they were fully a mile away. 
They swayed, locked together. Five 
hundred feet tall? It seemed so. 
Then they went down, rolling, lung- 
ing. Then up again, staggering with 
mammoth strides. 

And then Anne cried, “Oh, look! 



ELIXIR OF DOOM 



111 



Dear God — look at Roy !” 

Somers had. been beaten to his 
knees. Toro’s fists were raining blows 
upon him. Then, suddenly, as though 
with supreme effort, Somers was 
erect. One of his arms dangled be- 
hind him. The watchers saw that the 
dangling hand held a boulder. And 
Somers heaved it aloft and crashed it 
down full on Toro’s head. 

There was a breathless moment 
while Toro stood wavering. The 
boulder dropped with a great roar to 
the ground; and Somers staggered 
back, panting. 

A breathless instant. Then the body 
of Toro fell forward — came toppling, 
crashing down. For a moment its 
thousand-foot length writhed and 
twisted. Then it lay still, with the 
mammoth figure of Somers bending 
over it. 



CHAPTER V 
Tiny Arena 

S omers bent down, panting, 
over the fallen body of his antag- 
onist. Toro was dead. No doubt of 
that ; the smashed, weltering head was 
mute, gruesome evidence. And there 
v/as other evidence: in that moment 
Somers was aware that the motionless 
dead thing was dwindling. Death had 
checked the effect of the drug. 

He stood now, swaying over Toro. 
The body had seemed perhaps seven 
feet long. He saw it shrinking now. 
The whole rocky terrain was shrink- 
ing. Vague distant blurs of monstrous 
shapes were dwindling, coming closer, 
taking familiar form. Why, these 
tremendous green stalks — they were 
blades of grass! That giant, yellow- 
white pole — that was the match-stick ! 
Somers hastily retreated. He must 
keep away from that match-stick. Al- 
den and Anne might so easily be 
trampled. 

Minutes more ■ of the shrinking 
landscape. And every moment it was 
more familiar. That great red blur 
in the sky — that was the geranium 

blossom. . . . 

Somers turned the other way. The 



great green stalks were thickening 
around him. Hardly higher than his 
head now, and he pushed his way 
through them. Presently he was wad- 
ing in them, with their tops lower 
than his waist. 

He came to a knee-high parapet 
with an abyss beyond it and a great 
blurred vista of open distance. But 
the blurs off there were taking form. 
The monstrous blurred spread of sur- 
face, off there so high and far away, 
came down and shrank and showed 
itself to be the kitchen table. 

Somers stood peering over the 
brink of the flower boK. The vastness 
of the kitchen floor seemed a hun- 
dred feet below him. But soon it was 
fifty — twenty. . . . 

He swung over the edge. For a mo- 
ment he clung, dangling by his hands. 
A drop of ten feet. He let go. Land- 
ed on his feet. The wall of the flow- 
er box dwindled to his shoulders. 

The action of the drug was wear- 
ing off. Somers sat on the open kitch- 
en floor until the movement of the 
scene had ceased The little flower box 
was here. Two feet long; a foot wide 
— six inches deep. He bent anxiously 
over the small spread of dirt, peer- 
ing, waiting for Anne and her brother. 

They came at last. Tiny figures, 
enlarging. Shoving through the grass 
— climbing, as he had climbed, over 
the side and out of the box. Carefully, 
he lifted the tiny six-inch figure of 
Anne and set her on the floor; but 
the dizzying swoop of his carrying 
hand left her gasping. 

At last they were together again, 
and all things assumed their normal 
proportions. 

Moonlight streamed in through the 
open window of the darkened kitch- 
en. The placid summer ocean rippled 
with silver. Somers sat with Anne 
beside him. Alden was in the adjoin- 
ing room, at the radio sender. 

“I think,” Somers said out of a si- 
lence, “that the drugs should be de- 
stroyed. Too dangerous. And the 
flower box — the drugs are in it. De- 
stroy this flower box — ’’ 

The girl shuddered. “Yes. Poor 
father — ”

ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 

Editor, Science Questions and Answers: 

I was surprised the other day to find that 
the chemical formulae of cane sugar and 
milk sugar are the same — This 
seems a little odd, since they are different 
in sweetening power. From what little 
chemistry I’ve had, I always understood 
that different substances must have differ- 
ent formulae. 

F. B„ 

Gloucester, Virginia. 

The study of sugars and related com- 
pounds belongs in the realm of organic 
chemistry — the compounds of carbon. The 
Incredibly numerous compounds containing 
carbon are all due to the latter's remarkable 
ability to hook up with almost anything in 
chains, rings, and other formations. 

All sugars are basically of the foi-mula 
given above, but each is put together in a 
different way, with resulting differences in 
taste, appearance, and chemical activity. If 
the 45 atoms in a general sugar molecule 
were arranged merely by chance, there 
could be 5,566,000,000,000.000,000 different 
combinations. Only a few dozen are known, 
however. 

In organic chemistry, the formula above 
means nothing. It .simply indicate.^ the pro- 
portions by weight of carbon, hydrogen and 
oxygen. For a true indication of compo- 
sition, the organic chemist uses “structural 
formulae” -which show exactly how the 
molecule is put together. He can show, by 
the change in position of atom?, why this 
sugar and that are quite different. 

As a typical example, common alcohol has 
the same formula — — as methyl ether, 
which is poisonous. When we look at the 
chemist’s structural formulae, \ve see how 
they are different. Alcohol is 
Methyl ether is This difference in 

“hooking up” makes all the difference be- 
tween a liquid which can be drunk, and one 
which cannot, besides many other differ- 
•nces. Ed. 



THE PHENOMENON OF SLEEP 

Editor, Science Questions and .Answers: 

How is sleeping explained? When our 
brain sleeps, why do not the heart or lungs 
do the same? 

L. B„ 

Brooklyn, N. Y. 

The phenomenon of sleep has lately been 
much clarified. Intensive biochemical re- 
search has revealed that there is a 
rhythm to life. It pulsates, much like a 
wave. The pulsations are periods of activity 
and rest. Activity drives all the body’s 
chemical processes in one direction, toward 
fatigue. This state is characterized by the 
presence of excess phosphates in the blood. 
To complete the cycle, the organic organism 
must have rest. This allows the chemical 
processes to reverse and prepare for an- 
other stretch of activity. 

Fortunately, however, nature has pro- 
vided that our heart and lungs have a 
different system of rest periods than our 
brain, muscles and bodj^ cells in general. 
This was necessary because the animal or- 
ganism cannot survive any extended period 
of rest for the heart, lungs, and stomach. 
These organs work and rest — pulsate — 
very rapidly. After each heartbeat, the 
heart rests for a fraction of a second. After 
each breath, the lungs take a short “nap.” 
The total amount of rest in a day’s time for 
the heart is about the same as that we give 
our bodies when we lie down and sleep. Ed. 

■ CANALS OF MARS 

Editor, Science Questions and Answers: 

What is all the discussion on the “canals” 
of Mars about? Isn’t it definitely known 
whether they are there or not? One would 
think such an easily observed phenomenon 
would have been settled long ago. 

F. L„ 

Madison, Wisconsin. 

Strange to say, the authenticity of the 
Martian “canals” has not been proved. In 



1877 Shiaparelli, v/ho was admittedly 
sharp-eyed, announced that he saw fine line 
markings on Mars, which he called “canali.” 
Unfortunately, that Italian word is far too 
suggestive when transposed to English. 
Shiaparelli meant channels, not man-made 
canals. 

Since bis time the discussion has waxed 
furious. Famous astronomers corroborated 
his discovery. Equally famous ones denied 
their existence. Lately, it is becoming gen- 
erally credited that no such regular and 
numerous markings occur as Shiaparelli and 
and Lowell claimed to see. Experiments 
conducted in the laboratory indicate that 
the human eye and mind have a tendency 
to connect faint spots and markings by 
wholly imaginary straight lines. 

In the case of viewing Mars in a tele- 
scope, the image is very hazy at best. It 
literally takes a conscious straining of the 
eye to distinguish even the larger markings. 
The so-called canals, being at the limit of 
visibility, may be subjective (imagined) 
rather than objective (seen). Photography 
has failed to reveal the mythical canals. 
But the claim is made, justifiably, that un- 
der the best of conditions, the eye is more 
sensitive than the photographic plate, so 
there is still no positive evidence on either 
side. 

Perhaps the only sure check on this en- 
grossing question will be when man finds 
a way to traverse space and explore 
Mars himself. Ed. 



FILTERABLE VIRUSES 

Editor, Science Questions and Answers: 
I’ve noticed that the filterable viruses are 
being called “living liquids,” as in the 
Farley story recently. Science fiction aside, 
are they truly alive? 

O. L. S., 

San Francisco, Calif. 



Strictly speaking, the answer is probably 
no. Filterable viruses seem to be more of 
the quality of subtle poisons than of living 
matter. It seems that -some diseases, like 
the “mosaic disease” of the tobacco plant 
and silkworm jaundice, produce a lethal 
substance which is able to interfere with 
the metabolism of healthy tissue. 

Unlike cultures of germs, the virus is 
filterable through the finest of porcelain 
filters, indicating that it must have a 
colloidal composition. Whatever the sub- 
stance is which can reinfect tissue with the 
disease that produced it, it is not composed 
of the germs and micro-organisms we know 
at present. Either its potency is due to in- 
credibly tiny living organisms matched in 
size by some of the larger molecules, or to 
super-powerful poisons which in undetect- 
able quantities can poison a mass of pro- 
toplasm unthinkably greater in mass.

BINDER ILLUSTRATION LIKED 

By Fred C. Miles 

Here are orchids for two fine tales in 
the February, 1937 issue of THRILLING 
WONDER STORIES; “The World in a 
Box,’’ by Carl Jacobi, and “The Ice 
Entity,” by Jack Williamson. Though not 
as good as “The Legion of Space,” “The 
Ice Entity” was a vastly interesting story. 
Presented in the same issue as Jacobi’s 
stort story, it helped to make the best of 
the four numbers of the rejuvenated T. 
W. S. 

Was very delighted to see a drav/ing by 
Jack Binder in this issue. The yarn it 
illustrated was the third best in my favor 
for the month. The cover was excellent. 
Almost photographic in its realism. Keep 
up the good work. — New Providence, New 
Jersey. 

J. R. FEARN, THE TOPS 

By John V. Baltadonis 

Fearn’s story, “Brain of Venus,” takes 
the cake for February, as far as I’m con- 
cerned. The way it started out, I thought 
for sure that the ending was obvious; 
there I was waiting for the introduction 
of the heroine to marry Captain Brant, 
when, bango, he gets killed. That in itself 
stunned me; but, v/hen the second hero 
of the story got killed .... I’ve got to 
hand it to Fearn for having enough nerve 
to write a story having two heroes, and 
both getting killed. 

“Protoplasmic Station,” by Paul Ernst, 
wasn’t as good as I had expected it to be. 
However, it did provide good reading mat- 
ter. “Invaders From the Outer Suns,” by 
Frank B. Long, Jr., had a novel twist. 
Williamson’s “Ice Entity” was something 
new. 

Wandrei’s “Black Fog” looked like just 
another death cloud story at first. Only 
this time, instead of a hero and heroine 
emerging victorious at the end, mankind 
really is doomed. Quite a surprise twist. 



I agree with Ronald Armitage on the 
subject of cartoons. Why not pick a better 
subject? — 1700 Frankfort Ave., Philadel- 
phia, Penna. 

A FIRST LETTER 

By John Hartos 

Having just finished the February issue 
of T. W. S. I feel that I must write you 
in appreciation. Carl Jacobi’s story, 
“World in a Box,” is the best story in the 
issue. The others, too, are good. “Zarnak,” 
by Max Plaisted, is a good idea and a 
pleasant variation from the fiction con- 
tent. 

The December issue rated pretty highly 
too. Zagat’s “Lanson Screen” and “The 
Brain-Stealers of Mars” by John W. 
Campbell, Jr., were among the best in that 
number. 

This is the first letter I have ever writ- 
ten to any magazine. — 30 Center Street, 
Hempstead, New York. 

(Readers will be interested to learn that Mr. 
Campbell has written more stories concerning 
the interplanetary adventures of his two in- 
trepid space-rovers, Blake and Penton. The 
first of these will soon be ready for publication. 
How about other first-letter writers sending in 
notes to this department? — Ed.) 

REQUESTS 

By John Chapman 

The February T. W. S. is the best of 
the four issues published up to now. If you 
keep improving as you have been, you’ll 
soon reach the top. 

Fearn’s “Brain of Venus” was unusual. 
Try to obtain more of his stories. Wandrei 
comes second with “Black Fog.” These 
two authors are about the only ones who 
really know how to end a story with a 
wallop. Instead of the routine procedure 
in which the fair-haired hero saves Earth 
and lives to win the heroine, etc., etc. 
Fearn discarded the hackneyed ballyhoo 
and reversed the situation so that the hero 
sacrificed himself to save the entire uni- 
verse. And no heroine, either! 
lU 



“Judgment Sun” will be the third Eando 
Binder story you have published since 
August. By all means keep up that pace. 
Binder is without doubt one of science 
fiction’s greatest writers, and I’ll never be 
tired of reading his stories. 

Some other authors I’d like to see in 
T. W. S. are Murray Leinster, Nat Schach- 
ner, Frank K. Kelly and A. Rowley 
Hilliard. 

The illustrations are great. Marchioni 
is the king of artists. Keep him and don’t 
bother about securing anyone else unless 
it would be Paul. — 1521 Como Ave., S. 
£., Minneapolis, Minn. 

(There’s another Binder novelette for you 
next month— his best story to date. — Ed.) 



OVERSEAS OPINION 

By S. Youd 

Although I never wrote to the old mag- 
azine, I am writing now to welcome the 
old mag back. It was with mingled feel- 
ings that I tore the wrapper off your 
December issue and saw that Paul was 
gone. Your cover artist is good, however, 
and I’d like to see him alternate with Paul. 

Your lay-out is good. Especially the 
forecast for the next issue; how about a 
“Coming Shortly” feature? I am looking 
forward to all the stories announced for 
the next number. The outstanding stories 
in the December issue were: “The Lanson 
Screen” — the only good story I’ve ever 
read by Zagat — and was it good! “The 
Brain-Stealers of Mars” — the funniest 
story I’ve read in ages — Campbell is a 
worthy successor to Weinbaum. And, of 
course, the Weinbaum tale, “Brink of In- 
finity.” Gallun’s “Saturn’s Ringmaster” 
was appealing mainly because of the 
Uranian professor character. Let’s have 
more stories about him. 

Would like to see stories by P. S. Miller, 
Hamilton, Leinster, Keller, Harris, Hil- 
liard, Pragnell, Williamson and Zagat — if 
he can produce another like “The Lanson 
Screen.” — 244 Desborough Road East- 
leigh, Hants, England. 

NOSEGAYS AND BRICKBATS 

By Norm W. Sirirsger 

I was very glad to see the reappearance 
of your magazine on the newsstands, al- 
though there is room for improvement. I 
found the December issue containing one 
excellent story, incidentally the best that 
you have published thus far, Campbell’s 
“Brain Stealers of Mars.” Two other 
yarns, “The Brink of Infinity” and “The 
Lanson Screen,” were very good and took 
second and third places respectively. The 
contributions by Hamilton and Cummings 
made good reading. 

The plot of Campbell’s story was un-

usual and new, as was the ease with Wein» 
baum’s story. Zagat told an old story with 
a new twist, while Cummings and Hamilton 
took hackneyed but interesting plots and 
filled their stories with exciting adven- 
tures. So ended the good half of the mag- 
azine. As for the inferior stories, they 
were: “Earth-Venus 12,” by Gabriel Wil- 
son. This story was good once — but long 
ago. Well written, though, taking sixth 
place. Echols’ story was formula stuff. 
“Static” was too short and dry. 

Now for some general criticisms. You 
should try to print a serial. A novelette 
should be at least sixteen pages long. Keep 
your authors away from the time-worn 
themes. T. W. S. is only published every 
other month. I believe that it should be 
published monthly, or oftener. 

And here are bouquets. T. V/. S. has 
brought back many famous old authors to 
science fiction. Cummings, Merritt, Farley, 
Kline, Burks — they’re all good. The gen- 
eral run of your stories tend to be written 
in the principle of “story first, then 
science.” This is a v/ise plan; a story may 
be dominant in science and have an entire- 
ly new conception but it will fail to hold 
the reader’s attention because it is poorly 
written, and then again a story may be well 
written and fail to click because the plot 
is too old. Consequently, your stories 
cover a larger scope because your require- 
ments as to science content are more tol- 
erant. 

My ten favorites are Merritt, Burroughs, 
Cummings, Farley, Williamson, Burks, 
Leinster, Coblentz, Verrill, and Hamilton. 
Six of these men write for you. Keep 
them! — 17710 Franklin Boulevard, Lake-

By Frances Robertson 

Best artist — Marchioni ; best author —

opinion of your s-f magazine! Stories 
wanted: Professor Jameson yarns. Type 
wanted: stories of what happens after the 
end of time; stories of the distant un- 
known future. Articles wanted: a series 
of articles on famous scientists. 

Departments wanted: a department deal- 
ing with higher mathematics, discussing 
the 4th dimension, etc. Contests wanted: 
short s-f contest stories. General appeal: 
a bigger and better magazine, with more 
stories back west.

what’s wanted now. Do we get it? I hope 
so! — G. D., Rhododendron, Oregon.

the first place the cover is excellent. As 
a contrast to the past three issues, the 
figures are lifelike and their faces express 
varied emotions. In my estimation the best 
tale in the issue was Fearn’s “Brain of 
Venus.” Of the short stories, “World in 
a Box” is tops! “He- Who Masters Time” 
was also interesting. “Zarnak” is terrible 
and I wish you’d blow it to atoms. Couldn’t 
you have the artist shanghaied? 

But now I have thrown enough brick- 
bats, so how about some friendly sugges- 
tions? Would it be possible to enlarge 
the interesting “Science Questions and 
Answers?” And hov/ about more of those 
very interesting questions in “Test Your 
Science Knowledge?” After reading some 
of your stories, I found more material for 
questions that were untouched. “The 
Reader Speaks” is altogether too short. 
We fellers like to know what others think 
of T. W. S. I know all this is a big order 
to fill, but by all means try to enlarge 
"Science Questions and Answers.” — 109

this issue. Enough? — Ed.) 

"ZARNAK"—??? 

By Irving L. Koskow 

Although the December issue of 
THRILLING WONDER STORIES is 
the best of your three issues thus far, there 
remain some minor imperfections. 

First and foremost, take that comic (!) 
strip, “Zarnak,” out! It’s not only child- 
ish but silly. Please bear in mind that 
many of your readers are not adolescents 
and constitute a goodly portion of your 
circulation. The space wasted on “Zarnak” 
could be used to advantage in enlarging 
"The Reader Speaks.” 

I must congratulate you on the other 
departments and features. Most note- 
worthy of these are "Story Behind the 
Story” and “Scientifacts.” 

"Brain-Stealers of Mars” was most novel 
and interesting of all the stories in the 
issue. There is but one correction I’d 
like to offer concerning this story. Granted 
that a type of animal such as described 
is capable of changing its protoplasm, 
(given a sufficient amount to v/ork with) 
how could it possibly reproduce a space- 
suit, or bits of metal which are not or- 
ganic, from organic protoplasm? 

“Mutiny on Europa” was a fine tale, on 
a par with Campbell’s yarn. — 3415 Fulton 
Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. 

(Ho-w many readers like "Zarnak”? There’s 
a fm-iouH battle going on about the strip's 
merits. Come on, Plaisted supporters, let’s hear 
from you. What kind of a plot would you 
want “Zarnak” to have? Your point about the 
Campbell story i.s well taken, but remember 
that the thushol did not create the space suits 
— they stole them from the space .ship. They 
could only simulate inorganic substances ex- 
ternally, of course. — Ed.)

SCIENCE QUESTIONS 
AND ANSWERS 

Continued from Page 113) 
eases credited to the activity of filterable 
viruses. 

Such poisons which could "grow” almost 
like microbes in a new host would be on 
the order of enzymes (feiments), which dis- 
solve and change organic matter and in- 
crease at the same time their own amounts. 
Enzymes are purely chemical, non-living 
materials. Yet it is still an open question 
whether the filterable virus is a micro- 
microbe culture, in which case it would be 
"alive.” Ed. 

(Note: According to data made available 
just as we were going to press, filterable 
viruses have been discovered to be protein 
molecules existing on the borderline be- 
tween the living and the non-living.) 

SKIN PIGMENTATION 

Editor, Science Questions and Answers; 

Albinos are explained as lacking pigmen- 
tation. How does this occur? Can there 
be albinos of any animal? 

G. W. P. 

Hartford, Conn. 

Although no complete survey has been 
made, it is undoubtedly possible that there 
can be, and have been, albinos in every 
species of animal. White blackbirds, white 
crows, white swifts, white rabbits, white 
rats, and such are well known where the 
original stock is heavily pigmented. 

In albinos the factors for pigmentation 
have been lost in the intricate nuclear com- 
binations which occur in the ripening 
germ-cells. In the case of an animal with 
one of the dark pigments (melanins), it is 
necessary for a ferment (tyrosinase) to act 
on a pigment-producing substance called 
tyrosin. If either factor drops out of in- 
heritance, the fertilized egg-cell develops 
into an albino. The phenomenon is com- 
paratively rare because the pigment cells 
are “hardy,” in the biological sense, being 
closely related to skin cells which are 
toughest of all. 

There is also a form of albinism which 
is acquired rather than prenatal. Cases 
have been observed of animals such as 
chickens changing from black to white, or 
move rarely, of human hair whitening over- 
night. In such cases of "false albinism,” 
the pigment matter can be found to have 
moved to a new locale, as for instance the 
liver. It is de-pigmentation rather than 
non-pigmentation. Ed. 

ASTRONO,My SUPERSTITIOUS? 

Editor, Science Questions and Answers: 

Is there a direct connection between the 
motions of the moon around Earth and 
Earth around the sun? If so, why doesn’t 
our calendar indicate that the true month 
is one-thirteenth of a vear? Superstition ? 

M. P., 

Salt Lake City, Utah. 



120 



There is no mechanical connection between 
the separate orbital motions of Earth and 
moon. If the moon were miraculously to 
increase its speed of revolution by twice, 
it would move outward from Earth, but 
Earth would not change its periods of ro- 
tation and revolution noticeably. 

By coincidence, the moon’s period of rev- 
olution divides almost exactly thirteen 
times into a year. The ancients tried their 
best to work the moon-period into the year, 
with indifferent success. In the hey-dey of 
Roman civilization, no two people agreed 
as to the year since the first of the Caesars. 
Julius Caesar, with the aid of a competent 
astronomer, established in 45 B. C. the 
calendar bearing his name, which is in use 
today except for the modifications made 
by Pope Gregory in 1582 A. D. Julius 
CaesaPs success in making a calendar that 
lost no more than three days in 400 years 
was due to his disregarding the period of 
the moon entirely, which is incommensur- 
able with the year. Ed. 

ANiMAL LONGEVITV 

Editor, Science Questions and Answers: 

I don’t believe personally that a cat has 
nine lives, but I’ve heard some wild stories 
of how cats survive all sorts of deaths, and 
lots of people believe in it. Now' let’s see 
what a science-editor would have to say 
about it besides plain “Bah!” 

L. K., 

Long Branch, N. .1. 

A cat has fundamentally one life and one 
only. One bullet in its brain will kill it as 
sui-ely as it would any other creature. But 
the cat does seem to have a special tenacity 
for that one life. 

For one thing, it has by long evolution- 
ary processes developed to perfection the 
art of always landing on its feet. This 
faculty measurably increases its chances 
for longevity. Then it has those richly in- 
nervated long hairs, or “whiskers,” in its 
cheeks, which apprise it of danger in the 
dark upon contact. Added to this is an 
ability to see in depths of gloom in %vhich 
most other creatures except owls and bats 
are totally blind. It also has the homing 
instinct strongly developed, which enables 
it often to reach safety and shelter when 
stranded. Physically, it has a highly devel- 
oped, efficient body, well protected, from 
teeth to claws. Its senses of smell and 
hearing are very acute. And lastly, it has 
far more intelligence than is generally sus- 
pected. Its seeming dumbness is a camou- 
flage for a first-class thinking organ. 

All these points in its favor taken to- 
gether give the cat a distinct advantage 
in the grim game of eluding death. It is 
questionable whether even the anthropoids, 
with their semi-human intelligence, have 
greater survival value than the felines. Only 
man, with his guns and snares, has the 
power to rob the cat family of prestige 
in the iunele. Ed.

f MAGINATION among scientists 
is still the priceless ingredient. 
The wars of the future will be 
fought, if at all, in the atomic labora- 
tory. And it’s a safe bet that the har- 
nessing of atomic energy will be dis- 
covered only by accident. Through- 
out the history of science accident 
has been the important agency respon- 
sible for uncovering the great scien- 
tific wonders. 

For example, in 1300 Berthold 
Schwarz was attempting to find a 
compound for making the philosoph- 
er’s stone. All of a sudden his table 
of chemicals exploded on him. Gun- 
powder was discovered. 

GALVANS’S DISCOVERY 

In 1789 an Italian doctor named 
Luigi Galvans, quite by accident, 
came upon a dramatic scene which 
gave us electricity in circuit. Galvani 
noticed that v/henever his electric 
machine began to spark between 
electrodes, a frog’s legs w^’hich he had 
freshly dissected, lying on a metal 
plate, began simultaneously to twitch 
as though it were alive. 

By hanging a dozen frogs’ legs to 
dry by copper hooks on an iron grille, 
he played with the idea of animation 
again, and the whole line began to 
move, even v.?ithout the aid of the 
electric machine nearby. Thus cur- 
rent was born. 

And so it will be in the future. 
Scientists with imagination and en- 
thusiasm will scoop their more prac- 
tical-minded contemporaries.

“What Can I Do to Promote Science 
Fiction?” Winners of prizes — a free

Following is the best letter, written 
by Mr. Robert A. Madle: 

The question, "What can 1 do to promote 
.science fiction?” has often confronted the really 
Interested science fiction enthusiast. If a per- 
son is actively interested in science fiction, he 
goes to any extremes, within reason, of course, 
to stimulate interest in the type of fiction he 
loves. 

In ray three years of scientifictional activities 
I have employed various methods of introduc- 
ing science fiction to the general public. At 
school, in my English class, I often devote my 
oral le.s-sons to sclentifiction. Many of my written 
compositions are also based on science fiction. 
Of course, there are those who scoff at my 
choice of reading matter, but I have interested 
quite a few hitherto anti-solencefictionists. An- 
other of my favorite methods is to make a pres- 
ent of a copy of a science fiction magazine to 
a person in whom I think could develop an 
interest in stories of the fantastic. I often

There are other ways of promoting science 
fiction. One method is to have an article, pro- 
pounding the interests of science fiction, pub- 
lished in the local newspaper. Unfortunately, 

I reside in a large city, and this makes the 
task much more difficult. If a student, it 
would be advisable to submit an article per- 
taining to science fiction to the school paper, 
as this would surely bring in more converts to 
sf. As soon as I have composed an article 
which I consider good, it will immediately be 
submitted to the editor of my paper 
There are probably ways other than the above 
to accomplish your intention, but those afore- 
mentioned are the ones which I consider the 
mnsjt effective.

ELIXIR OF DOOM 

(Concluded from page 111 ) 

A Frankenstein’s monster, it had 
killed its creator. 

Again Somers and Anne were si- 
lent, awed by their memories. The 
little flower box stood here before 
them. The moonlight through the 
window streamed brilliantly down 
upon it. 

Little arena. Small spread of caked 
dirt, with a fuzz of tiny grass and a 
forlorn geranium at its center. What 
amazing realms of smallness lay hid- 
den here ! The match still stood, with 
a tiny scratch in the dirt beside it. A 
few inches away, toward the gerani- 
um, the dirt was softer. There was 
a tiny broken mound. Somers’ mind 
swept back. A worm had poked it- 
self up there, and then wriggled away. 

He bent closer. Even now he could 
distinguish the body of Toro. A speck 
on the dirt near the upright rnatch- 
stick. 

And as he stared, he saw two tiny 
black ants struggling over the ridges 
of the dirt. They came upon the tiny 
speck. They stood for a moment pick- 
ing it apart. And then they carried 
it away.
