green-faced ones rests the Screece 
gem. Some say it's a fabulous dia-

ruby . . . but Caine guessed 
it was death itself.

High above the ivet plains and muggy 
jungles, above the slick rocks and shiny 
leaves, rests a temple. Like most shrines of 
ancient order its narrowing spires point to 
the sky. Men, Venusian men, walk quietly 
through the'restricted- labyrinth of this tem- 
ple, green fingers webbed beneath the long 
sleeves of their gray capes; green faces ex- 
pressionless beneath the sanctity of their 
gray hoods. There is movement, and these 
caped men circle a silver orb that lies in 
dead center of the golden walls. They pace, 
each flat step a soundless motion. The green 
fingers unmesh, spread, and come together 
again. "Screece,” says a flute-like voice. 
"Screece," says another. The silver orb rests 
like a cloudy fist-sized tinsel globe, un- 
sparkling, while a dozen minds search out 
through the vastness of Venus, probing for 
the cores of evil and purity. Feet pace, faces 
are immobile, and through the thick air 
comes a shrill rising scream from the throat 
of a giant black cat with deep orange eyes. 
The motion ceases, lidless stares meet. 
"Grith?” pronounces one. ''Grith?” pro- 
nounces another. And the pacing continues, 
while green lips quirk the slightest bit. 
Minds search . . , 

I T WAS that season when the jungle of 
Venus turned into a vapid, steaming 
swamp. Sleet buds glistened like long, 
thin snakes, and leaves hung limp and wet 
from the vine-trees. Nicholas Caine felt the 
sweat prickle upon his forehead and slide 
down the sides of his face. Fairchild, he 
noticed, was sweating, too, so that the man's 
shirt had turned dark, and the close-clipped 
gray hair curled on his head. Only the 
woman still looked fresh in her white shirt 
and shorts. 

She was standing beside Caine’s jetcopter, 
drinking plain Scotch from a silver glass. 
Her husband, Fairchild, was drinking, too, 
as he sat silently in a folding chair beneath 
the tip of the ship’s left wing. 

This is going to be a sweet thing, Caine 
thought, it really is. 

The air was dead of breeze, and soggy 
clouds hung above them like an immense 
stifling blanket. The man stared at his knees 
and the woman swirled the Scotch in her 
glass. Caine kept liis palms flat against the 
arm rests of his chair. 


He watched the woman closely. There was 
too much brightness inside of her, too much 
nervousness, as though she were burning in- 
side and she had to keep moving, laughing, 
insulting, enticing, because she was alive 
with that burning, and she couldn’t stop. It 
wasn’t the liquor, Caine knew, because they 
had just started that, a few minutes after 
he had brought the ship down. 

They were approximately four-hundred 
miles from the Colony, and in the wild 
stretches of this Venusian jungle, four- 
hundred miles was like the distance from 
day to night. Here was the dark, the strange, 
the weird and the wild. 

Kiitz birds screamed in the distance, and 
their sound was like the sound a man makes 
when he is touched by fire. A thick, muddy 
river went over a cliff above and behind 
them, hitting transparent rocks with a steady 
crashing noise that thrummed against 
Caine’s ears like thunder in a distant sky. 

Teewh birds with black wings and curling 
yellow beaks came out of the sultry sky and 
skimmed the tips of the trees surrounding 
the clearing. They screeched when they dove, 
and they kept harmony with the unseen sta- 
tionary kiitz birds. A chilling, nerve-rack- 
ing harmony. 

‘^TTTON’T you have a drink with us?” 

VV said the woman, her teeth white be- 
tween her smiling lips. 

"Thank you, no,” Caine said. The woman 
tipped her head and watched him. Her eyes 
were very blue and they mocked Caine and 
taunted him, while her husband just sat 
there, drinking and watching his bare knees. 

This could go to pieces in a hurry, Caine 
decided, and he rubbed his palms against 
the arms of the chair. 

Because, on the other hand, the husband 
was too quiet, too brooding, too deliberate!) 
unseeing of the way his wife played with 
Caine, with her eyes and her movements. 

Her legs, Caine noticed, were the kind 
that would look well bare, as they were, 
or in nylon beneath a skirt, and she had 
rather full hips, although not too full. Her 
breasts, Caine could see, were well enough 
developed. 

She bent to rub a finger against her 
left knee. "Are there insects in this part of 
the jungle?” she asked Caine.

WHERE THE GODS DECIDE 


"Some.” 

"But no grith cats?” she said, straighten- 
ing. 

"Not here,” Caine said. 

"Just where we’re going tomorrow?” 

"Yes.” Caine looked back to the man. 
He was about fifty, Caine judged, at least 
twenty years older than the woman. His face 
was lean and sad, and there were thin lines 
traveling out from the corners of his eyes 
and mouth that contrasted with the youthful 
cut of his wiry hair. 

These two had come to Caine because his 
reputation in the Colony was established. 
He had been flying tourists into the jungle 
for more than three years, and while he 
could not predict all of this country, he at 
least knew the general traits of those sec- 
tions within a reasonable radius of the 
Colony. 

"Did you ever shoot a grith cat?” the 
woman asked, looking at Caine over her 
glass. 

"No,” said Caine. 

"But you’ve heard that they’re pretty hor- 
rible and dangerous?” 

"Yes.” Caine wiped a hand at the sweat 
on his forehead. The woman was working 
at the cats, her eyes shifting to look at her 
husband with every word, to see how he 
was reacting. So far he had done nothing, 
said nothing, only sat there and drank. 

However, the cats were not the reason the 
couple were in the Venusian jungle. Hunt- 
ing animals was a dead sport for them, 
something done in the past and something 
which had become boring. 

They were looking for bigger game now. 
The Screece gem. And they had flown all 
the way from Earth to Mars, from Mars to 
Venus, to find it. The Screece gem was a 
myth, Caine was certain, a bit of fantasy 
out of ancient Venusian lore. But they paid 
him well for the trip, and he would ask no 
questions. 

The woman stayed with the cats. "How 
big are these grith cats, Mr. Caine?” 

"Eight to ten feet long,” Caine said. 
"About like a large horse.” 

"Only they’re cats, with the claws and 
the fangs and all.” 

"Essentially.” 

Caine felt himself tightening inside a 
little. The woman was trying to break 


through her husband’s armor, because 
somew'here, sometime, he must have had 
trouble hunting a cat-like animal. Tiger. Or 
panther. The Martian frynx, perhaps. But 
she had not found her target, yet. 

The man raised his head and spoke for 
the first time since they had landed. "How 
far away is this temple, would you say, Mr. 
Caine?” 

"Fifty miles,” Caine said. 

"How close to it can we land?” 

"Eight or ten miles, I imagine.” 

"Can’t we get closer than that?” the man 
asked. 

"I don’t think so,” Caine said. "The tem- 
ple is on top of a fairly sheer rise of land, 
and I can’t put the ship down there. The 
nearest clearing we’ll find will be about 
eight or ten miles away.” 

Mrs. Fairchild walked to her chair and 
sat down. "That means, then, that we’ll 
have to go through that much country where 
the cats are?” 

Caine didn’t answer, and the man re- 
turned to gazing at his knees. Time moved 
slowly in the thick wet jungle. 

."Show Mr. Caine your scar, Charles,” the 
woman said, her voice sudden out of the 
silence. 

Fairchild picked up his glass from the 
arm of his chair and held it tightly in front 
of his waist. The muscles along his bare 
forearms were ridged and his knuckles paled 
as he held the glass. 

"Don’t be bashful,” the woman said, 
smiling. "I’m sure Mr. Caine would like to 
see what a cat can do.” 

She looked at Caine as though she were 
about to tell him a delightfully domestic 
story that had been, until now, nurtured be- 
tween just her husband and her. "This was 
a leopard, Mr. Caine. A long vicious leopard. 
Mr. Fairchild, you see, didn’t hit him right, 
and so he got Charles from about here,” she 
tapped herself just below the neck, "to 
here.” She touched her waist. "It’s a long 
scar, Mr. Caine. Isn’t it, Charles? About 
three inches wide, and. . . .” 

The man brought his glass down against 
the arm of the chair. "Shut up, Janet. I’ll 
tell you nicely. Just shut up!” 

"Charles," she said, blinking in exagger- 
ated surprise. "I just wanted to tell Mr. 
Caine, because he’s hunted, too, and while

I don’t know if these grith cats are anything 
like leopards. . 

The man’s eyes had become wide and 
angry. "I won’t tell you again, Janet.” 

"I’m sorry, Charles.” She smiled at him 
assuringly and blinked again. "We’re just 
excited about tomorrow, I guess, aren’t we?" 

Fairchild returned his stare to his glass, 
noticed it was empty, and filled it. 

"Can’t I interest you in a drink, yet, Mr. 
Caine?” Mrs. Fairchild said. 

■ Not right now,” Caine said. 

Oh.” Her voice pouted. "But I think 
we should celebrate. Here Charles and I 
have come all this way to find the Screece 
gem, and we’re sitting within fifty miles of 
it, and I think we all ought to celebrate.” 

F airchild spoke to Caine without rais- 
ing his head. "Maybe Mr. Caine doesn’t 
really believe in the existence of the Screece 
gem. Do you, Mr. Caine?” he said, looking 

“P- 

Caine took a cigarette from a package in 
his shirt. "I’m just paid to get you to a tem- 
ple, not to think.” 

"You’re evading the question,” Fairdiild 
said. His eyes were narrow now, and a bit 
glaxed. 

Caine lit his cigarette and blew smoke 
into the damp air. He kept his voice non- 
committal. "I’ve heard about it. Everybody 
in the Colony has heard about it.” 

"Correction,” said Fairchild. "Everybody 
in the System has heard about it.” 

"It’s a very popular myth,” Caine agreed. 
’The man stood up. "It is not a myth, Mr. 
Caine. It exists and it’s in that temple, do 
you hear me? 'There is no dammed myth 
about it, just cold hard fact, and I’m going 
to find it and take it out of there! Is that 
clear?” 

Caine watched tlie man’s taut figure. He 
inhaled his cigarette. "I told you, Mr. Fair- 
child, I’m just paid to fly the ship and I’m 
not paid to think. I’m responsible for getting 
you to the temple. 'That’s all. 

"Listen,” Fairchild said, crossing to Caine 
and reaching for the front of Caine’s shirt. 
Don’t get insolent with me. . 

Caine slapped the man’s hand away, 
"Charles!” the woman said. 

The man blinked and touched his slapped 
hand against his chest. "Sorry, Mr. Came,” 


he said, finally. "Didn’t mean to fly off that 
way. Little nervous, you see. All that time in 
space, searching around this way. We’re just 
this close, and I’m getting too nervous.” He 
turned back to his chair and sat down. His 
face became very sad again, and the lines 
about his mouth and eyes seemed deeper. 

The woman laughed lightly. "You don’t 
want to pay any attention to Charles when 
he’s this way,” she said to Caine. "It’s just 
that this means so much to him, finding the 
Screece gem. It’s w'orth the wealth of the 
System, thej- say, and so Charles has to have 
it, Mr. Caine. Because he hasn’t got any 
more money.” 

"For heaven’s sake, Janet,” the man 
pleaded. 

"Are you ashamed of being poor?” she 
asked with false concern. She stood up and 
began pacing back and forth, and Caine 
noticed the easy way she moved, her hips 
swaying, the muscles of her long legs rip- 
pling. "No, he’s not ashamed of being 
poor,” she said, looking at Caine. "He’s 
afraid of it, aren’t you, Charles?” 

Fairchild tipped his glass to his lips, and 
when he brought it down, Caine could see 
that it was empty again. 

The man refilled the glass and held it in 
front of him, looking into it, as though he 
might find another world there, a peaceful 
world, where there weren’t any cats or beau- 
tiful women w'ith reddish hair, a world 
where there might be peace and no fear. He 
raised the glass, trying to taste of that world. 
His eyes were getting filmy. 

"I’ll tell you why he’s afraid of being 
poor, Mr. Caine,” the woman went on. "It’s 
because not only is Charles a yellow punk 
when it comes to cats, but he’s frightened 
of losing his wife, aren’t you, Charles?” 

Caine felt himself tensing under tlie cut- 
ting lilt of the woman’s voice. He was ob- 
serving something, he knew, that should 
have been contained in the seal of marital 
privacy. But here he was, caught in the mid- 
dle of it, while the woman swung back and 
forth, and the man seemed to crumple fur- 
ther into his 'chair, hanging on to the glass 
of Scotch, as though that were all he had 
left to hang on to. 

And tomorrow they had ten miles of grith 
country to span on foot. Sweet, Caine re- 
peated to himself, really sweet.

«^HARLES, you see,” the woman said, 
Kj stopping and turning to Caine, 
"thinks the only way he can hold me is with 
money. And now he’s put every penny he 
had left into this hunt so that he can find 
the Screece gem and keep his lovely wife. 
And do you know what, Mr. Caine?” She 
placed her hands gently on her hips, and 
Caine’ could see the faintest swinging move- 
ment in them. "He’s right, you see.” 

Caine remained very silent. 

“He has to find the Screece gem,” the 
woman said, smiling whitely, "or lovely 
Janet is gone, slipped right out of his hands. 
And Charles is just a poor little sheep with 
gray hair and a two inch scar, who’ll be cold 
and alone, while Janet — ” 

"Stop it, damn it!” Fairchild said, but 
he didn’t get up and his voice was thick. 

" — while Janet,” the woman said, her 
voice even and relentless, "will be sleeping 
with someone else who can afford her, and 
poor old Charles will shiver in his damned 
freezing bed, all alone, thinking about that, 
wondering who it is, burning up his ancient 
jealous liver!” The woman whirled to face 
her husband. 

The man tightened both hands around his 
glass, and Caine could see the whiteness 
about his mouth. ’The woman began to laugh, 
a soft, pealing laugh that got into Caine’s 
brain because of the very softness of it. 

She valked back to her chair and lifted 
her own glass. Her laughter stopped while 
she drank, and then it started again. She 
turned to look at her husband, and her eyes 
danced and her lips curved. Her body shook 
with the laughter. 

"Who do you think it’ll be?” she asked 
her husband. "If you don’t find the gem?” 
She turned to Caine. "Mr. Caine, do you 
have any money? I mean, perhaps you 
wouldn’t need as much money as Charles. 
I might make some compensation for veril- 
ity, you know.” 

Caine disregarded her. "Mr. Fairchild, w'e 
have some rugged country to cover tomor- 
row. This is your party, of course, but if 
you keep on drinking. . .” 

“If I keep on drinking?” 

Caine examined the man’s eyes and his 

6 — Planet Stories — July 


slack mouth. "Nothing,” Caine said. "Noth- 
ing.” At least, he decided, the Scotch might 
stop the needling and the pressure for the 
man. He deserved that much, perhaps. 

"You didn’t answer me, Mr. Caine,” the 
woman said. "About you and me. I’d like 
you to answer, so that my husband knows 
before he falls out of his chair, you see.” 

“I think we all ought to get some sleep,” 
Caine said quietly. 

"Mr. Caine, really? So sudden? I’d have 
to check your bankbook first, of course. Al- 
though if you give me your word. . .” 

"If you don’t mind,” Caine said, his voice 
harsh, "I’d like to be left neutral in what- 
ever you and Mr. Fairchild might have in 
conflict.” 

"Oh,” she said. "Well, that’s just because 
you haven’t seen the full potential. Let me 
show you what you’d be getting for your 
money — the way Charles saw it.” She raised 
her glass again, drank, and stood up to cross 
to the ship. She climbed the ladder to the 
cabin, very gracefully, and touched the 
switch of the radio. Music pealed into the 
warm air. 

It was minor music, issuing from the Col- 
ony station, music that had been taken from 
the native Venusian melodies. It had been 
converted and fitted to the heavy rhythm of 
Earth’s ancient Africa, and it seemed sud- 
denly to become a part of this jungle of 
Venus. 

The woman stood in the doorway, and 
then she moved down the ladder, as though 
it were one sliding motion. She remaineed 
there, her back against the silver metal of 
the ship, swaying her hips, moving her 
shoulders. 

"I was a dancer, you see, Mr. Caine. I 
worked in a very expensive club in Habrill, 
on Mars. I was very popular and very good, 
and sweet Charles took me away from it all, 
didn’t you, Charles?” 

Fairchild, Caine could see, was having 
trouble focusing his eyes, but the rhythmic 
music was heavy in the air and it beat against 
the ears, and Caine knew that the man was 
aware of what was happening. 

The woman began moving easily toward 
Caine, her movement a practised swinging 
motion of hips and shoulders. "This is what 
Charles took me awav from, Mr. Caine, by 
the gentle touch of gold,” she said. " 'Come

■with me,’ he said, and he fitted diamonds 
to my ears and rings to my fingers. 'Let me 
take you away from the damned searching 
eyes of every man on Mars. Let me hide you, 
so no one can see you or touch you, but me, 
and I’ll give you ^1 I own.’ Isn’t that right, 
Charles?” she said, looking at him with nar- 
row gleaming eyes. 

The man lifted his glass and slowly 
drained it. He let it fall to the ground with 
a breaking crunch, while the woman kept 
time with the rhythm, with her hips and 
her shoulders, slight swinging motions that 
only intimated. 

"Only now,” the woman said, "poor 
Charles doesn’t have anything more to give, 
and so here I go again. . . .” 

She raised her hands over her head and 
cracked her palms together. Her hips swung 
and her shoulders shook. She caught her fin- 
gers in her hair, her teeth white and biting, 
while her whole body shivered. It was a rip- 
pling gyration of muscle and pink skin, 
building, furious. 

Fairchild pushed himself out of the chair. 
His eyes were wild and vacant. "Don’t. . .” 
he said, and his words were meshed together 
so that it was a hoarse sound, full of anguish. 

The woman laughed, a wild laugh that 
blended with the music and the frenzied 
movement of her body. She whirled and 
slapped her hands together and her body 
quivered. 

The man staggered a step forward. "Janet, 
don’t, please . . .” He fell forward, sprawl- 
ing over the ground. Gradually, the woman 
ceased her movement, while her laughter 
rang through the wet jungle. 

The gray-caped figures hold motionless 
tvround the muddy stiver orh. A green head 
cocks. Another. The golden ivdls encase 
them, and only a circular opening near a tip 
of a spire brings in dim light atid a little of 
the wispish outside vapor. Fingers disengage 
and a green extends from a gray cape. The 
hand sweeps in a downward slice, splitting 
by symbol, purity from evil. A second hand 
imitates, A third. A dozen. Voices flute to 
the cloudy orh. A cat snarls. Minds probe. 

T he light was dimming, and she was a 
dark curving figure, standing over the 
crumpled figure of the man. "The music 


pounded relentlessly. Caine stood up. 

"Each time I make one of these trips,” 
he said, looking at the motionless form of 
Fairchild, "I promise myself it’ll be the 
last, and I’m promising myself again, right 
now.” 

The woman stood silent, and there was 
just her smiling mouth and the white teeth 
and the reddish hair. "But this one isn’t over, 
yet, Mr. Caine. We still have a long way 
to go.” Her eyes danced. 

"That’s right, Mrs. Fairchild,” v^aine 
said, bending to lift the man. "Unfortu- 
nately, that’s right.” 

He picked the man up while the woman 
watched, and he carried him to the ship. 
He climbed to the cabin, working against the 
surprising weight of the smaller man. For 
his age, Fairchild w-as a very tough, sinewy 
man who looked as though he had spent 
most of his life fighting through strange 
and varied wilds, constantly in seardi of new 
adventures and thrills. 

Caine laid tlie man across a bunk built 
into the rear of the ship’s cabin. The tip end 
of the wide scar was visible now, showing 
above Fairchild’s open shirt, and the thin 
lines about the eyes and mouth were like 
written entries in his face, telling of too 
much Scotch and perhaps too much of the 
reddish-haired woman. All that he lacked, 
Caine thought wryly, was the empty bank 
account to show the price he had paid for 
the love of the devilish woman. 

Caine straightened and walked back 
through the cabin, snapping off the radio. 

He jumped to the ground. The light was 
very dim now, and the woman was only an 
outline. The screams of kiitz birds were in 
the air again, and in the distance, the thrum- 
ming monotony of the falls. 

"You can use the cabin with your hus- 
band, Mrs. Fairchild,” Caine said briskly. 
"I’ll get some blankets and sleep out here.” 

"Aren’t there animals?” 

"Not around here,” Caine said. "I’ll make 
a fire. If you want something to eat I’ll get 
it out of the cabin for you.^’ 

"No, thank you, Mr. Caine,” the woman 
said, sitting down in her chair. "I’ll just 
enjoy the rest of my drink, if you don’t 
mind.” 

"It’s up to you,” Caine said shortly. He 
was very careful to keep his eyes away from 


WHERE THE GODS DECIDE 


her. You handled a woman like that best, 
he knew, by keeping your eyes away from 
her. 

He gathered wood from beneath the wet 
outer layer of the jungle floor. He bent to 
light the fire just as the darkness enveloped 
the clearing. The flames flickered and licked 
upward, sending their shifting yellow light 
into the surrounding foliage. 

Caine straightened from the fire. 

"Dd you like my dance?” the woman 
asked, softly. 

"I didn’t see it for your husband, Mrs. 
Fairchild,” Caine said, and he returned to 
the ship where he got several blankets. He 
placed them near the fire. 

"He’s not around now,” the woman said. 

Caine looked at her finally. "He is as far 
as I’m concerned.” 

"You’re so noble, Mr. Caine.” 

"I’m not anything,” Caine said. “I’m just 
a guide who gets paid for taking people 
where they want to go. Nothing more, do 
you understand, Mrs. Fairchild?” 

"No,” she said, smiling at him. 

Caine walked to his chair and sat down. 
"We have a tough day ahead of us, Mrs. 
Fairchild, and we’ll need all the strength 
we have to get through that stretch of jun- 
gle. This is a different jungle than you’ve 
seen before. Venus breeds some terrible 
country, and where we’re going is that kind 
of country. I haven’t been there myself, so 
I can’t even predict what it’ll be like. But 
I’ve circled it in the ship and it’s thick and 
alive. I don’t trust it. So you can stay up, 
if you like, and I’ll be glad to stay awake my- 
self, but I’d advise some sleep right now.” 

Mrs. Fairchild stood up slowly, her fingers 
drifting over her waist. "I’ll tell you, Mr. 
Caine. You’re not the kind of man I like 
to argue with. I’ve had just enough liquor to 
feel perfectly agreeable to anything, any- 
way. So I’ll get ready for bed, but I’m sorry 
you didn’t enjoy my dance. Let’s do this. 
You wait while I get ready, and then we’ll 
have one nightcap together, a sort of dancing 
nightcap. Are you interested, Mr. Caine?” 

Caine lit a cigarette slowly, watching the 
blaze of his lighter. He snapped the lighter 
shut. "I’m interested in both you and your 
husband, Mrs. Fairchild.” 

"To hell with my husband,” she said, her 
teeth showing between her lips. She lifted 


her glass and drank all that was in it. "Relax, 
Mr. Caine,” she said, walking toward the 
ship. "Enjoy yourself.” 

Caine noticed that the liquor had taken 
hold of the way she walked, so that she 
swayed a little, but there was still the grace 
there and the swing, and it was hard to dis- 
regard. 

I hope she doesn’t come out of there, 
Caine thought. I hope she just falls asleep 
and leaves me alone, and that tomorrow goes 
very quickly and smoothly. 

B ut when Caine had watched the flames 
lick at the settling night for a few min- 
utes and had finished his cigarette, he heard 
the sound again. The sound of music, muf- 
fled by the silver body of the ship. Wilder 
now, with heavier drums, seasoned into a 
more biting sound by the night and the flick- 
ering flames. Caine was aware of the blood 
in his veins and the pulse in his temples. 

All at once, the door of the cabin was 
kicked open and the music rose in the air. 
The woman stood in the doorway, her hands 
gripping the silver frame tightly. She wore 
a black nightgown, made of shimmering 
stuff that was as thin as the fine mist in the 
air. Her hair had been let down and it fell 
over her shoulders and her back. Her feet 
were bare and very white beneath the black 
gown. 

She stood motionless, her fingers tight 
against the frame, as though holding herself 
against the music. The melody disappeared 
then, and there was only the drums, rolling, 
and finding a punctuation that became all 
that existed in the night. The woman leaped 
from the doorway and she touched the 
ground, wriggling. Her feet were wide- 
spaced and her hands searched through her 
hair, lifting it from the nape of her neck. 
She bent forward suddenly, so that her hair 
was a reddish swirl against the light of the 
leaping flames. 

She straightened slowly, one hand sliding 
her hair back, so that Caine could see her 
eyes dancing with her body, and she began 
moving toward him, shoulders swinging, 
hips pivoting. Caine kept his hands tight 
against the arms of his chair, his eyes nar- 
row. TTie woman was a writhing movement 
beneath the black veil-like gown. She twisted 
and whirled and finally, she stopped in front

of Caine, chin high, one hand still half- 
thrust through the soft thick hair. Her eyes 
glowed. 

"Nightcap,” she said, her voice breath- 
less. 

Caine shifted carefully in his chair. "I’m 
not thirsty,” he said. 

The woman’s hand snapped from her hair, 
and the relaxed suppleness of her body 
tightened. 

"I remember a man,” Caine said through 
his teeth, "who’s a dozen yards away, sleep- 
ing in the protection of alcohol, because a 
cheap burlesque queen is drawing out his 
blood until he’s damned near dead. I can 
see through the pink skin, Mrs. Fairchild, 
and what I see makes me sick. You don’t 
interest me at all, and you never will because 
I don’t like the sight of hate and selfishness 
and just plain rottenness.” 

She struck him across the face with one 
hand and then the other. The fury burned 
in her eyes and her body trembled with it. 
She struck him again and again, and Caine’s 
face bled where a ring ripped his skin. 

He sat very still, his hands remaining 
against the chair arms. "You’ve just lost 
yourself a boy, Mrs. Fairchild. Put your 
clothes on, we’re flying back to the Colony. 
You can find yourself somebody else for 
this, because I’ve had enough.” 

He started to rise, but she put one hand 
against his chest, and the fury was gone out 
of her eyes, and there were tears instead. 

"Please,” she said, and Caine could hear 
the tears going into her voice. "I’m sorry. 
I’m awfully sorry. Let me talk to you first, 
please.” She knelt to the ground and watched 
Caine while thin tears ran down her cheeks. 

"About what, Mrs. Fairchild?” Caine 
said coldly. 

"I don’t know why I did what I did,” she 
said, touching at the tears. "Too much 
Scotch, I think. Only I’m still a dancer and 
it’s in my blood. It isn’t cheap burlesque, 
Mr. Caine. It’s something deep inside me 
and I can’t help it.” 

"Nice trait,” Caine said, "for a man’s 
wife.” 

"I had that coming. I’ve got a lot coming, 
only the resentment for his drinking, the 
way he’s tried to own me, keeps coming out 
and I want to hurt him. I know it isn’t right, 
but it’s what I do and I want to stop doing 


it. He’s worried, and it comes out with what 
he says and what he does, and so I fight him. 
He thinks if he doesn’t find this gem, he’s 
going to lose me.” 

"Isn’t he?” Caine asked, his eyes thin. 

"No,” she said quietly. "I’m frightened 
of him and I feel alone with him. But I 
won’t leave him.” 

"Like I told you,” Caine said, “I’m just 
a hired man. What my customers think or 
do between themselves is none of my busi- 
ness.” 

"You’re not that cold,” she said, looking 
into his eyes. 

"I’m that cold.” 

She shook her head stubbornly. "Be kind 
to me. You can. For just this one moment, 
when I’m not alone or afraid, when there’s 
just this one moment before tomorrow — 
when it starts all over again.” 

Caine didn’t answer, but he relaxed in his 
chair slightly and leaned back. 

She smiled at him and it was a warm sim- 
ple smile with all the hardness and sarcasm 
erased. "Would you have one drink with 
me? One small drink to seal the night up, so 
maybe you won’t remember me so badly, 
so maybe you’ll think I’ve got some heart 
and human feelings?” 

Caine waited, watching her shiny eyes. 
"One drink,” he said. 

She smiled and stood up, returning to the 
side of the ship where Fairchild had set up 
his portable bar. She poured two glasses, 
and while Caine watched her, he noticed 
that in her straight, motionless posture, the 
animal litheness had disappeared. She was 
very simple — and naive-looking, and when 
she returned, he saw that the tears were still 
wet on her face. 

She handed him a glass, and she held her 
own in the air. "A trite toast — here’s to two 
people who met in the Venus night. . . 
briefly.” 

"Two people,” Caine repeated, lifting his 
own glass. The Scotch burned down his 
throat. 

She kneeled again and smiled at him. 
Caine noticed then that the music was still 
beating into the night ar, and that the black 
gown was stll very thin. He turned his glass 
up again, to hurry through the drink. Even 
in her simplicity and tears he didn’t trust 
himself. 


*3 


WHERE THE GODS DECIDE 


The Scotch seemed to take hold of his 
blood and he could feel it racing in his 
veins. 

He lifted the glass a third time, and 
the hand that held it seemed suddenly de- 
tached from his own movement. A singing 
began in his head and then disappeared, and 
when he looked at her, the smiling lips were 
redder and the shining teeth were whiter. 
The music pulsated in his head, seeming to 
beat against his brain. 

"What . . . ?” he began, and his voice 
was thick. He shook his head and looked 
at his glass. It fell out of his hand. 

"A little witch’s potion,” she said, rising. 
"Something from the Martian caldron. 
Quick and oh, so effective.” 

He fought the feeling that caught hold 
of him. His brain seemed to deaden until 
there was only the drums inside his head, 
and his senses became alive and burning. He 
could see her before him, and she began 
to sway back and forth, her hands moving in 
front of her face. He caught hold of the chair 
arms to keep his own hands from reaching 
out. 

He tried to cling to reason, but his hands 
wanted to escape. The flames of the fire 
flickered somewhere in the distance, and in 
front of him the black-covered body began 
to move in rippling shivers. The moving 
pink hands rose in the air, and there was 
a shimmer of concealed muscles, dancing, 
dancing. 

He clung to the chair, gritting his teeth, 
but the drums pounded at his senses, over 
and over, and the lips smiled and the white 
teeth shone and the pink body moved in 
time with the drums. 

"Not yet?” he heard her say, somewhere 
far away. 

And the body turned slowly, convoluting 
in a shimmering dance of thin blackness. 

Caine lost his grip on the chair, and he 
was moving his hands. He heard the laugh- 
ter, high in the air, stinging his ears and he 
couldn’t stop himself. He was listening to 
the laughter when his fingers touched skin, 
and there was only blackness after that.

H e awoke as a boot caught the side of 
his head. He rolled across the ground, 
the pain exploding inside his head. 'Hie boot 
found him again. Another time, above his 
eyes. He moaned, trying to make his muscles 
work, but it was as though he were still 
caught in a nightmare. 

"Filthy damned swine,” he heard, and 
his eyes watched a fist come out of the misty 
air to smash against his cheek. He rolled 
again, burying his face against the ground, 
trying to hide, to protect himself until he 
could find his senses and his coordination. 

"You’ll kill him.” It was a woman’s voice, 
saying this, a lilting feminine voice that was 
very, very familiar. Caine tensed himself, 
waiting for the next blow. 

"Get up,” a man said. 

Caine felt the boot against his legs. He 
turned over slowly and pulled himself to a 
sitting position. He shook his head, but the 
thick mist that was in the morning air 
seemed to have gotten into his brain. His 
arms and legs felt as though lead had been 
poured into his veins. 

Slowly it came back to him. The woman. 
The Scotch. He searched the fog-filled area 
in front of him. Fairchild, his mouth an ugly 
line, watched him and in his hand was 
Caine’s pistol. The woman was behind Fair- 
child, still in the black gown, and Caine 
could see that it was torn. 

"I’d kill you right now,” Fairchild said, 
his voice hoarse with rage, "but I want that 
gem. Get up.” 

"Darling,” the woman said to her hus- 
band, while her eyes danced at Caine. "He’s 
such a mess.” 

Caine tried to swallow and even that was 
difficult. Every part of his body had been 
taken hold of by the drug that had been 
put into his liquor, and each movement was 
a task he was certain he couldn’t complete. 
He raised a hand slowly to his face and his 
fingers came away sticky. 

"Get up!” Fairchild growled, his eyes 
vicious thin slits. 

Caine got to his knees and fell flat again. 
He clutched at the ground, waiting for the

crushing boot. It came, and he tried again. 
He got to his knees the second time and 
then, inch by inch, ne stood up. For a mo- 
ment it seemed as though his head were 
floating awa from his shoulders, and he 
looked uown at his body, thinking that what 
he saw curely belonged to someone else, a 
limp, ragged body, cut and bruised with no 
clotnes. He was falling again. 

Fairchild caught Gune’s arm and jerked 
him upright. "I’ll give you two minutes to 
get your damned clothes on, Caine, and get 
behind the controls of that ship." 

He looked at Fairchild stupidly. The man 
shook him. CaLie turned around and 
searched for his clothes beside the dead fire. 
He staggered and groped, and twice, black- 
ness covered his eyes and he went to his 
knees. 

Finally, he stood, weaving, clothed hap- 
hazardly, and he was vaguely aware that 
blood was sliding down his chin, dripping 
onto his jacket. He touched the blood with 
a finger and it didn’t mean anythii^ to him. 

The man turned to his wife, '"nie same 
goes for you. Get into the cabin!” 

"Charles," she pleaded. "He made me 
drink so much." 

"Go on!" Fairchild said, waving the pis- 
tol. 

She smiled crookedly and walked toward 
the ship. The mist lay over the jungle so 
thickly that the ship, not more than ten or 
twelve yardi away, was barely visible. Caine 
heard the door of the cabin opening and clos- 
ing. 

Fairchild pointed the gun at Caine’s 
stomach again. "You’d better watch every 
damned step you take," he said. "This gun 
is going to stay on you until 1 get that 
Screece gem, and rhe only reason you're 
alive, you bloody louse, is because I have to 
have it. Do you understand?" 

Caine searched for his voice, and it came 
O- . thick and strained. "Won’t fly you. . .’’ 
He watched the man’s face whiten, and the 
gun trembled in Fairchild’s hand. Then the 
gun was swinging through the air and Caine 
watched it coming until it struck him above 
the eyes. 

W ATER dripped from his face and his 
chest, and he fought for air. His brain 
was a singing maize of pain, and the numb- 


ness in his arms and legs kept him riveted 
to the ground. He opened his eyes, finally, 
as he felt himself being dragged across the 
clearing. The rungs of the ladder leading 
to the ship’s cabin were against him. He 
moved his head and his teeth struck silver 
metal. His coordination was gone and he 
couldn’t tell what his movements were going 
to be. 

"Up ihe steps,” he heard Fairchild say 
behind him. 

He lifted his hands, fitting them around 
the rungs of the ladder, and he began to 
pull himself up. It was an inching effort. 
Blood got in his eyes, and his head whirled 
into far-away spins that had nothing to do 
with the movement of his body. He hung 
onto the ladder and climbed one rung, then 
another. He teetered near the top, and Fair- 
child pushed him into the cabin where he 
sprawled. 

He could hear Fairchild coming up be- 
hind him, and the door slammed shut. 

Caine rolled onto his back and looked 
up. She was standing over him in fresh 
wnite shorts and blouse. Her hair now was 
very neat and groomed, and her pink skin 
was lauiant. She smiled at him, her teeth 
showing very whitely. "You’re a pretty 
thing, Mr. Caine.” 

He knew he should have felt the rage 
then, the instinctive fury for w’hat she had 
done to him. But the drug had left him with 
nothing but enough reaction to try to fight 
for consciousness and strength. 

“Clean him up," Fairchild said. "Fast. 
Then we’re leaving.” 

The woman got soap and water from the 
rear of the cabin. S'ne washed Caine’s face, 
her fingers cruel against the cuts and 
swellings. She raked the cuts with stinging 
medicine, and Caine lay unmoving, trying 
to let time feed him new strength. She stood 
up, finally, looking at her husband. 

"All right,” Fairchild said. "Let’s go, 
Caine.” 

Caine looked at the man’s face, at the .set 
of his mouth. He looked at the gun and 
then at the man’s boots. He pulled himself 
up and staggered into the seat behind the 
controls. His movements on the controls 
were slow and rough. He looked at Fair- 
child once, as the jets fired into the fog- 
ladened air. "Can’t fly this way. No balance. 


WHERE THE GODS DECIDE 


coordination. Visibility’s rotten, I . . 

The man moved the pistol into Caine’s 
side. 

Caine faced the instrument panel, trying 
to keep from weaving. He moved his hands 
and felt tlie ship rising. He tried to keep 
the rise steady and gradual, but his hands 
jerked. The ship tipped and swung toward 
the side of the clearing. Thick vine-trees 
came out of the fog, and Caine forced the 
ship straight up, the jets roaring. The silver 
jetcopter swung back and forth, climbing, 
slipping, dropping. He couldn’t move the 
controls properly. 

The sound of the waterfall was in their 
ears then, and Caine jambed the ship to the 
opposite side. They touched the tops of the 
trees, and finally he brought it up enough 
to be over the jungle and the rods. 

Instinct gave Caine vague direction, and 
he kept his altitude exaggerated to insure 
against his faulty senses. 

"Some say the Screece gem is a dia- 
mond," the woman said, dreamily. "Some 
say it’s an emerald. Some say it’s a ruby. 
What do you say it is, Charles.^’’ 

Fairchild sat motionless, silent, in the seat 
beside Caine. He still held the pistol so that 
the muzzle pointed into Caine’s side. 

"Don’t try anything, Caine," he said. "I’ll 
smash us all to hell before I’ll give up." 

Caine flew the ship. 

"It’s romantic, isn’t it?” the woman said, 
from behind Caine. "The most valuable gem 
in the world, deep in the Venusian jungle, 
protected by the long, long cats, and my 
sweet Cnarles is going to get it for me. 
Bless you, Charles. You are an extraordinary 
husband. I hope the cats don’t get you.” 

Caine heard the words, but his brain was 
too slow and thick with the drug to under- 
stand the sharpness of her words. He only 
moved the controls, feeling the gun Fair- 
child held against him. In this condition, he 
knew that if he tried to fool Fairchild, the 
man — his nerves tightened the way they 
were — would not hesitate to pump the pistol 
into Caine’s body. 

Caine worked his fingers numbly. If only 
he could find his control, his response, . . 

They were approaching thee area where 
Caine thought the temple should be. "Some- 
where,” he said, and his tongue was clumsy 
as he tried to speak. "Somewhere.”

T he mist was like layers of soft tissue 
around the ship. The visibility was not 
much more than the length of the wings. 
He eased the ship down, slowly, foot by foot. 
A golden pike-shaped object appeared beside 
the right wing. Caine brought the ship up. 

He grinned, a sly sudden grin. "Temple,’* 
he said foolishly. "Couldn’t have hit it 
closer sober." He thought about the clever- 
ness of what he had just said, laughing over 
it inside, noticing with a queer detachment 
how his words came out as though he had 
been drinking. 'The damned drug, he 
thought, but the laughter came up through 
him and it echoed through the cabin. 

Caine felt the gun go hard against his 
side, the steel bruising his ribs. His laughter 
was cut short, as though a gag had been 
slammed across his mouth. "Can’t help. . .” 
he began. 

But Fairchild’s face was close to his own. 
"I’ll make you laugh, Caine," the man whis- 
pered furiously. "I’ll make you laugh over 
w'hat happened. You think about that, eh? 
You think about that, you bloody. . .” 

Vaguely, Caine knew the pistol had been 
pulled away from his ribs and was whipping 
toward 1 s arm. He tried to shift out of its 
way, but he caught it squarely. 'The pain 
paralyzed him and even the sound of his 
cry was caught by his teeth snapping to- 
gether. The ship wavered and slid down- 
ward. 

"You stupid fool!” the woman screamed 
at her husband. 

Caine felr himself sliding out of his seat, 
the pain throbbing. He caught himself and 
reached for the controls with his good hand. 
But he only half-balanced the ship before 
he saw the tip of a vine-tree. He cut the 
jets. The trees were all around them, en- 
veloping them. He listened to the snap of 
the wings, heard distantly the splinter of 
glass, then nothing. 

He was looking at the shape of his arm, 
when he found his vision again. It was bent 
peculiarly. 

Whose crazy damned arm is that? he 
thought. 

Somehow his brain wanted him to laugh, 
to slap the comic twisted arm, lying in front 
of his eyes. The laughter was in his mouth 
and through his teeth and he raised his good 
hand.

"Oh, Lord,” he said, suddenly sober and 
feeling the blinding pain. He caught his 
good hand around a broken metal shaft, and 
the pain drew tears to his eyes. 

I think I’ll just go to sleep and die right 
now, he thought, wondering vaguely where 
his will and his strength had gone. Did they 
bleed out.^ he thought. Did they fall out 
when the man struck him? Did the woman 
draw them out last night, like a vampire 
draws out blood? 

Good night, he thought, dimly, dropping 
his hand from the shaft. Good-by. He 
closed his eyes. 

He was screaming, he knew, and some- 
where he heard a man’s voice say, "The 
gauze. The gauze.” It was a grating sound, 
like a metal wheel turning over gravel. He 
opened his eyes, and Fairchild was wrapping 
the gauze around his broken arm, splinted 
from a part of the cabin Duelling. 

Fairchild looked at him. There was a thick 
growth of gray whiskers, stubbling the 
man’s chin and cheeks, Cain noticed, and 
the man’s eyes were not sad any more. They 
appeared to burn, like his wife’s. He 
grinned at Caine and it was a humorless 
grin, his teeth set tightly together. "You’re 
lucky, Caine,” he said. "I set it instead of 
cutting it off.” 

Caine watched the grinning stubbled 
face. He felt a shudder trembling through 
his body, and the sweat on his face turned 
cold. I’m not Nic Caine, he thought. Surely 
not. I’m just a frightened, chilled man with 
no guts or reason. I am a rubber puppet, 
that’s who I am. Pull the strings, Mr. Puppet 
Master. 

"Get up,” said Fairchild. 

"That’s right,” Caine mumbled, smiling 
crazily. 

He pushed himself up and stood swaying 
in the cabin of the broken ship. He looked 
around, his eyes suddenly fierce. "Is this 
twisted wreck my pretty silver ship?” he 
asked loudly. "Oh, no!” he said, and tried 
to kick at a splintered panel. 

He felt himself pitching forward, and he 
caught out his good hand, steadying him- 
self. The drug, the pain, he thought deep in 
his brain, my damned arm. 

But he was like two people, watching 
each other, shifting back and forth from 
one identity to another. Rational, irrational. 


laughing, crying. 

He looked at the woman. She was hud- 
dling near the rear of the cabin. Blood 
spilled in a thin line down the side of her 
face from a cut above her eyes. '"We’!! never 
get out,” she said. Her voice was a high- 
pitched sound with no change of tone in 
it. "We’ll never get out.” 

"Why don’t you dance for us?” Caine 
said, blinking with the brightness of his 
suggestion. 

"Move, Caine,” the man said, prodding 
Caine’s back. She’ll dance when I give her 
the gem.” 

Caine crawled slowly out of the cabin. 
The undercarriage had been smashed, and 
the cabin was level with the ground. It was 
like going into a sea of vapor when he got 
out of the ship. 

How long? he thought, looking at his 
splintered arm. How long would the drug 
hang onto his brain? This was not himself. 
This w'as a weak spinning scarecrow who 
was drunk on dope. 

Then the pain smashed into his awareness. 
It disappeared as suddenly. He was in 
agony, then there was only the foolish whirl- 
ing of his brain. He turned slowly, like a 
limp mannequin, searching the blankness of 
the mist. 

"Where am I” he said aloud. 

"About one mile from Heaven,” said 
Fairchild behind him, holding now a rifle 
from Caine’s cabin rack. "Janet?” the man 
said to the cabin. "Take one of those damn 
rifles. Mr. Caine is going to lead us to his 
happy end. The gem first,” he said to Caine. 
"Then you. I’ll let you touch it before you 
die.” 

'The woman came out of the cabin, a rifle 
in her hands. She pointed it at Fairchild. 
"We’ll never get out of here,” she repeated, 
in her sing-song tone. 

"Not without me,” Fairchild said quietly, 
looking at the pointed rifle. He turned his 
back to her. 

The woman’s face had lost its pink radi- 
ance, and it was white except where the 
blood trickled. 

"Let’s go, Caine,” Fairchild said. 

"I don’t know where to go,” Caine said 
stupidly. 

"Up,” Fairchild said. "Just lead the way 
up. I don’t need you to know where the tern-

pie is now. You got us much closer than 
we’d planned, you know. You’re just bait^ 
now, Caine. Bait for the cats. Remember the 
cats?” 

"I won’t go through that,” the woman 
said, staring at the mist around them. 

"All right,” Fairchild said. "Stay here 
and meet the cats alone. I’ll bring the gem 
back to you, if there’s anything left of you. 
But, by heck, you’re going to get it, do you 
hear me?” He faced her again. "You’re 
going to get that gem if I have to kill seven- 
teen cats, and Caine, and even you. Dead 
or alive, you’re going to get it, do you hear?” 

The woman was pale, sick-looking, and 
Caine tried to remember how she had looked 
the night before. It was too much effort. 

"Move,” said the man, prodding Caine. 
"Move, Mr. Caine.” 

IV 

C AINE moved, trying to find some hate 
to use on himself for letting the sight 
of the rifle in the man’s hands frighten him 
the way it did. But there was only a dull 
craziness within him, where the strength and 
nerve used to be. It was as though his steel 
had been melted and drained out of him by 
the drug. 

I'm like a fish, he thought, pushing 
through ihe foliage, a fish with a broken fin. 
Do cats like fish with broken fins? he won- 
dered. And the three of them were moving 
in a slow silent line through the Venusian 
wilds. 

The sounds were in Caine’s brain like a 
dozen records being played in a large echoing 
room. Teewh birds pointed their yellow 
beaks and came screaming at his head. The 
kiitz birds fluttered wildly out of the 
thickets, their frightened sound like the rake 
of giant fingernails across smooth slate. 

But there were other things in this part 
of the jungle. Soft, gelatinous phules, the 
size of a man’s hand, hung to the vine-trees, 
and when Caine passed them they shifted off 
the trees to his skin and began their search 
for juices out of his own body. He swept 
them away, one at a time, and more found 
him. 

"I have nothing left in my veins for you,” 
he said to one of them sticking to his waist. 
"Maybe warm tea?” 


Fairchild touched the rifle against his 
back, and Caine pushed the phule away. 

A snake-like trill wriggled in front of 
him, its purple and black skin glistening as 
though it had been drawn through oil. It 
was about four feet long and as thick as a 
heavy rope. Its never-closing eyes stared at 
Caine. "Hello, friend,” Caine said, reaching 
out his good arm. The trill slid away. 

That’s what I really am like, he decided, 
wondering when the pain would come shat- 
tering into him again. I am like the trill. I 
ought to lie down on the ground and start 
wriggling, instead of walking. 

The pain found him then, and his brain 
was cleared briefly of the veil of the drug. 
The pain lasted longer this time. Drug wear- 
ing off, he thought, only now I don’t want 
it to. And then he thought of the cats; the 
terrible cats, the horrible cats. . . . 

His brain spun and the veil dropped. 
What was I thinking about? he said to him- 
self. Cats? Was it the cats? Why? Cats are 
pretty, especially grith cats. They are black, 
like the spots on a leopard. And what makes 
me think of a leopard? I’ll ask the man be- 
hind me, he thought, and stopped. 

"Go on, Caine,” Fairchild whispered. 
"Go on, damn you.” 

Leopards? Leopards? Caine asked himself, 
and he pushed on through the growth, feel- 
ing the ground rising more steeply. 

Razor plants licked at his skin, until his 
flesh was slit finely in a dozen places. The 
gauze around his arm became a fuzzy mass, 
like rags. If I see a cat, Caine promised 
himself, I’ll take a splint off my arm and 
hit him over the head with it. 

The mist hung around them like a hungry 
shroud, eager to cloak everything on the 
planet with its muggy wetness. Then the 
growth lessened a bit, and Caine saw bare 
rock here and there. It was easier to move 
and he did not jar his arm as much, but 
somewhere in his brain an old knowledge 
told him that this would be certain grith 
territory, and every step now was a step 
closer to the black face with the orange eyes 
and sharp teeth. 

Caine felt himself growing weaker, and 
each motion was a building effort. The heat 
had risen, but there was no sweat on his face 
now, only a burning dryness. His head 
seemed to start its floating again, and he

thought for a moment that it might drift irp 
over the trees, like a balloon. 

The idea was very funny to him, and 
laughter grew inside of him. He griimed, 
feeling his stomach move with it, until sud- 
denly he was freezing his movement, laugh- 
ing into the mist-filled air, staring straight 
into the orange eyes of a grith cat. 

The laughter stopped in his mouth. He 
blinked once. The cat didn’t move. Fair- 
child and the woman, Caine knew, had 
halted behind him. The cat's eyes shown 
through the mist like fiery globes. I’ll pet 
him, Caine thought with great detachment, 
right on his black head, and then he’ll go 
away. 

The cat was motionless. 

Caine knelt slowly, looking straight into 
the cat’s eyes. It was about ten yards away. 

Caine turned to look at Fairchild. The 
man was on one knee, the rifle pointing at 
the cat’s head. The woman waited behind 
him, half-crouched, holding her rifle tight 
against her side. 

Caine looked back to the cat, moving his 
head slowly. He could see the great swishing 
tail, moving back and fortli, back and forth. 

Why doesn’t the man shoot? Caine asked 
himself. Why is he waiting this way? 

Time halted. 

Caine edged his look back to Fairchild. 
You crazy fool, he thought. You have the 
rifle in your hands, you. . . 

And then he saw’ the sweat dripping from 
the man’s face, the staring eyes, drained of 
their focus by fear. The man’s body was 
trembling, and Caine thought; he’s going 
to drop the rifle out of his hands, he's. . . 

T he woman screamed. "Kill him! Kill 
him — ’’ The rifle exploded in her hands 
and bullets whined through the air. Caine 
felt a hot sting in his shoulder. And the cat 
was a roaring, crazed thing that swept 
through the air, a flash of shining blackness. 

The air came apart with the sound of the 
rifle and the screams of the woman and the 
roaring of the cat. Caine waited, as though 
this were a dream he was watching. The cat 
had leaped straight for the woman, and she 
was tangled with the black and white claws 
now, so tliat Caine saw only a rolling, 
screaming mass. 

Then there was no more sound from the 


woman, just a broken, bleeding body, and 
the cat was crouching again, the black coat 
stippled with red, the orange eyes wild. 

Caine blinked, realizing that Fairchild 
was sprawled beside him, a bullet through 
his head, his hands just touching his unfired 
rifle. 

I can't do it, Caine thought, looking at 
the rifle. Too slow. I’ll have those claws in 
me before I can even touch it. 

Tlie cat hugged closer to the ground, its 
muscles bunching. 

I’ll try, Caine thought, and his hand was 
moving toward the rifle, slowly, like a float- 
ing feather, it seemed. Jump, he said si- 
lently to the cat. I can’t do it. 

"Grith?” sounded a flute-like voice. 

The cat was motionless. 

"Gritli?” 

The cat rose slowly and backed, tail 
swishing. Green hands slapped together, and 
the cat turned and disappeared. 

Caine placed his palms flat against the 
ground, propping hunself, and watched the 
approadiing figures. The mist seemed to be 
disappearing, and he could see more clearly 
the green skin and the large, unblinking 
eyes that looked out solemnly from beneath 
the hoods of the gray capes. 

Priests? Caine wondered. From the tem- 
ple? I didn’t know there were Venusians 
here, he said to himself, and although it was 
a very slight disclosure, as though he had 
suddenly learned that there were more men 
on Venus than women, he was astounded 
and impressed with it. "Well,” he said, 
grinning up at them as they stopped beside 
him. "Well, well.” 

He got to his knees and, still smiling, 
looked at his arm where the gauze had come 
loose. He shook his head in wonderment. He 
narrowed his eyes and examined the blood 
trickling from the surface wound in his 
shoulder. "Well, well,” he repeated, and 
stood up. 

The woman was a mangled shape on the 
wet ground, and the man lay very still. Caine 
looked Lam one to the other. ""Yes, yes,” he 
said, aloud. 

He turned to the gray<aped Venusians 
and found the somber eyes watching him, 
in their kindly way. One of them reached out 
and touched Caine’s shoulder above the 
broken arm. Others moved to the bodies of 


WHERE THE GODS DECIDE 


the man and woman and bent over them, 
making floating motions with their delicate 
green hands. 

Praying? Caine wondered, watching these 
motions. He shrugged. He couldn’t hold a 
thought very long. 

The mist was evaporating quickly. Caine, 
looking up, thought he could see a pointed 
outline. Tnen suddenly — high above — there 
was the golden temple, a shimmer of tower- 
ing spires of yellow beauty, splashed over 
by brilliant sunshine. 

Caine turned his face up to a strange sun, 
a blinding sun that sent its bright life down 
through the leaves. And Caine was aware 
that the caped figures were kneeling all 
around, praying in a jumble of voices, their 
hands stretching up to the infrequent visitor 
of light. 

What are they saying.^ Caine asked, smil- 
ing queerly. What is it they’re saying? 
Screece? The Sun? The most valuable gem 
on Venus? Is that what they worship in the 
golden temple? Caine looked at the man and 
then at the woman. Is that what they had 
come from Earth and from Mars to find? 
'The Sun? He felt the laughter starting in 
him again, as though it were someone else 
laughing. But his mouth widened and his 
teeth glistened in the sunlight, and he 
laughed long pealing laughter. 

"Here it is,” he said, staggering to the 
side of the man’s body. "Here’s your gem. 
Do you see it, Fairchild?” He pointed to 
the sky. "Give it to her,” he said, laughing 
through his words. "No? I’ll give it to her 
for you then. How’s that?” He turned and 
moved slowly to the woman, stumbling. 
"Here,” he said to the woman’s staring eyes. 
"Here it is, you see?” 


19 

He looked at her face, shadowed by a 
large leaf of a vine-tree. He reached up and 
jerked the leaf away so that the sunlight 
fell full on her white face. "There! Take 
it! From Charles, to you, through me. Isn’t 
it beautiful, so big, so brilliant, so . . .” The 
laughter was getting in the way of his 
words and he could feel tears going down 
his face. 

Pale green hands were holding him so 
that he wouldn’t fall. And they were moving 
him away toward the temple. Caine looked 
at the large kindly eyes around him, feeling 
the hands guiding him. He couldn’t stop 
laughing, only he wished to God he could, 
because it made the pain worse. And he 
couldn’t take much more pain. 

The lips of one of the green faces 
moved. "Wress?” said the voice, the word 
pronounced with difficulty. 

"Rest?” Caine said, between spasms of 
laughter that he was quite certain now was 
crying, instead. "Yes, yes,” he said, trying 
to wipe at his tears. "Oh, yes. Rest . . 

Pale green hands extend again, palms 
doum, and make sweeping downward mo- 
tions, destroying evil. They are cupped then 
and raised, slowly, as though lifting purity 
to the top of the golden spires and beyond, 
where a bright sun burns. Feet step sound- 
lessly and figures kneel, circling about a fist- 
sized orb. "Screece," says a flute-like voice. 
"Screece," says another. "Screece," say a 
dozen voices. Hands motion and the silver 
globe is no longer dull and cloudy, but 
filled with pure shining sunlight, so that 
it glitters like a thousand diamonds. Lips 
move silently. A cat whimpers somewhere, 
then sleeps. Silence.

GAMA IS THEE! 

By STANLEY MULLEN 

On Venus, if one rings a doorbell, or bangs on a locked gate 
at night, it is adventure. You never know who— —or what — will 
answer your summons. The door swings slowly open and you 
brace yourself to look. Will it be maid — or monster — or both? 


W HEREVER men gather and talk, 
someone is sure to mention Khal- 
jean’s, on Venus. Men will always 
be fascinated by tales of the strange and 
wonderful and fantastic, and Khaljean’s — 
zoo, petshop, wild animal supply house — 

20 


is the stuff from which legends are made. 
One hears of the place on Mars or Earth, 
on Titan or Rhea, on Callisto or Ganymede, 
even in the subsurface mines of Pluto or 
the curious twilight outposts on Mercury, 
and some of the yarns will probably lessen

the tedium of light-year watches when the 
first manned spacer pushes beyond the fron- 
tiers of the solar system. 

Most of the stories are 21st century ver- 
sions of the tall tale, for both establishment 
and owner stagger imagination and breed 
fabulous accounts. A rumor that Khaljean 
will fabricate to order any nightmarish mon- 
ster from synthetic flesh and organic spare 
parts is obvious exaggeration. The claim 
that Khaljean can mate any curious life- 
form captured by far-roving hunters is also 
false — since he failed twice. Khaljean loves 
animals and collects them chiefly for pleas- 
ure. He will sell some for pets and for 
educational exhibitions, but for each one 
sold he keeps ten. Everyone knows that 
he has frequently risked death rather than 
kill or injure a living creature. 

Of all his zoo’s wonders, none can com- 
pare with Khaljean — for man is the most 
fantastic of animals, and Khaljean is the 
most extraordinary of men. Khaljean is both 
public figure and man of mystery. Nobody 
knows his race or origin, and nowadays no- 
body asks. With the epidemics of muta- 
tion in the Earth-colonies of Venus, and the 
standard gene-tangents accepted among 
Venusian natives, such curiosity is bad form. 
And dangerous. 

So Khaljean’s, and the stories about it, 
have grown steadily through the years. The 
strangest story of all concerning the zoo is 
one that, for good reason, no one tells. It 
happens to be true. One night, in Castarona, 
by the Yellow Sea — 

But the trouble did not start in Khaljean’s. 
There are some who say it did not finish 
there . . . 

A usterity had finally caught up with 
Venus. Pao Chung’s subcellar fung- 
weed hell in the native quarter of old Casta- 
rona was ordered to close every night at 
midnight (Venus time) — or else. Being a 
Venusian business man, a very rugged in- 
dividualist, and a type Q mutant, Pao Chung 
preferred to chance the "or else." 

Among interesting people netted in the 
raid were: 

Pao Chung, himself. Bland and over- 
civilized, he had grown rich from traffic in 
illegal drugs and the outlawed mechanical 
hypnotizers. Despite pointed ears and a 


STORIES 

gnome-like expression of detached malice, 
he appeared to be reasonably human, even in 
his devotion to vice as a means of live- 
liliood. Anything illegal and profitable was 
his vocation; his hobbies ranged from inno- 
cent blackmail to murder for fun. Recent 
extension of his operations from slave trad- 
ing into political corruption had incensed 
even the grafting officials of Castarona. They 
waited only an opportunity to catch him off 
balance. Hence the raid. 

Bat Ferris, spaceman, wanted on an 
open charge warrant sworn out by Solar 
Surveys, Inc., — and wanted preferably alive 
and in condition to answer questions. Ferris 
had learned long ago not to give his right 
name, but an alias is poor disguise if one’s 
brain wave paterns happen to be on file. 
And sometimes if they are not. Being off 
"reservation” at all, and particularly with- 
out permission and lacking his ident-arm- 
band, would mean real trouble. His capture 
in the raid was pure mischance, due to en- 
tering Pao Chung’s only for the virtuous 
purpose of rescuing his partner and friend — 

Bogus Angel, X-type mutant from South 
Venus, painfully well knowm to police rec- 
ords. The only angelic attribute he could 
claim was his twenty-foot wingspread. His 
face bore eerie resemblance to those demonic 
gargoyles carved on medieval cathedrals. 
Fine fur in stripes of ochre, burnt orange 
and smudged brown covered the visible 
parts of his anthropoid anatomy, making 
him resemble a tiger left in the rain long 
enough for the dyes to run. 

Angel liked peace and quiet, and resorted 
to gambling, theft, arson, aggravated assault 
and occasional assassination to obtain it. In 
the icj' morass of his soul, the few cracks 
vented sinister and malicious humor. His 
greatest virtue was warped and violent 
loyalty to Ferris — which was not necessarily 
a virtue from the official point of view. 
Angel’s appetite for and capacity for misuse 
of drugs, alcohol and mechanical hypno- 
tizers was miraculous — but w'hen loaded, 
he was dangerous. 

Of nine others scooped in the raid, only 
one fact need be mentioned. They are still 
in jail, which indicates lack of initiative or 
good sense. Jailbreak on Venus is a sporting 
proposition, and inevitably weeds the sheep 
from the goats. Pao Chung and Bogus Angel

were definitely goats, and Ferris may be 
considered a dark gray sheep. For various 
reasons, it was essential to all three to escape 
— and quickly. 

They stood together in the jailyard. Ferris 
and Angel had relapsed into silence as Pao 
Chung approached. 

"When are you planning escape?” Pao 
Chung asked with a directness not expected 
of him. 

Angel chuckled, but Ferris stared sus- 
piciously. "How are you so sure we intend 
to escape?” he parried. 

Pao Chung shrugged. "A simple question 
easily answered. While your friend was in 
my shop I manipulated the hypnotic ma- 
chines. He talked, chiefly about himself, 
but also about you. Enough to give me a 
clue to your real identity, though probably 
he does not guess it himself. I know that 
you dare not stay. Eventually, they will check 
your brain wave patterns and learn . . . too 
much. Which is the greater risk?” 

"What business is that of yours?” 

"None, directly,” Pao Chung admitted. 
"But I enjoy fishing in troubled waters. 
Other people’s business can often be turned 
to my profit. In this case, since we are being 
frank, I wish to leave with you when you 
go. Take me along, or I talk before you can 
make the attempt.” 

Mayhem shone in Angel’s eyes but Ferris 
put a restraining hand on the furry arm. 

<<T^EAD men don’t talk,” urged Angel 

J-J hopefully, his non-human tongue 
licking feral lips. 

"Wait,” ordered Ferris. “If you kill him 
now, we will have no chance to escape. It 
would draw too much attention to us.” 

"Besides being foolish,” said Pao Chung 
smoothly. "Both of you are strangers in 
Castarona. Where would you go? Who 
would hide you? How long would you last?” 

"Talk fast,” Ferris advised gently. "If you 
know so much, you know we have little to 
lose.” 

"Only your lives, perhaps. More, if my 
deductions are correct. Listen to me. Like 
you, I am in greater peril here. My offense 
is a minor one. By now, I should have been 
fined and let go with a warning. I suspect 
the authorities of more sinister intentions. 
It will be easy to find a pretext if they wish 


to be rid of me. I must escape. Alone, none 
of us would stand a chance. Together, who 
knows . . . ?” 

Ferris consulted his partner with a glance, 
Angel nodded, but imposed a question. 

"And afterwards, what of your deduc- 
tions?” 

"I will forget them,” promised Pao 
Chung. 

"See that you do,” said Ferris. "Or we 
will.” 

Pao Chung ignored the prophecy amiably. 
"I know a possible refuge once we have 
managed the escape. A man in the city owes 
me favors. As refuge, of course, it will be 
temporary. They will have mechanical track- 
ers after us eventually, but not at first. Elec- 
tronic bloodhounds would spoil their sport, 
make killing us too easy. But the nature of 
our sanctuary will give them pause for a 
time. Complex, interesting and dangerous, it 
is the one place in Castarona no one will 
think to look. And there is enough space to 
hide in for quite a while.” 

"Such a place sounds interesting,” Ferris 
agreed. "But I suppose you know every un- 
savory rat’s nest in Castarona.” 

“Not a rat’s nest,” said Pao Chung, smil- 
ing. "Much better. Have you heard of Khal- 
jean’s?” 

"Who hasn’t? That should muddle the 
pursuit for a day or two. But can you count 
on Khaljean?” 

Pao Chung snorted. “Blackmail is my pro- 
fessional secret, so don’t ask details. IQial- 
jean will grant us refuge. Not willingly, per- 
haps, but I have enough on him to guarantee 
his conduct. How about a plan for getting 
out of jail?” 

Ferris laughed harshly. "You’ve paid your 
passage. Now we’ll pay ours. Hiding out 
with the rest of the wild animals seems very 
appropriate. Listen carefully . . .” 

Pao Chung and Angel bent an ear, nod- 
ding approval. 

Jailbreak looks temptingly easy. Hazards 
of escape are mostly mental, so far as bar- 
riers of barred doors and windows, locked 
gates, or walls of stone, metal or plastic are 
concerned. Inner and outer doors are fre- 
quently open. Prisoners move about at will, 
within defined limits. Even there, no phys- 
ical hindrance is put in the escapee’s way. He 
may pause at the door and indulge in whim- 


M PLANET STORIES 


sical repartee with guards or warden. He may 
delay his exit long enough to exchange 
fond farewells with friends and fellow in- 
mates — and he had better. 

Once outside the fun begins. It is open 
season on fugitive prisoners, and the first 
guard lucky enough to fatally blast an es- 
capee receives two weeks with pay and a 
cash bonus for every hour short of the dead- 
line required for killing or recapturing a 
runaway. Any prisoner who makes good his 
escape, and lasts a full three days is written 
off die books. Either way, he is written off, 
since the guards make no pretense of trying 
to recapture him alive, and the hunt is 
geared to surprising efficiency. 

It should be a spirited gamble, but few 
men ever make the attempt, and fewer still 
succeed — so tlie sport may be said to lan- 
guish. History records only five men who 
made the finish line, though hundreds used 
to try for it. Building walls opposite the 
gateway bear leprous scars from blaster dis- 
charges which brought several daring at- 
tempts to pyrotechnical conclusions. 

Angel sauntered up to a guard on duty at 
the main gate. He looked across the busy 
street at the flaking walls and evidences of 
extreme heat. A bored guard glanced casu- 
ally at the brawny Venusian, taking curious 
note of his folded wings. 

"Going out.^” asked the guard with cyn- 
ical humor. "You’ll get those wings singed, 
sonny.” 

Angel smiled, and a dream of violence 
lived briefly in his gem-faceted eyes. "I 
might,” he mused softly. "What handicap 
will you give me?” 

"Close my eyes and count to five,” of- 
fered the guard, grinning viciously. 

"Start counting,” suggested Angel. 

T he guard’s eyes and mouth opened wide, 
his grin changed to a glare, alert and 
suspicious. At that moment, alarms blared 
in the cellblock and jailyard. 

Angel appeared to stumble, thrusting him- 
self heavily against the guard. Already off- 
balance, trying to look in two directions at 
once, the man lurched halfway through the 
gate. Automatic selenium cell alarms caught 
the movement and added their wild clamors 
to the jangling babel from the building. 
Volumes of dense black smoke poured from 


doors and windows of the cellblock’s lower 
floors. From above came shrill screams from 
the trapped inmates on upper floors. 

"Fire!” yelled Angel. Then he was run- 
ning, not through the gate but towards the 
building. 

Guards and prisoners milled in ultimate 
confusions. Jailyard was a melee, but Angel 
forced a passage. At tlie cellblock doorway 
he paused long enough to make sure that 
guards were rushing a long ladder of light- 
metal alloy to the wall. 

Inside, he plunged through churning con- 
fusions of smoke, sound and invisible solids. 
In a city as imflammably built as Castarona, 
fire inevitably creates panic. Equipment must 
be always at hand. Automatic sprinklers 
were already deluging the threatened in- 
terior with water and chemicals. Angel 
waded knee-deep in chemical foam to the 
stairway and ascended against the pressure 
of a descending waterfall. Voices and metal- 
lic alarms mingled in shrill discords. 

Groping blindly and colliding with hys- 
terical prisoners, Angel fought up tlie spi- 
raling cascades of the stairway like a trout 
seeking the spawning grounds. 

At the fourth floor, he got to a window 
and smashed the glass, then set up a bedlam 
of howls and shrieks. From below, the light- 
alloy ladder angled up toward him. Its hooks 
engaged the window ledge. With a yelp of 
maniacal joy, he snatched it from the hands 
of the steadiers on the ground, and gave a 
series of quick jerks to dislodge the mount- 
ing guards and firefighters. With easy 
stren^, he lifted it clear of the ground 
and rung by rung hoisted it upward. Bat 
Ferris and Pao Chung grasped it from the 
roof parapet and held on while he raced 
upstairs again and helped them drag it to 
the roof. 

The nearest building was just about a lad- 
der-length away. 

By prodigies, they raised it to the vertical, 
then let it slant in the direction indicated. It 
toppled and swung in a wild arc. There 
was a bad moment when all three realized 
that it did not quite reach. Acting instanta- 
neously, Angel lifted the pivot end, hooked 
his knees to the parapet and extended the 
ladder by his own length. The far end struck 
hard, bounced high, nearly tearing Angel 
from his precarious hold. 


25 


GAMA IS THEE! 


"Over!” he commanded, while the vibra- 
tions still jarred painfully through his body. 

Without argument, one at a time, Ferris 
and Pao Chung walked gingerly across the 
perilous, swaying bridge. Kneeling, Ferris 
made sure the ladder hooks were secure 
on the other parapet. He cried out. 

Angel relaxed his kneeholds, beating his 
wings furiously and climbing like a bird on 
a breaking treelimb. The ladder swung in 
giant’s pendulum. Angel moved with light- 
ning speed and miraculous precision, main- 
taining balance with threshing pinions while 
his lithe legs and powerful arms carried him 
upward. He was mounting the upper rungs 
when the ladder crashed savagely against the 
building side, writhing, vibrating, tearing its 
hooks free and sending broken masonry 
crashing into the dizzy depths below. Angel 
leaped clear, caught the parapet and dragged 
himself up. 

Guards boiled onto the jailhouse roof and 
laced blaster beams across the chasm be- 
tween buildings. Crouched low, the fugitives 
ran, taking advantage of every cover. Explo- 
sions followed them and they raced through 
pelting storms of molten stone and metal. 

"Over the roofs,” Ferris shouted, '"rhey’ll 
follow soon enough. Probably the near 
streets are already blocked off, and we’ll 
need all the time we can snatch.” 

They halted for breath in the shelter of 
a vast dome. Pao Chung glanced admiringly 
at his enforced allies. "Well-generaled,” he 
commented. "Even to the timing of the 
faked fires. Too bad such talent as ours must 
be wasted on an audience as unappreciative 
as the police. However, you’ve Kept your 
bargain. We’re out, and still alive. With a 
few minutes’ start, and the rooftops of the 
city to play hide and seek in. Now, if we can 
reach Khaljean’s Petshop.” 

"We’ll reach it,” Ferris promised grimly.

A round them was the fantastic skyline. 

From below, in the teeming streets, 
came a rising buzz like the droning activity 
of a hive of angry bees. Above, rose the 
city-wide dome of fused quartz, its crystal- 
line concavity faintly iridescent as it reflected 
the questioning beams of giant searchlights. 
7 — Planet Stories — ^July 


North, between the fugitives and the older 
native quarters of Castarona, were the gigan- 
tic systems of airlocks, and below that, the 
sprawling tangles of dockland. 

Ferris led his companions in a tortuous 
route that covered miles of angled and un- 
even rooftops. Realizing that his ident-cards 
must have come through, he knew that police 
and security officials must be turning the city 
inside out in a wild scramble to locate and 
deal with him. Speed was essential, and 
more than his personal safety depended 
upon the outcome of the wild chase over 
the jagged skylines. 

Knots of wary policemen and determined 
security soldiers invaded the rooftops and 
began searching the hundreds of square 
miles. In case the escaped prisoners had de- 
scended from the high levels, even business 
blocks were being turned out. The whole 
city was undergoing systematic scouring. Of- 
ficialdom was desperate and badly fright- 
ened. Mechanical trackers had already been 
sent for. Never before had they been used 
so early in tlie game. The man, or whatever 
he was. Bat Ferris must be found at once, 
slain if possible. The hunt was on, full cry. 

After two near brushes with patrols, Fer- 
ris finally decided that it would be safer to 
descend to the streets. Dragnets spread over ' 
the world above the city, and only luck had 
kept the trio from being sighted a dozen 
times. They were near the edge of the city 
where the half -bubble of the dome comes 
down into a series of cones which are the 
great airlocks protecting the city-atmosphere 
from the troubled violence and noxious 
fumes of outer Venus. 

Like shadows the fugitives descended, go- 
ing down darkened spirals of stairways, 
stealing elevators, moving furtively among 
dark, twisting alleyways, crawling under vast 
landing stages and skirting heaps of exotic 
Venusian produce ready for shipping to the 
nine inhabited worlds. In the cluttered dock- 
land areas they collided blindly with an 
armed patrol. 

Angel, acting on pure instinct, leaped 
high, then swooped down like a striking 
hawk. Tlie rustle of his opened wings was 
like the flapping of wind-whipped flames. 
His outstretched arms gathered two of the 
four man patrol and crushed life from them 
before they sensed danger. Ferris was al- 


26 PLANET 

most as quick. He leaped and strangled, and 
a man died in swift, deadly silence. Pao 
Chung, unused to managing his own vio- 
lence, was clumsier. A blaster went off. 
Then Angel tocJc over the difficulty. The 
soldier broke and ran, screaming, firing his 
blaster twice more without aiming. 

The uproar would bring help. But the 
soldier was beyond help. Angel soared and 
dived. There was no fight. 

Now armed, the fugitives fled swiftly. 
Pao Chung took over the lead. By devious 
streets and crooked alleys, they went in the 
extremes of haste. 

Further caution was useless. Now that 
the alarm had been given, speed was the 
only hone. Pao Chun^ knew every secret 
rat-run in the old native quarter. He used 
most of them. If the passage of the fugitives 
caused a ripple of excitement among the 
polyglot denizens of that forbidding area, 
they did not know it, nor heed it. All three 
knew the natives well enough to be certain 
that the police could expect no favors from 
that source. All Venusians are natural anar- 
ch born outlaws and rebels against au- 
thority. The trail would die on stubborn 
tongues unless mechanical trackers were 
used. 

Even then, unless the police and security 
squads came in massed force, there would 
be incidents to delay pursuit. Natives, and 
the human debris of nine worlds which 
had found refuge in the quarter, had no 
reason to love autliority. In one sense, the 
area was an armed camp within the walls. 
Uneasy truce at best existed between these 
motley dwellers and the intruding minions 
of the nominal officialdom. While the 
hunted could expect no actual help from 
the guerilla forces of Castarona’s under- 
world, there was the certainty of hindrance 
to the hunters. 

Patrols and searching squads converged 
on the freight-dock stages, drawn by radioed 
reports of a clash. From there a trail of 
sorts led straight into the native quarter. As 
the soldiers and police massed on the 
fringes of the area, sparks of trouble began 
to develop, were quickly fanned to flame, 
and quenched only by continuous violence 
and the arrival of overwhelming forces. 

Pao Chun^ led his companions into a 
dark, zigzagging alley. 


STORIES 

"Not far now,” he gasped hoarsely, strug- 
gling for breath. 

From close behind came a rising uproar. 

T he alley ended abruptly against a high, 
blank, curving wall of reinforced con- 
crete. Pao Chung’s raw, burning throat re- 
fused speech, but he gestured over the wall. 
There was no gate. Angel sprang lightly to 
the top and gave his partners in crime a hand 
up. They dropped into darkness on the far 
side. Light writhed and flickered curiously 
on the great dome overhead. Tumult died 
away behind them as they fled across a wide 
open space, then rose to shocking crescen- 
does. Reflections flared in the dome. 

Uproar dwindled to uneasy silence, as if 
the massed forces of law and order had 
found the native quarter stickier going than 
expected, and had been forced to retire in 
disorder. 

Pao Chung stopped as if checking direc- 
tions, then led off at a sharp tangent. The 
way went through fields. Diflhised light 
from the tall city-buildings filtered in here 
and gave some sense of the ground surface, 
which was fortunate. Numerous small 
fences of wire hummed and sputtered on 
insulator-posts. Electrified guard-fences. Pao 
Chung hurdled them carefully, but they 
were low enough to trip and incinerate an 
incautious trespasser, unaware of their exist- 
ence and unused to their spacing. 

Oppressive silence brooded over the 
place. Atmosphere was thick with pungent 
and exotic odors that lingered with un- 
pleasantly alien tang in the nostrils. 

Ahead loomed a high stockade of chrome- 
steel pilings, pierced by a single monstrous 
gate. 

Pao Chung ran up and hammered on the 
gate. Its res’erberations roused thunderous 
echoes in the night. A curious echo persisted 
and increased in volume. 

On Venus, if one climbs a fence, rings a 
doorbell, or bangs on a locked gate at night, 
it is adventure. You never know who or 
what will answer your summons. The door, 
swings slowly open, and you brace yourself 
to look. Will it be maid or monster — or 
both? 

This was Khaljean’s . . . 

The gate swung open a scant double 
handspan, checked by a short length of 


21 


GAMA IS THEE! 


sturdy chain. A head poked through the 
aperture. An interesting head, even in the 
difficult light. Details were obscure, but 
there was a flash of curd-white skin, fine- 
modeling of feature, a delicate oval face 
framed in a swinging bell of dark hair. 

In this case, tire summons was an- 
swered by, presumably, a maid. Kahljean’s 
daughter, Teucrete, herself something of a 
legend. 

A woman can be described in terms of 
anatomical rhapsody. Or one may dwell end- 
lessly upon sweetness of disposition, upon 
quaint and unique charms of personality. A 
potential lover may fashion poetic conceits 
upon the lilting moonbeam qualities in her 
voice, compare her skin to flower-petals, her 
eyes to gemfires, liken the graceful move- 
ments of limbs and body to the liquid sym- 
phonies of swirling water. Or these matters 
may be left wholly to the imagination and 
the girl described obliquely by reference to 
her effect upon the male population in her 
immediate vicinity. 

The effect was jarring enough. 

"Go away!” she said inhospitably. She 
leaned furtlier through the opening to snarl 
fluent imprecations in Venusian billingsgate 
at the nocturnal callers. 

Pao Chung braved the storm. "Shut up!” 
he said evenly. 

Teucrete’s eyes fixed on him savagely, and 
she took a sharp breath with the obvious 
intention of renewing her tirade. Then she 
thought better of it and restrained her out- 
rage long enough to throw a taunt in his 
face. 

"Is Pao Chung so desperate for money 
that he comes now in the middle of the 
night? You’re two days early for your pay- 
ment. Come back then.” 

"Call your father,” ordered the Venus- 
ian. 

"Khaljean is not here. He’s . . . hunting. 
Come back after noon tomorrow if you must 
see him. ” 

The head withdrew inside. The gate 
crashed shut. Bolts grated. 

"Shall I fly over the stockade and throttle 
her?” asked Angel, rippling his wings. 

Pao Chung hammered the gate again. As 
before, the racketing animal chorus repeated 
the sound, witli variations. Pao Chung kept 
pounding until the gate was opened again. 


This time the head did not appear, but a 
wiry female voice addressed them from the 
inside darkness. 

"Still here? The police must be hunting 
you.” 

"They are.” 

"Good! I will point you out and stay to 
watch the kill.” 

Pao Qiung chuckled evilly. "Do that. The 
records of I^aljean’s background and ille- 
gal activities is in my safe. My will provides 
for publication of all such papers upon my 
death.” 

The voice hesitated. "It might be worth 
humiliation or disgrace to be rid of you 
permanently.” 

"It might,” agreed Pao Chung. "Many 
people have thought so. I wonder if Khal- 
jean will be one of them.” 

With a scrape of bare metal, bolts re- 
treated into so^ets and the chain was re- 
moved. Crack widened enough to permit en- 
trance. 

"Come in, then,” Teucrete said wearily. 
"I will let my father decide when he re- 
turns. For tonight, you can stay. But I won’t 
answer for your safety. The animals are 
roused and nervous. I am not sure I can 
control theni with strangers here.” 

B EAS'TLY cacophonies greeted the en- 
trance of the fugitives. An atmosphere 
of alien and indescribable uneasiness per- 
vaded the vast compound with its rows and 
piled banks of cages. The atmosphere was 
the emotion of night-hauntings, and the 
sound was its voice. 

No sign above the gate proclaimed. Here 
Dwells Nightmae, nor. Through These 
Portals Pass the Most Incredible Life-Forms 
in the Known Universe. There was no circus 
atmosphere. Just a nameless blending of 
sounds and smells and alien vibrations that 
stirred the imagination like evil flames lick- 
ing at forgotten folk memories. On Venus, 
the term unearthly has naturally lost mean- 
ing, but here was a hint of dreadful abysses 
beyond even the exotic fecundity of the 
cloud-veiled planet. Here were half-audible 
chords beyond all the known octaves. Here, 
in the troubled darkness, one sensed symbols 
of instincts, minds and feelings that man 
was never meant to know or understand. 
Here was the final question mark of evolu- 


PLANET STORIES 


28 

tion — ^whence, and to what dreadful pur- 
pose? 

What incredible virtuosity of the Un- 
known Creator had brought these unthink- 
able beings into multiform existence? And 
why? What purpose did they serve in the 
plan of Creation? Or was there any purpose? 
Was there even a plan? 

Bat Ferris remembered such thoughts 
from his lonely, monastic youth on Mars, 
and during the schooling period on Earth. 
One had time for long unhappy thoughts in 
such a segregated childhood and some of 
them still reverberated deep inside him. 

The girl drew back to let them enter, 
flashing the beam of a hand radilume on 
each in turn. Her glance flicked each of them 
in examination sharp enough to draw blood. 
She received them in silence, for Teucrete’s 
mind was not on the duties of a hostess to 
unexpected guests. 

“Wait here,” she ordered crisply. Then 
she went among the tangled avenues be- 
tween cages and spoke soothingly to the 
caged brutes. Her voice crackled, purred, 
coughed, roared, hissed. 

The bird people were the first to heed. 
Their bright, nervous chittering subsided 
into occasional geysers of chirping. Surly 
sand leopards from Mars paced their cages 
and vented sounds like needles caught in 
the grooves of antique disc recordings. Par- 
tially gaseous life forms from Saturn had 
no vocal apparatus, but showed their uneasy 
displeasures by flaring into sullen crimsons 
and bruised purples of luminosity. 

Ferris followed the girl closely on her 
rounds, his eyes staring in wonder at the 
caged monsters revealed when her light 
bathed the barred cubicles. Some cages were 
not cages in the ordinary sense at all. Behind 
barriers of streaming light crouched proto- 
plasmic entities of no set form. Moondogs 
sported aimlessly in pools of ionized gas. 
Wireflies battered themselves against in- 
visible net barriers. Complex mysteries of 
Plutonian life-forms floated in magnetic 
fields. Metallic crystals built themselves into 
coral-like colonies resembling miniature 
castles. 

Less outre creatures inhabited the myriads 
of cell-blocks — ^the ordinary and extraor- 
dinary varieties of apes and cats and dogs, 
the bovines and marsupials, the squeaking 


rats and trumpeting elephants, the endless 
species of sea-creatures, the tree-haunters 
and the desert dwellers, the burrowers and 
the flyers. There were supposedly extinct 
saurians, and examples of tomorrow’s freaks 
and mutants. There were brute clowns and 
tragedians. There were — 

But Khaljean’s has been described often 
enough in magazine articles, sometimes with 
tri-dimensional pictures in color. Any reader 
so inclined may look into the back files of 
Inter-Planetary Magazine and stupefy him- 
self with the famous issue of July, 2091. 

Teucrete sensed that she was followed, 
but with pointed insolence, ignored Ferris 
and continued her rounds. Gradually, her 
eerie tones brought calm to the multiform 
excitements of the compound. She returned 
eventually to Pao Chung and Angel. 

“I will take you back through the lab- 
oratories to the inner maze,” she said 
irritably, "Move quietly and do not stumble 
in the dark. Some of the protection barriers 
are fragile, and a few exist only in the 
minds of the creatures in them. If excited 
too much, they can break through. Many are 
man-killers.” 

"One man-killer runs loose in here,” ob- 
served Angel drily. 

Teucrete disposed of the intended com- 
pliment with a sneer. "Pao Chung has long 
had such ideas. Through pressure on my 
father he has tried to ... to buy or barter 
for me. Such disposal is mine to make, not 
my father’s. I have my price, but it is 
high.” 

It is evidence of Teucrete’s more obvious 
charms that three masculine minds went 
into gear, calculating resources. 

Teucrete laughed viciously. "The first 
item is Pao Chung’s head on a platinum 
platter.” 

"A platinum platter is not unobtainable,” 
said Angel speculatively. 

Pao Chung was not offended. He chuck- 
led unpleasantly. "Such fire as yours would 
bring a high price in the slave marts of 
Yabn,” he said. "My head would bring 
more, locally. Should we not move further 
from the gates? A scanner could pierce sev- 
eral layers of metal as thin as this stockade. 
Perhaps I can bring your price down, or my 
offer up. But another occasion for bargain- 
ing would suit both of us better.” 


GAMA IS THEE! 


"If tliere are other occasions for any of 
us,” Ferris put in bitterly. 

From outside came tire sounds of many 
movements, the rustle and clatter of quest- 
ing men, hoarse shouts and a confusion of 
crowd sounds. Above all, like a thin thread 
of sound, binding the other noises together, 
was a high, ear-piercing, nerve-wracking 
drone. 

Angel flittered to the top of tire stockade 
and peered warily through the razor-edged 
metal pilings. He swooped down to his com- 
panions with whispered verification of their 
suspicions. 

"The mechanical trackers,” he said. 

"Perhaps there is still a deal open," mut- 
tered Pao Chung. He bowed with sardonic 
malice toward Teucrete. "We have one pos- 
session of greater value than my head or 
your body. My young friend here — ” 

Teucrete snorted contemptuously. "Him!” 
But her glance lingered on Ferris mo- 
mentarily. "What do you mean?” 

"Ferris is a gamma-man,” said Pao 
Chung. Even Angel gasped with shock. 
Teucrete’s eyes widened in incredulity, hor- 
ror and fear. 

Ill 

EAR is a subtle poison. 

It began long ago, in a small New 
Mexico town, long before there were 
gamma-men or even interplanetary travel. 
The fear radiated from mushrooming clouds 
with impossible radiance at the core, and the 
fear did more harm to the minds of men 
than the deadly spectra of invisible death 
did to their bodies. 

It began with scientists in cages in the 
name of national securities; it developed into 
continual surveillance for all men engaged 
in atomics. These workers, and their fam- 
ilies, led cloistered, monastic lives. They in- 
termarried, since there was little contact with 
outsiders, and they shared generations of 
haunted, spy-ridden lives. They lived in the 
midst of fear and mistrust, while the earth 
went through its chronic spirals of war and 
the preparations. Throughout history, schol- 
ars and philosophers have warned that 
knowledge must be free and universal, like 
sunlight. But there have always been wars 
and secrets and guarded weapons, and fear 


is older than man. 

Scientists were men of dangerous knowl- 
edge, of destructive potentials. As such, they 
were hostages of fear and illusions of safety. 
They were segregated, guarded, well-fed, 
and at first provided with all the deadly toys 
necessary to their amusements. It was all 
painfully logical and futile, but all the best 
brains of mankind were locked up to putrefy 
for lack of fresh air and the stimuli of 
mutual thoughts. Their knowledges and pre- 
rogatives became hereditary. 

Natural law works against segregation. 
Artificial isolation of any group leads to 
misunderstandings, prejudices, resentments, 
mutual fears, and eventually to violence. 
Fear-hysteria is a serpent devouring its own 
tail. In time, the once-honored and glorified 
gamma-men became feared and hated. In the 
minds of the ignorant and superstitious pop- 
ulace, they were associated with medieval 
wizards and workers of dreadful miracles. 
The threat of gamma groups became a po- 
litical pawn, and was used as a club to beat 
down restless, unhappy populations. 

With their knowledge, and the popular 
delusion of their almost supernatural powers, 
it was easy enough for ambitious men to 
misuse the Scientists. In some cases, the 
gamma-men themselves usurped authority, 
but this noble experiment slipped through 
their fingers, and they lost control from 
sheer unworldliness. In trutli, from the 
working of natural law, the juice had run 
out of diem and they no longer understood 
the basics of normal human relations. In a 
final paroxysm of public panic, they were 
disarmed, their toys taken away, and every 
last gamma-man imprisoned in carefully 
guarded and isolated colonies. Like the an- 
cient Indians, they were placed in reserva- 
tions and kept there by force. 

After this culminating outrage, the gam- 
ma-men lost heart for practical activity. 
Locked into their libraries, they turned to 
abstractions and dabbled in dead-end philos- 
ophies, Most of them were querulous old- 
sters, hidebound by tradition, their sciences 
now become a ritual religion, their books 
exalted <ts "The Word,” and their fading 
knowledge still held secret for reasons long 
forgotten. 

Not quite all gamma-men accepted this 
half-life allotted to them. There were sports,

avatars, occasional throwbacks who rebelled 
and went "off reservation.” 

None of these actually ran amuck, but 
so great was the fear-conditioning on one 
side, and so difficult the adaptation to or- 
dinary living on the other that there were 
painful accidents and incidents. Nothing 
genuinely monstrous occurred, but enough 
friction developed to keep alive and add to 
the public dreil of gamma-men. The term 
became a byword for nursery terror. And in 
their turn, the infant generations of gamma- 
men learned to pity and despise the ignorant 
and corrupt multitudes of normal humanity. 
They lost contact with their human heritage. 

In recent years, few gamma-men had 
broken out to mingle with the expanding 
races now peopling and colonizing the fron- 
tiers of the solar system. Those few were 
hunted down like outlaws, and killed with 
brutal ingenuity. 

But a new generation had come among 
gamma-men, with an urge so passionate and 
devout they themselves did not understand 
it. Either some latent folk-memory, or some 
emotional mutation, urged them to go forth 
and civilize mankind. In the old books, they 
tracked down knowledge and made gran- 
diose plans for engineering the renaissance. 
Realizing their common origin, and longing 
for more nearly normal lives, they grouped 
together and made a pact to see some 
changes made. 

Studying history and the other technolo- 
gies of man, they soon discovered that social, 
economic and psychological sciences had 
lagged far behind the other developments. 
These were the blind spots of mankind, and 
these led to all the other serious and tragic 
misdirections of effort. Always, the sons of 
Adam had struggled to achieve workable 
systems, and always these systems had broken 
down or failed at critical moments. 

If some means could be found — 

Eventually, the means was tracked down 
from a clue in one of the oldest books. It 
was not found, but its existence deduced and 
proved to the satisfaction of the searchers. 
Somewhere, hidden in a forgotten corner 
of the solar system, was the missing tool. 

This fact settled, it became necessary to 
locate and use the missing tool. 

It was a pitifully small generation. Only 
seven bright-eyed and high-hearted young 


men. But that night they broke out of their 
prescribed boundaries. They went off reser- 
vation, and separated in seven directions. 
Each had a theory, and a hope to be ex- 
plored. 

Without their ident-armbands of plati- 
num with the old Greek letter deeply 
incised, they resembled any other seven 
youths picked at random from the teeming 
multitudes. They could mingle unques- 
tioned, and their studies had prepared them 
for various tasks to whicli their forged pa- 
pers entitled them. But adaptation was not 
easy. 

A single incautious moment could be- 
tray them. Even a routine brain-wave check 
would be sufficient to identify the fugitives, 
for in subtle ways, the gamma-men were 
different. 

Seven young men with a noble purpose, 
and fanatical hopes in their hearts. 

And now there were two. Five of them 
had made fatal slips, and had been hunted 
down to hideous deaths. 

Ferris was one of the 'two survivors. 

F our people stood paralyzed while the 
hammering resounded at the gate. This 
was no human fist demanding attention, but 
an odd, robot-like clanking, as if a mechan- 
ical beast nosed in determined rooting 
against the metal leaves of the gate. 

It was just such a beast. A burring whine 
rose into notes of shrill frustration. Metallic 
and electronic frustration, for the tracker 
was a bloodhound of vacuum tubes and re- 
lays and switches and batteries and trans- 
formers. Unerring and inexorable, its robot 
senses sorted a single frequency from all 
other brain wave patterns, and it clung to 
the trail with chilling efficiency. Something 
about its unhuman lusting numbed most 
quarry before the pursuers in charge of the 
monster could check its demonic eagerness 
for prey. 

Now, like a metallic carnivore scenting 
blood, the robot tracker nuzzled the gate 
and rebounded to nuzzle gain. 

All four of the humans inside the com- 
pound imagined the scene outside. Pencil 
beams of hand radilumes glinted here and 
there, the questing soldiers and police 
squads, the glittering serpentine body of the 
tracker, with its scurrying treads churning

GAMA IS THEE! 


clouds of dust as it whined and rooted at 
the gate. 

Bat Ferris shot a glance of uneasy calcu- 
lation at his three companions. The girl was 
an unknown quantity. Angel, momentarily 
shocked, was predictable enough within 
limits. Pao Chung was openly an opportun- 
ist, willing to turn any situation to personal 
profit. Unarmed, Ferris could not even deal 
with them, let alone with the police outside. 
He frowned angrily. 

Teucrete’s stare held on him for a mo- 
ment, as if puzzled. Her eyes moved on, 
focusing on Angel, then Pao Chung. Pres- 
ently, they came back to Ferris, amused and 
faintly mocking. 

"What is a gamma-man doing here?” she 
asked. 

"An interesting question,” said Pao 
Chung ironically. "But not of prime impor- 
tance at the moment.” 

Ferris watched a smile writhe on the 
girl’s lips and felt a quick relief. She might 
help, if only to thwart Pao Chung’s idea of 
throwing him to the human wolves out- 
side. 

A harsh voice clamored for admittance. 

The animals were growing restive again. 
An earthy bellow boomed out against a 
counterpoint of birdlike trills. The sand 
leopards coughed guttural warnings. Some- 
where a pygmy elephant trumpeted, and the 
giant insects burst into deafening clatters. 

Teucrete motioned for silence, then drew 
the bolts and held the gate ajar on its short 
chain. 

"Who’s there?” she demanded roughly. 

"Police,” several voices explained. "Open 
the gate, or we’ll break it down.” 

"Have you a warrant?” 

"It’s a security matter,” someone ex- 
plained hopefully. 

"Tell that to the animals,” she stormed. 
"It’s as much as your life’s worth to come 
in here tonight. They’re upset already, and 
I can’t control them if you keep up this 
noise. Go away.” 

An authoritative voice blustered. "This is 
an important matter. Let me talk to your 
father.” 

Teucrete shrugged. "He will be back by 
noon tomorrow. Come then, and bring a 
warrant to search. Or — ” 

She followed die speech with some in- 


sulting suggestions, not in the best of tascc. 
The authoritative voice turned into a gargle 
addressing a slammed gate. Profanity did not 
disturb the tracker, which continued to root 
noisily at the metal. 

Teucrete shoved bolts into sockets and 
stood back. She sighed, and beckoned the 
three men to follow her. 

They moved amid a nightmarish cacoph- 
ony of sounds. In memory roused by the 
various elements of the uproar. Bat Ferris 
revisited the far planets. Fortunately the 
light was too dim to see all the sources of 
sound, but Ferris mentally identified many 
of the caged dwellers by ear or by nose. 

Wrigglers from the mercury mines of 
Callisto. Venusian swamp slugs, and grull- 
cats from the Tihar Forest. Morbau-spawn 
from the honeycombed caverns of Triton. 
Wireflies and needle-flies, known by their 
eerie humming and buzzing. Seven-limbed 
bat-noses from the twilight zone of Mercury. 
Iceworms from Neptune and Pluto, and the 
deadly windharps from Mars. Amiably im- 
becilic moondogs from the satellites of 
Saturn pressed blank flat faces against the 
walls of their insulated glass tanks. Mon- 
sters out of nightmare. A madman’s miscel- 
lany. 

There was more, an incredible infinity of 
animal horizons. But imagination reels back, 
and description falters. Wliat words can 
catalog the fringes of morphology! 

F erris focussed his interest on the girl. 

Teucrete. A strange name, and as strange 
a being as these she lived among. He won- 
dered idly about her racial background. Her 
father’s origin was a mystery, and who 
could say what mate he had found on fecund 
Venus? Was his daughter one of those half- 
human mutants, or was she just what she 
seemed, a wilful and badly raised human 
girl? Ferris could only guess, and await 
further evidence of her intentions toward 
him. 

But he liked the way she walked. Tall, 
straight, slender 4s a spear, and as poised. 
Pride was in her, and a hint of warped 
character in her frigid disdain of weakness 
or fear. Physically — but Ferris was no 
authority on feminine beauty. On the reser- 
vation women had been scarce, most of them 
neurotic virgins, or old. He had known 


32 PLANET 

women since, but mostly the hard, cynical 
opportunists of the planetary frontier boom- 
towns. None to share a life with. 

Vast perspectives of cages and tanks and 
pressure vats went off in all directions. He 
would not have imagined so much area cov- 
ered by the establishment. It seemed limit- 
less, and all its dimensions were oddly con- 
fusing. Intentionally so, since it was laid out 
in kbyrinthine fashion. Unguided, a 
stranger could lose himself in a matter of 
minutes. It defied belief that a 200 of such 
colossal proportions could exist within the 
precincts of a city, even such a sprawling 
megalopolis as Castarona. But at last they 
were through tlie cage areas, which lined the 
periphery of the compound, and Teucrete 
led the men into a building of dazzling 
white stone. 

"My father’s kboratory,” she explained. 
"Here we synthesize foods for the animals, 
and try with all our ingenuity to provide an 
approximate environment for them.” 

Her voice brought Ferris back to the pres- 
ent. "It won’t work,” he said. "Security 
squads will never wait for a warrant. Even 
if they do, what good is half an hour? 
They’ll break down your gate and swarm 
through here like hunting bees.” 

Teucrete laughed scornfully. "Afraid, 
gamma-man?” 

"If I were I wouldn’t be here. But only 
a fool refuses to recognize danger.” 

"Relax,” she advised. "They will break 
in, true. But there may be a little difficulty 
finding their way among the cages. It is a 
maze, as you saw. And the animals will give 
them some trouble. I am not forgetting the 
tracker, but the moondogs and wireflies can 
confuse anything that operates on electron- 
ics. All we need is a slight delaying action. 
We can count on that.” 

"There is another exit?” asked Pao Chung 
eagerly. 

Her laugh crystallized in tinkling frag- 
ments, like showering shards of glass. "An- 
other exit, yes. The way my father goes 
when he hunts. If you have the nerve to 
take it! But compose yourself, Pao Chung. 
You will need supplies of food, water, air, 
special clothing. And . . . there is a price.” 

Hesitantly, unhappily, Pao Chung in- 
quired the price. 

"The way is dangerous,” she said rapidly. 


STORIES 

"You might not come back. And I must 
see that my father is protected. Give me an 
order on your bank or lawyer for all the 
evidence you have against him; for what- 
ever crimes or stupidities he may have com- 
mitted.” 

"How do you know such an order will 
be honored?” Pao Chung muttered specu- 
latively. "Once I am free — ” 

The girl tossed her head till the bell of 
ebony hair swung dangerously. "It had bet- 
ter be honored,” she warned crisply. "For 
there is only one way back ... if you ever 
come back. And I can control it. I don’t 
think you will like your surroundings well 
enough to remain there indefinitely.” 

Pao Chung bowed to the inevitable. Angel 
chuckled moodily, and Bat Ferris faced Teu- 
crete with admiration on his pleasantly ugly 
features. 

"Well done,” he praised. "Is there a price 
for me?” 

"No price to a man who likes animals. 
I sensed that in you as we passed the cages.” 

Impulsively, the girl leaned toward Ferris 
and forced her lips violently on his. "That 
is for luck, gamma-man. On the house, but 
the next one might cost you dearly. Watch 
yourself.” 

Ferris clung to the sanctuary of masculine 
silence. Pao Chung glowered sullenly, and 
Angel’s amusement sent iridiscent ripples 
glinting from his wings. 

"How about me?” he demanded. 

"No kiss, no price,” she told him, "but 
a word of advice, mutant. Keep those wings 
out of revolving doors.” 

Angel grinned happily, his gargoyle face 
wrinkling into impossible contortions. "They 
are a nuisance.” 

Newly garbed and equipped, the men fol- 
lowed 'Teucrete from the building. Stopping 
to stuff Pao Chung’s order into a some 
feminine idea of a safety-vault, not too safe 
in the company of lecherous males, Teucrete 
conducted her charges through a lovely 
formal garden that functioned by concealed 
hydroponics, and on into another built up 
area. 

But this was no cubicle of stone or steel 
or plastic. It was a roofless structure of glass. 
Vertical panels of glass ran off beyond sight. 
Panels of all colors, all degrees of trans- 
parency. Some were as lucid as crystal, some 


GAMA IS THEE! 


barely translucent, and more bent or mir- 
rored to distort, reflect or refract light. All 
were tinted, some weakly, others violently 
stained. The place was stridently illuminated 
by concealed radi-floods. It was a solid mass 
of rainbow effects, a forest of crystal mirrors 
and shafts and flickering, glowing prisms. 

One entered by a kind of airlock, or more 
accurately, a lightlock. There was no change 
in atmospheric pressure, but the density 
and beating force of sheer luminosity in- 
creased by squares and cubes as the travel- 
lers strode through linked cubes of glass. 

They entered the light maze. Dazzling 
splendors beat upon them. Vision was 
overwhelmed by visible vibrations. They 
drowned in light.

«'p\ON’T touch anything,” warned Teu- 

J-'crete. "Exact alignment is important.” 

She stopped before a keyboard like the 
console of a gigantic organ. Behind it rose 
massed ranks of vacuum tubes, all glowing, 
humming, flickering. The girl’s fingers skip- 
ped nimbly on the keys, and notes of sound 
rose in tinkling, chiming sprays from the 
shafts. Colors stormed and raged in the crys- 
talline forest, running up and down the 
visible octaves of light. One sensed other 
scales beyond, in both upper and lower 
wavelengths. Glass panels and crystal shafts 
vibrated to sound and light, like tuning 
forks. They stirred, quivered, vanished, then 
reappeared. A tall man appeared among the 
shafts and strode toward the travellers. 

"Khaljean!” said Pao Chung nervously. 

It was sufficient introduction. There was 
uncanny resemblance between father and 
daughter, like two matched paintings in dif- 
ferent keys. The animal man listened 
quietly, while Teucrete explained the situa- 
tion. He looked at Pao Chung and laughed. 
He shrugged. 

"A bargain is a bargain,” said Khaljean. 
"Perhaps I should go back to Venus and 
fabricate some gnawed bones to convince the 
police searching parties that the animals de- 
voured you. All of you had better remain 
here and wait till I send for you.” 

“You are good at faked evidence,” Pao 
Chung jibed bitterly. 

"In a good cause, yes,” agreed Khaljean 


63 

good-naturedly. "Even in a bad cause, this 
time. Stay here. You will be safer.” 

"Wait!” ordered Ferris. 

Klialjean measured him mockingly. 
"Who are you to say?" 

"I am a gamma-man,” Ferris told him. 

"That doesn’t frighten me, youngster. So 
am I. Or was. Do you know the name 
Djevos Barian?” 

Ferris blinked. "But Barian was hunted 
down and killed, his remains positively iden- 
tified. 

Khaljean smiled. "As Pao Chung said, I 
am good at faked evidence. I always had a 
skill with synthetics. A man thing I created 
lived long enough to be slaughtered in my 
place, and I had constructed him well, even 
to duplicating my fingerprints and brain pat- 
terns. Officially I am dead. But ten years 
ago Pao Chung found out about me. He has 
bled me systematically ever since. Until 
now.” 

"Shall I kill him for you?” asked Angel, 
with malicious joy in the thought. "Now 
that you have access to his evidence, his life 
can be only a menace to you.” 

Khaljean frowned. "I don’t believe in 
killing. But sometimes Pao Chung has 
tempted me. No, let him live.” 

"So you are Barian?” said Ferris admir- 
ingly. 

"Was Barian. I have become Khaljean. 
The real one was a small-time operator, 
dealing chiefly in dead animals. I was with 
him when he died. We were much alike in 
appearance. With plastic surgery', I became 
Khaljean. And I have made the name fa- 
mous. You must be one of the seven recent 
escapees from the reservation. We will have 
much to talk about later.” 

"Not later,” insisted Ferris. "Now. 
Where does this maze lead?” 

Khaljean humored him. "Nowhere or 
anywhere. It’s a dimensional short cut that 
can take you to any place in the solar uni- 
verse, or even a few odd places in adjacent 
or parallel spacetime continuums. Is there 
somewhere you want to go?” 

Ferris nodded soberly. “A place I must 
go. Now, if possible.” 

"Why?” Khaljean studied the younger 
man grimly. 

“I’m not sure you could understand, since 
you left the gamma reservation so long ago. 


PLANET STORIES

I’ll try to explain. Somewhere, there is a 
tool. Not tliat exactly, nor a machine either, 
but we call it that for lack of a term. In 
the old books of our library, there was men- 
tion of it. A description, with a hint of prop- 
erties. It is something alien, a control placed 
on the destinies of group-man.” 

His voice droned on, speaking as if the 
subject were a lesson he had learned by 
rote. "Many times, man’s social and political 
organization has painfully climbed the lad- 
der toward a workable, civilized system, but 
always it has slipped and fallen back. The 
individual mind functions well, for the most 
part, but not so the group-mind. Any crowd 
IS less honest, less ^cient, and far less in- 
telligent than its individual units. The larger 
the crowd, the greater the tangent, the pos- 
sibilities for evil and injustice. In attempts 
to solve the problems of group relationships, 
man is worse than pitiful. 

"Long study has convinced the gamma- 
people that this is not a mere accident. Out- 
side influence warps men’s thinking in 
groups, warps social and political organiza- 
tion. It seems as if group-man struggled 
hopefully to put together a complex jigsaw 
puzzle, in which many parts will fit badly 
into an infinity of possible relationships. The 
true fit is difficult to find, but even the law 
of averages should help in so many attempts. 
Time and time again, just as the puzzle is 
nearly completed, someone joggles the puz- 
zler’s elbow, and the pattern is destroyed. 

"There is such a joggler, such an outside 
influence. Its existence was proved, its in- 
fluence even measured. There are clues scat- 
tered through the old books. We know what 
it is, what it looks like, how it operates, but 
we have been powerless to counteract its 
influence. The warping hypnotic broadcasts 
keep throwing mankind back to chaos, when 
utopia is in sight. It is too strong to combat, 
and the source must be destroyed. By our 
solemn pact, my six friends and I bound 
ourselves to locate and smash this alien 
mechanism.” 

T^HALJEAN licked his lips reflectively. 
-I^ "You interest me,” he admitted. "I 
was once young enough to be idealistic my- 
self. What is this alien monster you de- 
scribe?” 

"Not a monster in the ordinary sense. 


Not a tool, nor quite even a machine. Living 
jewels, perhaps. At least radioactive false 
gems. 

"Gas, probably radon, solidified under 
the incredible pressures in the heart of Jupi- 
ter. Solar Sur\'eys knows about them, for 
they were seen once, and even handled by 
men. There is an article about them in the 
Encyclopaedia of the Solar Planets. In 2036, 
they were discovered, mined by cybernetic 
machinery. Then on their way to Mars, the 
ship carrying the jewels was sabotaged and 
wrecked. Wreckage and frozen bodies were 
discovered on the rogue asteroid Hidalgo, 
but the jewels were missing.” 

Pao Chung had shown growing interest 
in the conversation. He broke in to ask, 
"Stolen?” 

"Stolen, perhaps. Possibly they disinte- 
grated at the time of the wreck, or they may 
have transmuted into something unrecog- 
nized by the searchers. They may have be- 
come tenuous enough to sink through the 
surface of Hidalgo and recrystallized inside. 
But the evil influence continues. We believe 
that they are still there, still in existence, 
working their hidden evil, warping the 
brains of men, producing social and political 
chaos. Five of my friends have lost their 
lives searching for this menace. Possibly the 
sixth is dead, too, since he vanished into the 
unknown and has not been heard from. 

"I tried, myself. Angel and I landed on 
Hidalgo and searched carefully. But Hidalgo 
is 'off limits’ for spacemen. Solar Surveys 
sent the Space Patrol after us, and we fled 
before finishing our search. We were chased 
to Mars, traced and hunted to Venus. We 
crashed there, and while I tried to get money 
for new equipment, Angel got involved 
with Pao Chung. You know the rest. Now 
you see why I must go to Hidalgo.” 

Khaljean shook his head in sorrow. "I 
understand. But you could never find your 
way through the maze." 

Ferris accused him with fanatical eyes. 
"You could help me to find my way.” 

"Not I. I am too old, and I am not sure 
that I approve of your meddling. Not that I 
would try to stop you, but don’t count on 
help from me. How do you know that this 
alien machine is what you say? Its purpose 
may be good, not evil. Some higher intelli- 
gence may have placed it in our system as a

governor to influence mankind^ to shield 
man from his own follies. It may be a warn- 
ing road sign to keep us from crashing into 
a dead end. Our utopias sound very dull to 
me, they may easily be a dead end for man- 
kind. I like the interesting and amusing var- 
iations of chaos, so let me cling to them. 
Follow your destiny, if you will. I won’t 
stop you.” 

Ferris looked pitifully young, but he stood 
his ground with absurd pride and courage. 

"Right or wrong, I must try,” he said 
evenly. "And I won’t grant the right of alien 
interference. Man, too, has a right to w'ork 
out his destiny, good or bad.” 

Angel spoke up eagerly for his partner. 
"I won’t say I know what you’re talking 
about, and maybe I'm too stupid and ig- 
norant to understand. But as a victim of 
'chaos’ I don’t appreciate it.” 

Pao Chung sneered. "One vote for law 
and order from the fallen Angel, if it can 
be believed. Like Khaljean, my preference is 
for chaos, as it furnishes more opportunities 
for a man of my interests. However, my 
soul revolts at this talk of destroying gems 
of presumably unique properties. They must 
have value. Perhaps you can dismantle this 
machine, without harming its parts. As a 
business man, with time on my hands, I 
w'ould like to go with you and see if some- 
thing can be arranged.” 

"I don’t trust you,” Ferris said frankly. 
"And I don’t believe that the jewels can be 
salvaged. Come along if you want. I can’t 
stop you. But don’t tr)' any tricks.” 

Pao Chung accepted the warning with 
bland indifference. 

"Father!” called Teucrete. "Leave me 
your protective suiting.” 

Khaljean smiled with sad irony. "Are you 
making i choice?” 

"Yes. I’m going with them. I know the 
way. I can control the ma2e and guide them 
safely back. I don’t know if I believe in this 
fabulous machine, or jewels,or whatever. But 
I think I might learn to believe in ... in 
him. It’s something I'll have to find out.” 

Smiling, Khaljean stripped off his protec- 
tive armor and yielded it to the girl. As an 
afterthought, he handed her his blaster. 

"The choice is yours to make. But in such 
company, the blaster may come in handy.” 

Khaljean shook hands with Ferris and 


Angel, though he avoided looking at Pao 
Chung. 

To Ferris, he said, "Come back if you 
can. And look after my girl. In the mean- 
time, I’ll throw some gnawed bones to the 
police wolves, and we’ll manufacture a new 
identity for you.” 

Without a farewell, Khaljean strode into 
the crystalline forest. His lonely figure 
paused to wave. 

"Good hunting, father,” Teucrete called 
after him. 

She tripped keys at the console. Light 
quivered in painful vibrations. His figure 
became transparent, then dissolved. . . . 

Absent-mindedly, Teucrete climbed into 
the suit of protective armor. Ferris helped 
her zip up the clumsy garments, then 
clasped her arm impulsively. 

"I haven’t the skill to say it properly — 
but thanks.” 

"I’ll expect your skill to improve with 
experience,” she said irritably, fixing the 
blaster gun securely in its spring clip. 

Returning to the console, Teucrete worked 
out an elaborate composition on the keys. 
Tubes flared and flickered, flamed and faded. 
There was the humming and the bell-toned 
clamor like glass raindrops spattering on a 
ceramic floor. 

“We have arrived,” she whispered. It was 
then Pao Chung acted. 

Q uick as a striking snake, he moved 
close beside the girt and snatched the 
blaster from its clip. 

Backing away, he waved the weapon in 
wide sweeps to menace both Ferris and 
Angel at once. 

Teucrete turned and cried out. Angel 
froze like a statue. Ferris started a rush, then 
thought better of it. 

"New deal, I think,” said Pao Chung 
brutally. "From here on I’ll give the orders.” 

Angel chuckled ferociously. "You can’t 
get both of us, Pao Chung. If w'e rush at 
once, you can kill one, but the other will 
get to you.” 

"Don’t try it,” warned Pao Chung, sweat- 
ing but deadly. 

“You keep talking of deals,” continued 
Angel evenly. "Better make one with me. 
For the girl, and a third of the loot. I’ll talk 
business with you.” 


37 


GAMA tS THEE! 


"I want her myself,” croaked Pao Chung. 

"Neither of you will get me alive,” said 
Teucrete. 

Ferris moved a little, and the gun held 
steadily on him. He hesitated, glancing cu- 
riously at Angel. Light glinted from quiver- 
ing wings. The gargoyle face grinned 
hideously. Heavy eyelids blinked in remem- 
bered signal. 

"Now,” snapped Ferris. 

Ferris and Angel leaped, like two moving 
parts of the same machine. Angel was 
quicker. His powerful wings wafted him in 
a long, swift bound. 

The blaster swerved, flamed, burst in 
deafening explosion. A reek of charred, dis- 
integrating flesh and singed feathers filled 
the air. 

Angel shrieked in torment as his legs 
vanished in crumbling ashes. Wings flailing, 
his body a maimed and blasted horror, he 
crashed down upon Pao Chung. The gun 
jerked from nerveless fingers and clattered 
on the floor. Its beam cut a tinkling swathe 
among the crystal shafts. Real droplets of 
half-molten crystal struck myriad bell-tones 
in falling. 

Writhing and threshing in agony, Angel 
clung to his desperate purpose. Powerful 
clawlike hands circled Pao Chung’s head and 
wrenched it off. The head rolled free like 
a ball as two snarled bodies sagged to- 
gether in bloody horror. 

Stricken, Ferris bent over his friend, try- 
ing hopelessly to help. The gargoyle lips 
parted. Dry husks of sound whistled from 
them. 

"Go cn. Smash the machine! But first, do 


this job right — for me.” 

Trembling, Ferris recovered the blaster 
gun, cut down its intensity, then thrust the 
blunt muzzle deep into the striped fur, 
where rich crimson now mingled with the 
other gaudy dyes. Blinking his eyes shut, 
he pressed the stud. Angel writhed and 
was gone. 

Ferris did not look back. Hand in hand 
with Teucrete he walked slowly toward the 
forest of crystal shafts. There was much 
damage, and his heart quailed from the task 
ahead. 

"Can you still find the way?” he asked 
numbly. 

"I’m not sure,” the girl faltered. "I’m not 
sure we can ever get back. Exact alignment 
is so terribly important.” 

"We can try,” said Ferris grimly. 

Hand in hand, young men and women, 
with the dream still fresh within them, will 
always seek the ultimate answer to the ul- 
timate questions. It may be, of course, that 
there is no ultimate answer, and that even 
the quest is a delusion. But Teucrete and 
Ferris, with the flame of a new love burning 
fiercely between them, believed that it was 
important to find and destroy some alien 
thing that warped men’s minds. Others may 
think only of ouilding a life together, as a 
pledge to the future, but not Teucrete and 
Ferris. Time for that later, they hoped. 

For the moment, they might, just possibly, 
make mankind’s tomorrows a little brighter, 
or more hopeful. 

Hand in hand they walked together to 
the crystal maze, and entered. Perhaps they 
found something. . . .

TASK OF KAYIN 

By WILLIAM MORRISON 


From out beyond the second sun he came; a fugitive from 
a dead and sterile world . . . seeking solace, friends, a 
home, on Earth — a planet of even greater terrors. 


T he sensation of which he was most 
conscious was that of loneliness. He 
was no longer very much afraid, and 
sometimes he even thought that his enemies 
back home were no longer hunting for him. 
But in the midst of these strange creatures 
he learned that there was one thing worse 
than open hostility, and that was indiffer- 
ence. They had no more interest in him than 
they had in each other, and even though their 
indifference increased his own chances for 
safety, it was a chilling thing none the less. 

He knew that though they were like him 
superficially, they were intensely different 
within. He stood at a street corner trying to 
fathom the difference, while the crowds 
surged about him, buffeting him from side 
to side. They seemed to have no idea of per- 
sonal dignity. He still understood their lan- 
guage only imperfectly, and spoke it with 
difficulty, but he had learned, in a primitive 
way, to read their faces, and during this 
time of day, at least, their faces tola of a 
strain and fear all their own, of an uncer- 
tainty' even greater than his. They were going 
home from work, and they were afraid of 
countless trifles — that something unpleasant 
might happen, that they might not get seats 
on their conveyances, that bad news might 
greet them when they arrived. 

He stared with fascination at a heap of 
newspapers spread out on the corner stand. 
He could guess the purpose of these layers 
of white sheets covered with black or red 
symbols, but he could not yet interpret them, 
and he had no idea whether any one had 
seen or reported his ship. It was almost cer- 
tain that some one had observ'ed a shooting 
star, but the chances were very much against 
any observation having been made of the 
star’s slow, dark drift to earth. At any rate, 
he had concealed his ship among the growth 
38 


of tall native plants, and some day he would 
find time to repair the relatively minor dam- 
age he had sustained, and continue his jour- 
ney. 

Meanwhile, he had to make up his mind 
what to do here. His original store of food 
had been exhausted a week before as these 
creatures counted time, and despite the fact 
that his metabolic requirements were low, he 
had long needed to eat again. The food that 
was exhibited in many stores was of a kind 
strange to him, but from the very structure 
and behavior of individuals who ate it, he 
knew that it was of the right chemical com- 
position. Examining it cautiously with a 
small analyzer held close to his eye, he noted 
that at least it contained none of the more 
dangerous poisons. It would do, if he could 
obtain it. 

But he must obtain it in a manner that 
these creatures considered legal, not as he 
had obtained his clothes. He recalled how 
absurdly different his own clothes had been, 
constructed to fit a creature whose morphol- 
ogy was so much unlike theirs. He had taken 
over a suit from a man he had met driving 
on a dark country road, not too close to the 
ship. He had stopped the car and put the 
man to sleep without difficult}', but there 
must have been a great outcry after his vic- 
tim had awakened to find himself cold and 
naked in the driver's seat. 

He hadn’t minded, for he had already left 
the place where the incident had occurred. 
But he wanted no hue and cry raised here. 
Although under other conditions he would 
have minded their hostility no more than 
their indifference, he knew that hostility now 
might very seriously limit his freedom to 
act. 

He listed the things he had to do. He had 
to find food and shelter, learn their language

and customs, and as quickly as possible, their 
alphabet. He had to acquire their manner of 
thought and feeling so well that he could 
blend with them not only superficially, but 
psychologically as well. He had to — 

A ROUGH shoulder caught him on the 
chest and spun him half around. A 
rough voice, more a snarl than anything else, 
said, "Whatsa matter, ya blind?” 

The way the words were run together 
confused him, but he had listened keenly, 
and he knew the phrase that was required in 
such situations. He said politely, but almost 
unintelligently, "Excuse. I sorry.” 

"Foreigner, huh? Why don’t ya go back 
where ya came from?” 

This was the first person who had spoken 
to him in his new world. The encounter left 
him angry and contemptuous, but it was not 
to be long before he learned that the indi- 
vidual he had been privileged to meet was 
not wholly typical. 

He moved along, alert to observe and to 
learn, but entirely without aim so far as an 
ultimate destination was concerned. He 
noted that the nature of the streets he trav- 
ersed changed subtly with every intersection. 
The primitive, but well constructed build- 
ings that had lined them soon gave way to 
even more primitive, dilapidated, and filthy 
structures. It was dear that they had rich 
and poor here, and that he was approadiing 
the dwellings of the poor. 

He heard a rhythmic sound in the street, 
as of a percussion instrument, and following 
it, found a female of the prevailing species, 
dressed somewhat diiferently from the other 
females, and pounding on a hollow cylinder 
of fairly large diameter. Other, more pierc- 
ing instruments, added sounds of their own, 
and then voices were lifted in song. He lin- 
gered, fascinated, and wished only that he 
had a sound-recorder to take permanent note 
of the strange music. 

He was not the only one who lingered. 
Half a dozen dilapidated males had gath- 
ered, attracted like him by the rhytiimic 
noise, and after a female had ended a strange 
exhortation which he did not fully under- 
stand, they all followed the company of 
musicians into a ramshackle building. In- 
side, he listened to other exhortations, and 
then had food thrust upon him. 


It was a bowl of soup, the first nutrient of 
this strange planet that he had eaten. The 
taste, as well as the quick ocular analysis he 
made, indicated that it was deficient in many 
of the chemicals that he needed for his own 
nutrition, but at least it had energy value, 
and he imbibed it slowly and thoughtfully. 
When he had finished, they asked him if 
he wanted more, but he said politely, "No, 
thank.” 

The young woman who had offered it to 
him said, "Oh, you’re a refugee, I suppose. 
Driven out of your native country?” 

He nodded. 

"Don’t you have any friends here?” 

He shook his head, and said, "No, 
thank.” 

"That’s too bad. You look as if you hadn’t 
eaten for a long time. Your face is awfully 
thin.” 

"Yes, thin.” He did not explain that for 
a member of his race he was not thin at all. 

"What’s your name, please?” 

"Name? What?” 

"How do people call you?” 

"Kayin. My name Kayin.” 

"Kane. That’s rather a strange name for 
a foreigner. Well, don’t worry, Mr. Kane, 
we’ll take care of you.” 

Her attitude helped erase the hostile en- 
counter of an hour before. When they finally 
showed him a cot, one of a row on which 
many men were already stretched out, he 
tried to reconcile the contradictory kinds of 
behavior he had met, and decided that the 
psychology of this race would prove more 
complicated than he had at first believed. 

The cot was extremely inconvenient, but 
somehow he managed to stretch out on it 
like the others. He slept little, and in the 
morning, when he awoke, it was with 
strained muscles and a sense of fatigue, but 
he was eager to see more of the world on 
which he found himself, and he left the next 
day, to continue his wanderings. During the 
hours that followed, he covered many miles 
of ground. With ears and mind open, he 
picked up more and more words, and by 
evening he was fairly confident in his ability 
to make himself understood in almost any 
situation. 

He went hungry that day, but in the eve- 
ning he slept much more comfortably at the 
foot of an old tree on a vacant lot. Far above 


TASK OF KAY IN 


he could see the star from which he had 
come. He stared at it impersonally for a 
short time, wondering whether he would 
see his own planet again. Then he fell into 
a half-sleep, one that rested him, though still 
leaving his senses partly alert. 

He was becoming more accustomed to the 
rather short day-and-night rhythm of the 
planet, and he awoke at the first faint signs 
of daylight before anyone had noticed him. 

That day he encountered groups of men 
congregated about dingy little buildings on a 
dingy street. He found that they were seek- 
ing employment, and knowing that the best 
way to learn about a strange race was to 
study the manner in which the people 
worked, he joined one of the groups. But 
there was not a single occupation with re- 
gard to which he could claim experience, 
and he was hired finally to do heavy, but 
unskilled labor, at eighty cents an hour. 

The work was more difficult for him than 
for the others. He looked like them, but they 
had muscles which he simply did not possess. 
He was so clumsy at lifting rocks that an- 
other man, with whom he was working, said 
finally in exasperation, "Didn’t you ever lift 
anything before? Look, pal, do it like this. 
Bend at the knees, see? That’s it, like this — 
no, you’re doing it all wrong!” 

I T WAS a nuisance, it might even be dan- 
gerous, to be stared at so closely. The 
fact was that his knees simply would not 
bend as human knees did. They were jointed 
in quite another fashion, and no surface 
similarities could conceal the fact that in 
action there was all the difference of two 
worlds between them. 

He said, "Sorry. I — injured.” 

“Oh, can’t bend them, huh? This is no 
job for you, pal.” 

"Am stranger. Know not — what else.” 
"Yeah, it’s tough.” 

He returned to his work again, this time 
warmed by the other’s sympathy, and less 
uneasy about being observed. And as he 
worked, he thought sardonically of what they 
would think on his home planet if they 
knew. 

He was sure that his enemies would have 
roared with laughter. Here was Kayin, the 
one they had feared for his brilliant mind, 
for his knowledge of science, for his prac- 


tical skill. They had outwitted him — with 
the odds on their side, it was true — driven 
him a hunted creature past strange stars, and 
forced him to come to ground again in the 
guise of one of the meanest of a mean and 
unintelligent race. And even in the humble 
position to which he had been reduced, he 
could not hold up his end of the work. 

He clenched his jaws grimly at the 
thought, and the very motion made him real- 
ize that in no way was he like the others, 
that even so simple a matter as the number 
and shape of his teeth might give him away. 
Unintelligent as they were, once they took 
the trouble to look with some care, they 
would know a creature who was not one of 
them. 

On the second day of work he did arouse 
suspicion, but at first not from the other 
workers. The creature that bared its teeth 
and barked at him was a dog. For a time 
Kayin found the animal’s attention embar- 
rassing. He threw a stone at the beast, but 
it ran only a short distance, and stopped to 
bark again. He had an idea of w'hat the 
trouble was. That day he had replaced his 
worn trousers by a new' and baggy pair of 
overalls, not yet saturated with the scent of 
human beings, and the dog had noticed his 
own faint but strange odor. Now it was 
making a nuisance of itself, and drawing 
everyone’s attention to him. 

'That mutt don’t like you, Mac,” said a 
foreman who passed by. 

“Funny about dogs, the w'ay they bark at 
some people,” someone laughed. 

Kayin threw' another stone, but the beast 
dodged and continued to bark. His audience 
was grow'ing now', and Kayin’s skin began 
to tw'itch nervously, in a way that itself 
might have drawn an audience if they had 
been in a mood to notice such details of 
behavior. "I patted cat this morning,” he 
said apologetically. "Crazy dog smells cat.” 

He would have them all staring at him 
if this went on much longer, and he knew 
that he had to act quickly. Looking around 
him, he spied a compressed air hose lying 
on the ground. He picked it up, turned on 
the air, and directed the nozzle at the dog. 
The blast knocked the animal head over 
heels, and sent him howling on his way. 
Everyone laughed, and Kayin turned back 
to his work in relief. But from now on he 


PLANET STORIES 


42 

knew that he must wear no new clothes. 

As the work progressed, his attention 
turned from the immediate tasks at hand, 
and he began to wonder what its purpose 
was. There seemed to be hundreds of men, 
all engaged in menial tasks, all part of some 
greater overall plan. He began to wonder, 
too, if people who could make such plans 
could be so unintelligent as he had first 
assumed. Or was it simply that their intelli- 
gence had not developed, that they lacked 
the background of science to make the most 
of their minds, to use the resources their 
planet possessed? 

A rough voice, almost the twin of that 
first rough voice of two days before, 
growled, "Hey, you, wake up and get 
movin’. Whaddya think you’re gettin’ paid 
for?” 

He swung his pick without looking up. 
The foreman had no idea that the tall for- 
eigner he knew as Kane was staring at him 
curiously with tiny camouflaged eyes that 
quite literally grew in the back of the 
strangely shaped head, trying to understand 
what made the human being tick. 

By the end of a week Kayin was confident 
that he knew the language well enough to 
start reading it. He went to a public sdiool 
which he found was open in the evenings, 
and there joined a class where someone ex- 
plained the alphabet, and made clear to 
foreigners that English was a language full 
of traps and pitfalls. Kayin absorbed the 
information eagerly, but after the third les- 
son he found the pace much too slow, and 
did not return. He had never before en- 
countered a language of so strange a struc- 
ture, and the adual making of the sounds 
gave him trouble, but the basic principles of 
language study were as valid here as on his 
home planet, and he learned rapidly. By 
the end of a month he could read. 

By the end of the same month he had 
learned, too, the nature of the project on 
which he was working. On several occasions, 
the engineer in charge had passed by him 
to exchange a few words with the foreman 
and once with the man who had ordered the 
building. 

The words had been significant. There 
could be no mistake, for Kayin had come 
across them in his reading. "Laboratory” 
had a very definite meaning. And there were 


such expressions as "incubation tanks,” and 
"thermostat controls.” All in all, enough to 
let him know that they were engaged in 
constructing a plant for the manufacture of 
biochemical substances. 

He knew that there were biochemical 
plants already in existence, scattered over 
the civilized part of the planet, and the 
thought of great danger did not occur to 
him. But he continued, as the men around 
him would have put it, to keep his ears open, 
and as time went on he became more and 
more disquieted. 

M eanwhile, his relations with the 
people amon'» whom he worked be- 
came almost human. They greeted him every 
day as one of themselves, asked casual ques- 
tions about the place from which he had 
come and the way he had lived, and accepted 
the answers as if with a quiet confidence 
that he was telling the truth. Once, in an 
access of good feeling, one of them had 
gone so far as to slap him amicably on the 
shoulder, and Kayin had experienced agony 
such as he had never felt before. But he 
managed to conceal the pain, and even to 
laugh weakly. He made sure, however, that 
a similar incident would never happen again. 
Whenever someone approached him too 
closely, he opened his extra eyes very 
slightly, ready to step aside at the touch of 
a too friendly hand. 

He had not realized how much his own 
attitude toward them had changed until the 
day an accident occurred. A large shelf of 
rock had unexpectedly turned up to block 
the excavation of a wide pit, and it had been 
necessary to shatter it with dynamite. But 
the explosive did not at first go off, and one 
of the men had gone back to see what was 
wrong. He had been just in time to be 
knocked down by the blast itself, and to be 
covered by the mass of dirt and broken 
rock that slid into the excavation. 

It was Kayin who ran for him first, dig- 
ging frantically away at the smothering 
mass, without regard for the fragments that 
continued to rain down upon him. And after 
he had reached the man, who was uncon- 
scious, but still breathing, it was Kayin who 
had wondered why on this Earth he had 
taken the risk for the sake of a creature 
who meant so little to him. There was an- 


TASK OF KATIN 


other risk as well, he found, when they 
summoned a doctor to treat the injured 
man, and someone suggested that Kayin 
had been injured too. But Kayin quickly 
shrugged off the idea that he needed treat- 
ment, and went back at once to his work. 
He wanted no doctor discovering what un- 
usual arms and legs and internal organs he 
had. 

In the days that followed he continued 
to wonder at himself. Working together 
with these men, he had changed. But he 
must be careful, he knew, not to change too 
far. They had only, he was certain, to see 
him as he was, to realize his difference from 
them, and their friendliness would change 
to hate, causing them to turn from him with 
fear and loathing. 

The building had reached the stage of 
scaffolding, and he was still at work. It was 
now that he learned the full truth about the 
project which was soon to come into opera- 
tion. 

He was on the outside of the building, and 
two of the men in charge were nearby. One 
of them, shrewd and elderly, had financed 
the building The other, in his thirties, was 
the scientist who had invented the process. 
They were speaking in low tones, tones 
which no human being standing in Kayin’s 
position would have been able to under- 
stand. 

"You’re sure, Blayson, that there’s no 
danger?’’ the older man was saying. 

The scientist smiled. "There’s always 
some danger, Mr. Lymer, especially when 
you try something new. But there’s nothing 
we shouldn’t be able to control.’’ 

"I still don’t think that you know too 
much about what you’re doing.’’ 

"I’ve admitted that myself. But we get 
results, don’t we? We’ll comer the world 
market, Mr. Lymer. Name your antibiotic 
and we’ll make it. And in addition to any- 
thing now being sold, we’ll have dozens 
that nobody has even imagined. I think I’ve 
given you enough evidence to convince you 
of that.” 

"I suppose you have. But this use of cos- 
mic rays makes me uneasy. You still don’t 
know enough about them.” 

It was at this point that Kayin’s third 
and fourth eyes, usually so completely con- 
cealed, popped wide open in surprise and 


43 

terror. It was fortunate that no one took the 
trouble to look at him at that moment. 

The younger man was saying confidently, 
"We ll control them. All we need to know 
is that they’re high energy, higher than any- 
thing we can produce here on earth, and 
that we can concentrate them in a way no 
one else can. There’s nothing to fear, noth- 
ing that ordinary precautions shouldn’t en- 
able us to handle.” 

Nothing, Kayin thought, but the danger 
of depopulating most of a planet. His mind 
went back to what had happened on the 
second planet of his own sun, what had 
almost happened on the fourth planet. 
Within the space of a few hundred centads 
of time, the second planet, with its popula- 
tion of four billion, had lost every inhabi- 
tant, and become a sterile monument of a 
dead civilization. Only the warning of what 
had already taken place had enabled the sec- 
ond planet to survive. 

And in this place too, disaster would 
strike quickly. Kayin had begun to read 
more and more, and he knew what was tak- 
ing place here. Science had developed 
quickly, but sporadically. Vast regions had 
remained untouched by it, masses of people 
knew nothing of it but the name and the 
fact that it could perform miracles. True, 
they had learned that certain discoveries 
might lead to disaster as well as to the im- 
provement of their lives, but they still failed 
to test their discoveries fully before using 
them, they still failed to exercise the nec- 
essary controls. 

The young man, Blayson, had made his 
discovery ahead of its proper time. At the 
rate at which human science was progressing, 
thought Kayin, at least a hundred years 
would have to pass before such a discovery 
could be considered safe. At the present 
stage, it simply could not be controlled. The 
concentrated cosmic rays w’ould, as Blayson 
evidently anticipated, cause tremendous 
mutations in living organisms, in the molds 
and mycetes of different kinds, it would lead 
to the manufacture of useful antibiotics. But 
they would also lead to the production of 
entirely new forms of sub-microscopic life, 
forms not susceptible to ordinary methods of 
sterilization, forms that would multiply with 
inexorable speed. These forms produced 
from bits of human tissue would inevitably 


2W PLANET 

be deadly to human beings and related 
species. 

He himself, thought Kayin, possessed of 
a different body chemistry, might escape. 
But he would be the only intelligent crea- 
ture to do so. Aand after the viruses had 
done their work, the planet, in its desolation 
and sterility, would resemble the second 
planet of his own star. 

If he had learned of the imminence of 
disaster at the time he first arrived, he would 
hardly have been affected. He would have 
hated to see a race disappear. He had the 
scientist’s desire to keep any race, even the 
least useful, alive so that he might study it, 
and at the very worst, write an article about 
it. But now — and this he realized almost to 
his amazement — he felt practically human 
himself. It must be the way he was living 
and working, the way the others treated him 
on the job. He did not want to see them 
annihilated. 

H e was the only one to know the dan- 
ger. He realized at once that he could 
tell no one. Blayson and Lymer had eyes 
only on the fortunes they intended to make, 
and they would have refused to beleve any- 
thing that stood in the way of those 
fortunes. Nor could he go to anyone else. 
There would be questions — 

He imagined himself trying to inform the 
Mayor of the city. Some underling would be 
sure to meet him. "You say there's danger, 
Mr. Kayin? That how you pronounce it? For- 
eign-sounding name. Where’d you come 
from?” 

He would have to invent answers in ad- 
vance for every possible embarrassing ques- 
tion. And then would come the most embar- 
rassing of all; 

"How do you know there’s danger?” 
There was no answer to that. Could he 
say that he had worked in the same field of 
research himself? Or could he give them the 
example of what had happened on another 
planet?” 

It was a problem that he would have to 
solve by himself. He racked his head, and 
found no simple solution. He had his op- 
tical analyzer, and one or two additional 
trifles like it, but there was no special appa- 
ratus he could use, no weapons. Outside of 
his scientfic knowledge and his non-human 


STORIES 

brain, he had only the same weapons as 
the human beings themselves. And these 
were hardly enough to put an end for gcx)d 
to a project on which so many human beings 
had built their hopes. 

The buildings approached completion, the 
laboratory equipment began to be installed. 
And then, finally, when delay was no longer 
possible, on the eve of the very day that was 
to see the plant put into operation, Kayin 
acted. 

He knew that until work actually began 
there would be but a single night watchman, 
and it was this man at whom he struck first. 
A single carefully amed blow with a padded 
club produced unconsciousness. Kayin did 
not strike hard, but he struck hard enough. 
As the watchman fell, Kayin seized the man; 
bound and gagged him. 

Then he entered the building and began 
to destroy. 

He started with the cosmic ray collector, 
working quietly and efficiently, and concen- 
trating on the electronic and magnetic parts. 
These had been ordered long before the 
building itself had been begun. 'They would 
be hard to replace. 

He passed on to the giant incubator vats, 
and finally turned his attention to the collec- 
tion of formulas which reposed in the files. 
These were important, but he knew that they 
were not enough. The most important for- 
mulas of all lay in the mind of the man who 
had developed the process, and that was, for 
the moment at least, beyond him. What 
Kayin was doing now was playing for time. 

He was setting a match to the papers of 
the last file when he heard a voice. More 
time had passed than he realized, and they 
had come early on this day that was to have 
seen the beginning of a great enterprise. 

They must already have noted the absence 
of the watchman. Now he heard a gasp 
from Lymer, a groan that must have come 
from Blayson. Then there was cursing, slow, 
bitter and steady. Then footsteps, and Lymer 
was standing at the door of the office and 
shouting, "Here he is!” 

Blayson was shouting to someone outside, 
and I^yin knew that in a moment the entire 
building would be swarming with people. 
He promptly tossed one of the fiiles at Lymer, 
saw the man shamble and fall in an effort 
to avoid being hit, and was past the door 


TASK OF KAY IN 


before the enraged man could scramble to 
his feet again. 

Then he was in the great incubation room, 
with its monstrous vats, heading for the 
opposite end. But before he could reach it, 
a door swung open. A policeman appeared, 
and shouted, "Hey, you — stop!” 

He dashed out through a side door into 
a small control room. He locked the door 
behind him. He heard a dub pound furi- 
ously upon it, and tlie pounding ceased as 
the policeman decided against a further 
waste of time here. Kayin ran to the other 
door. As he did so the knob turned. He 
threw all his weight against the door and 
turned the key. Men pounded on both doors, 
and he looked around for windows. There 
were none. He was locked in. 

He heard Blayson’s voice, "Open up! You 
can’t get away!” 

There was, it was true, no way out. But 
Kayin said calmljr, "Stay away, or I’ll blow 
up the building.’ 

A fter the destruction he had already ac- 
complished, they had no way of know- 
ing that he was bluffing. The pounding 
stopped. Through the door he heard the 
whispered sounds of consultation. Then 
Blayson’s voice again, "Come out. We won’t 
liurt you." 

"I realize that.” 

' You realize — ” 

"You think that I am afraid, do you not?” 
There was surprise in the tones of Blay- 
son’s reply. "You don’t sound crazy, but — ” 
"But what other reason could I have had 
for destroying so much valuable equip- 
ment?” 

He heard Lymer say, "Over a hundred 
thousand dollars’ worth. That cosmic ray 
collector cost at least that.” 

A policeman’s voice; "You saw him, Mr. 
Lymer. Recognize him?” 

"No, never saw him before in my life.” 
Blayson shouted again, this time with un- 
concealed anger, "Come on out.” 

"With pleasure. But first I should like to 
talk to you.” 

"You’ll talk later.” 

"No.” He knew that later they would 
not listen to him, and he realized that if he 
could convince Blayson of the danger of 
the project, his battle would be won. "Do 


3S 

you want to know why I did so much dam- 
age, Mr. Blayson?” 

"You’ve already answered that.” 

"No, I am not insane. It is you who are 
failing to use your mind properly. Your 
method is extremely dangerous.” 

"How do you know?” 

"I have made similar studies.” 

"That’s absurd. No one on earth has done 
anything like this.” 

"I didn’t mention Earth,” thought Kayin. 
Aloud, he said patiently, "You are mistaken. 
Your experiments are not new, and it is 
known — ’’ he did not say where it was 
known — "it is known that they can lead to 
disaster. They can produce microorganisms 
of a virulence never before seen here.” 

"You’re just imagining things!” 

"I do not imagine. At this period, your 
discovery is of too treacherous a nature to 
be used.” 

Blayson was silent, and Kayin hoped that 
he was thinking of something else than 
breaking down the door. 

"You will not be the first, Mr. Blayson, 
to have surpressed a discovery of so great 
significance.” 

"I don’t believe you. Open the door.” 

"In a moment. But think of what I have 
said.” 

"Open the door.” 

"Half a moment now. You do not care to 
listen further?” 

A policeman growled, "He’s stalling. 
We’ll break it open.” 

"No need for that,” said Kayin. "I shall 
come out. Perhaps if I speak to you face to 
face you will believe me.” 

He removed the jacket and shirt and tie 
to which he had become so accustomed these 
past few months. He stretched his muscles 
freely, and smiled a bitter smile to himself. 
He said, "The door opens outward. Please 
give room.” 

He turned the key in the lock, and 
slammed the door open. Then he leaped 
forward. 

He could hear tlie shouts of horror, he 
could see them standing there petrified. It 
was a reaction that he had counted on. A 
policeman fired his revolver, but so excitedly 
that every bullet missed, while he yelled, 
"It’s not human. It’s not human!” 

The gravity was a little too great here for 


PLANET STORIES 


E6 

him to do any real flying, but at least his 
wings, unfolded at last, could take him high 
into the air in the great room, terrifying and 
confusing them. As he slowly floated down, 
he could see them racing around madly. He 
headed for the door to an outer room. A 
policeman who was standing in his path 
could not move his bulk out of the way in 
time. Kayin crashed into him and sent him 
sprawling. Then, from behind him, another 
policeman aimed a blow with the butt of his 
gun. With his extra eyes Kayin saw what 
was happening, and a blow of his great 
wings knocked the policeman down. 

Then he was running down the corridor, 
using his wings to give him a little extra 
speed. The door through which he had just 
come swung open again, and a bullet sang 
past him, tearing into the non-fleshy part 
of his wing. He hardly felt it. 

He was outside. 

The noise of the shooting had spread the 
alarm. Another policeman came running, 
took one look at him, closed his eyes, and 
swayed there. Kayin seized the man’s own 
club and hit him over the head with it. He 
dragged the unconscious body into a deep, 
clean, concrete-lined pit that had been re- 
served for some of the dangerously radio- 
active byproduct that he was now sure they 
would never make. In the dark of the pit, 
he stripped the policeman of the uniform. 
The man was broad across the shoulders, 
and the uniform fitted nicely across Kayin’s 
wings. 

Now he leaped out of the pit, adding his 
yells to those of the others. A car, the one 
in which Blayson and Lymer had arrived, 
was standing parked at the edge of the yard, 
and he slipped into it. He was out of tlie 
yard before they realized what was happen- 
ing. 

But a policeman’s uniform, he knew, was 
too conspicuous. A mile away, he stopped a 
puzzled truck driver, threatened the man 
with his revolver, and drove away a moment 
later with an extra, less conspicuous suit of 
clothes. He turned on the radio and learned, 
as he had suspected, that an alarm for him 
had already been broadcast. 

He left the car on a deserted side road, 
and changed into his truck driver’s outfit. He 
knew enough now about human customs to 
feel momentarily safe. And he knew enough 


also to realize that they would institute a na- 
tionwide search for a strange creature with 
wings. He would not be safe for long. He 
had to get back to his ship, of which, fortu- 
nately, they knew nothing. They might sus- 
pect, but they could have no idea of where 
he had hidden it. 

T hat night, still dressed as a truck 
driver, he broke into a factory that 
made electrical appliances. When he left, he 
had with him most of what he needed for 
repairs. 

It was two days later that he reached his 
ship with a supply of food. He hoped that 
he had been unobserved, but he could not 
be sure. He set to work, using the Earth- 
made supplies to patch up, in makeshift 
fashion, the damage caused by the crash. 

Another two days and the ship would 
operate. He was short on fuel, but if he 
looked for it, he knew he could find enough 
to send him on his way and leave this planet 
for good. 

He realized now that he didn’t want to 
leave. In the days he had spent here, he had 
gradually lost some of his feeling of lone- 
liness. Almost despite themselves, these 
human beings had made him feel like one 
of them. Their planet would never take the 
place of the one he had left, but in many 
ways it had become a second home to him. 

He had made it uninhabitable for himself. 
If he had said nothing, done nothing, then 
no one would have suspected, and he would 
have been allowed to stay — until disaster 
struck them all. 

At least he had delayed that. The radio 
that night brought him the news that Blay- 
son, who had been slightly injured in the 
struggle, had been taken to a hospital, his 
mind temporarily gone under the shock of 
what had happened. He would be unable, 
for the time, to reconstruct what Kayin had 
destroyed. Lymer, disheartened by the loss, 
had announced that he had no plans for 
rebuilding the factory. Despite their stupid- 
ity, Kayin had won them a respite. 

He had won nothing for himself. The 
following day he heard warning sounds, and 
saw groups of men closing in around the 
ship. He was pleased to see that, despite all 
difficulties, they had traced the path he had 
taken. They were not so stupid after all.

TASK OF KAYIN 


He went into his ship, and the door slid 
shut. Night was falling, and in the darkness 
the ship leaped upward at a sharp angle. 
Now there would be hundreds of people 
who saw the shooting star, but this time a 
star that shot upward. 

He rose to a height of twenty miles, and 
remained at that level, cruising slowlly. Far 
above, he could see through the viewplates 
the star — Vega, they called it here — which 
was his native sun. Already an exile from 
his homeland, he was now being exiled from 
his second home. 

Suddenly he knew that being exiled once 
was enough. He was tired of fleeing through 
space, tired of making friends and then be- 
ing forced to leave them. He had made a 
home here, and here he would stand and 
fight. 

Below him, the surface of the planet was 
now rocky and deserted. The ship began to 


sink. It was still dark, and the vessel came 
to rest slowly and inconspicuously upon a 
craggy peak where there was little danger 
that any human being would stumble upon 
it. Far below he could see the outline of a 
town, picked out of the darkness by light 
reflected from clouds above. Looking 
through a distance viewer he could even 
distinguish the individual lights, and he was 
able to read a sign that flaunted its message 
boldly alongside a bridge: WELCOME TO 
HARDENDALE. 

He smiled, and said softly, in the lan- 
guage that was no longer strange to him, 
"I accept the invitation.” 

Stretching his wings, he parachuted down 
through the darkness to level ground, pre- 
pared to become once more a member by 
adoption of the human race. And this time, 
as he walked cautious and alone through 
the night, he no longer felt lonely.

By W. BRADFORD MARTIN 

Out beyond hyper-space soared the transmuted Terran 
— to Trygon II — where all mad men die 
willingly for the Empress. 

I T COULD be said that the Resistance Palomar, for while the astronomers pro- 
began at the moment the great spaceship pounded tl.eories as to its origin and 
from Trygon II first appeared as an un- composition, it entered our atmosphere and 
known body on the photographic plates at came to earth on the runways of Idlewild 
SS 



Airport, just outside of what was then New 
York City. Nothing need be said of the 
panic caused by its coming. 

Three Trj’gonians went immediately in a 
ground car to the United Nations Building 
in the city. The records of their pronounce- 
ment have, unfortunately, been lost, but from 
subsequent events it has been established 
that they granted Terra fifteen days to submit 
to Trygonia. 

Then they returned to space. 

Fifteen days later they returned and 
crushed the feeble opposition they encoun- 
tered. 


R OSS SAVAGE was tired of seeing noth- 
ing but white; the walls and ceiling of 
his small, windowless room, the few pieces 
of utilitarian furniture and the sheets cover- 
ing the narrow bed, which sagged under the 
weight of his muscularly massive, six-foot 
five-inch frame. He was tired too, of the 
white bandages on his hands and, although 
he could not see them, the white bandages 
that swathed his head and face, leaving only 
slits for his eyes and mouth. 

Today is the day, he thought. Why don’t 
they come? As if in answer to his unspoken 
question the door latch clicked. Savage

turned his head stifHy to watdi the door 
open. As it swung wide the doctor entered, 
followed by General Strathmore and two 
nurses guiding a wheeled tray. 

"It’s time to take them oflF,” the doctor 
said. No one answered, but Savage felt his 
hands grow sweaty in their wrappings. 

As the group reached the bed a nurse 
handed the doctor a pair of surgical scissors. 
He bent over Savage as he said, "We’ll take 
the hands first.” 

There was no sound other than the snip- 
snip of the scissors as the doctor carefully 
cut through the gauze. Finally the sound 
stopped and Savage looked at his hands. 
'They were white and soft, but there were 
no scars to betray the fingerprint change. 

The doctor permitted himself a small 
smile of satisfaction, but the room was preg- 
nant with tension as he turned his attention 
to the gauze covering Savage’s head. 

The snijj-snip came again as the cold steel 
slid slowly over his skin. An eternity passed 
before the sound again ceased and a nurse 
carefully removed the freed gauze. For a 
long moment there was no sound and Savage 
looked anxiously from face to face and tried 
to interpret what he read there. The nurses 
stared in disgust and horror while the doctor 
looked satisfied. The General beamed. 

"Beautiful job,” the General said finally, 
and the doctor nodded in agreement. 

"Let me see,” Savage croaked through 
stiff lips. 

A nurse took the hand mirror from the 
bedside table and held it in front of him. 
From the glass the bearded face of a Try- 
gonian stared at him; there was no mistaking 
the narrow chin, the high, broad cheekbones 
and aquiline nose. 

A lmost a month later Savage stood at 
attention in the General’s office. He 
wore the flamboyantly brilliant uniform of 
a Trygonian officer. Medals and orders 
sparkled on his breast. His new face wore 
a sardonic scowl. 

"Fleet captain Choon reporting, sir,” he 
said, and the General’s stern face relaxed to 
a half smile. 

"Sit down, Ross,” the General invited and 
indicated the chair beside his desk. "So 
you’re ready to go, eh? How do you like 
yourself?” 


"Well,” Savage smiled, "I have to keep 
myself from going for my gun when I see 
myself in a mirror, but outside of that I’m 
pretty used to it by now.” 

"We’.'e made tremendous strides in the 
twenty years since we went underground. I 
guess it was the pressure. But Phillips told 
me that by every test you’re a Trygonian. 
I hope however, that you haven’t become one 
emotionally. That was the one thing we were 
afraid of when we decided to use the Cere- 
graph. Choon died, of course, but how was 
it for you?” 

"Nothing to it, sir. I just seemed to go to 
sleep and when I awoke I knew everything 
Choon knew, but Doctor Phillips almost 
drove me crazy testing me to find out 
whether I’d picked up Choon’s mental out- 
look. Apparently, though, the Ceregraph 
transfers only knowledge, not emotions.” 

"Thank the Lord,” exclaimed the General 
heavily. 

"I want to thank you for this oppor- 
tunity,” Savage said. "I’ve wanted to do 
something concrete against them since they 
killed my parents twenty years ago.” 

“Whether or not you can do something 
concrete is up to you.” The General was 
stern again. "You were chosen because of 
your physical and mental qualifications. You 
just happened to be Choon’s exact physical 
double. Fortunately he was rather shorter 
than the average Trygonian.” 

"Doctor Phillips told me that, except for 
size, there is no anatomical difference be- 
tween the Trygonians and ourselves,” said 
Savage. “It is his theory that the highest in- 
telligent life form on any planet suitable to 
the evolution of intelligent life will be a 
humanoid type.” 

"That may be possible, but exact duplica- 
tion seems strange,” the General said. 
"Although I’m interested in Tr)’gon I 
haven’t had a chance to read your report. 
I think you have time to fill me in on some 
of the details. Why do they call their planet 
Trygon II?” 

"Trygon is tlie name of their sun,” ex- 
plained Savage. "Their system consists of 
three planets, Trygon I, II and III. Until 
about seven hundred years ago only the 
middle planet, Trygon II was inhabited by 
their race. Then they discovered a method 
of utilizing Solar energy directly and what 


SPOILERS OF THE SPACEWAYS 


amounted to a social revolution took place. 

"At the time, Trygon II was divided into 
a number of countries. The discovery was 
made in a country called Czur and with it 
Czur conquered the rest of the planet. They 
used pretty brutal methods, but they welded 
the entire planet into one country using one 
language and having one ruler. 

"Space was the next step and they ex- 
plored the other planets. The innermost one 
was hot and lush and eventually they tamed 
It and now they grow all their food there. 
The third planet, as might be expected was 
cold and bare, but it was fantastically rich 
in minerals. They transferred their mining 
and manufacturing to the third planet, leav- 
ing Trygon II the center of trade, the rich 
and the military. 

"There are a number of commercial space- 
ports but only one military. It’s near the 
capital city, named Czur in honor of the 
country that started it all. 

"Two hundred years ago they ventured 
into deep space. Earth is the fifth humanoid 
planet they have conquered.” 

"That’s quite a history,” said tlie General. 
"What form of government do they have?” 

"Autocratic. The Emperor is the supreme 
authority, but the High Commissioner works 
out the details and sees that the orders are 
carried out. Ail military matters are in the 
hands of the Emporer and in that respect the 
High Commissioner is just a figure head. 
As you can imagine there is a g(x>d deal of 
intrigue.” 

"Yes, I can see that there would be,” 
agreed the General. He glanced at the wall 
clock. "But it’s almost H-hour.” 

"Are there any last orders?” Savage asked. 

The General smiled wryly. "It might be 
said that there were no first orders. You’re 
on your own, Ross. We don’t know what you 
can do, but if you can get into one of their 
intrigue groups you should be able to do 
something. The rank of Fleet captain carries 
a lot of weight. All I can say is be careful 
and do your best. 

"’Fhe skeleton crew is moving out and 
the station is going on automatic as soon as 
you leave.” 

Savage stood up, saluted and then the 
General took his hand and shook it warmly. 
Savage turned and walked out of the office 
without looking back.

Outside two guards waited and they 
walked together down a long hall to a bare, 
cement-walled room. There was only one 
way to make sure that he would look like 
an escaped prisoner and they had to make 
sure. So they fought and when they were 
through, his uniform was a sad caricature 
of its former splendor and he had the be- 
ginnings of a black eye. 

He shook hands with the two men and 
then went up tliree flights of stairs where 
the Trygonian patrol ship waited. There was 
no one in sight as he climbed into the ship 
and roared away, but anti-aircraft guns 
opened up almost immediately. Savage 
smiled grimly as he saw the shells burst a 
safe distance from him. 

T hen, as he was almost out of range, 
the ship lurdied from the blast of a 
near miss. A hole appeared in the hull be- 
side him and he saw his sleeve rip and 
redden as a fragment cut across his arm. He 
switched on the automatics and cursed the 
unknown gunner as he crudely bandaged the 
flesh wound with part of his already torn 
shirt. At least, he thought finally, it would 
add verisimilitude to his story. 

An hour later he crash-landed on the out- 
skirts of what had once been Denver, 
Colorado, and what was now the Trygonian 
Capital for North America. Then be settled 
down to wait for tlie Trygonians. 

Something less than ten minutes passed 
before a ground car skidded to a stop near 
the wrecked ship. Two Trygonian soldiers 
jumped out with hand-blasters at the ready. 
More sedately, as befitted his rank, a Senior 
Lieutenant followed and Savage walked 
briskly to meet him. The Lieutenant q^ed 
Savage dubiously for a brief moment and 
then snapped to tlie salute. 

"At ease,” Savage ordered. "Take me to 
Headquarters immediately.” 

"Yes, sir,” the Lieutenant replied and 
followed Savage into the car. It was evident 
that he was wondering why such an exalted 
personage as a full Fleet captain should ap- 
pear. in a single place patrol ship and in this 
condition, but Savage let him wonder. The 
soldiers reentered the car and they sped away 
with a full-throated roar. 

Savage remained grimly silent as they 
roared through the Trygonian capital. Try-

gonians were everywhere, but still Eartlunen 
predominated, and Savage wondered what 
had induced them to remain. There were 
probably many reasons, he decided, for man 
in spite of everything must live somewhere 
and he must eat. After twenty years they 
were probably used to it. 

He had lived briefly in Denver as a child, 
but nothing remained now of the city he 
had known. The old buildings had been 
blasted during the invasion and starkly func- 
tional ferro-concrete had replaced the 
rubble. At the very site of the old State 
Capitol the Trygonians had raised a towering 
structure to house the offices of the High 
Command. 

They filed into the building and, as the 
Lieutenant had done, the honor guard eyed 
him dubiously before snapping to attention. 
Savage strode haughtily between them and 
finally, after a succession of guards and 
lesser officers, he was ushered into the pres- 
ence of Vice Admiral Harna lor-Hama. 

"Fleet captain Choon," he announced. 

The Admiral was tremendous. He tow- 
ered a full foot over Savage and his heavily 
decorated uniform was stretched tightly over 
a majestic paunch. His great jowls moved 
loosely as he boomed: 

"Choon, by the great Galatic Gods. I 
knew your father on the old Arrano. He was 
the best Executive Officer I ever had. 

"But sit down — ^you may leave. Lieutenant 
— and tell me what you are doing here. 
What happened to your uniform?" 

"I w'as taken by the Terrans.” The Ad- 
miral’s eyes became iq' chips. "I have just 
escaped from aTerran stronghold . . ." 

"Have you, by the Eternal Stars,” the 
Admiral interrupted. "Too many of our 
men have vanished in spite of reprisals, but 
this is the first definite proof of an organized 
movement. Where is it?” 

"About five hundred ling North in the 
mountains,” Savage said and the Admiral 
went into action. With his left hand he 
flipped a switch and a colored relief map of 
the area sprang into view on the wall, while 
with his right hand he pushed up a row of 
communicator buttons. 

"Ready three attack units for immediate 
takeoff,” he roared. "I will take personal 
command. Have my car at gate three.” 

With the buttons still up he asked. "What 


is the exact location?” 

Savage moved quickly to the map and 
examined it closely. After a moment’s hesi- 
tation he said, “As closely as I can make it, 
it was zone, three, sector five. It was well 
camouflaged.” 

The Admiral roared tlie location into the 
communicator and slammed down the but- 
tons. With swiftness surprising for one of 
his bulk he strode to the door. 

"You will come with me in my flagship, 
Choon. These miserable savages won’t give 
us much of a fight, but it may be of some 
interest. We’ll both be decorated for this.” 

II 

A n hour and twenty minutes later the 
fifteen unit fleet was hovering high over 
the Canadian Rockies, zone three, sector five. 
At the Admiral’s direction Savage examined 
the mountain below through the electronic 
scatmers. Although he knew there was no 
one left in the hidden cavern below him it 
was an effort to point it out, it had been his 
home for a long time. 

The Admiral barked co-ordinates into the 
microphone and then barked an order. One 
ship detached itself from the formation and 
dived toward the hidden entrance of the 
cavern, its heat guns burning great swaths 
through trees and brush. It made a second 
pass and antiquated anti-aircraft guns 
opened up, tearing the air futiley. 

Savage barely suppressed a start of sur- 
prise before remembering that the guns were 
automatic-radar controlled. 

The Admiral roared into the microphone 
again: "Squadron three cover, one and two 
land and deploy for attack. Remember, I 
want prisoners.” 

As the ships descended the anti-aircraft 
guns opened up again from their now re- 
vealed turrets and as they fired the Trj'- 
gonian guns blasted them into so much 
molten scrap. Finally they were completely 
silenced and the attack ships landed and the 
soldiers deployed. They were almost to the 
entrance and Savage was beginning to won- 
der what had happened to the trips, when 
an Atomic blast took away the side of the 
mountain. 

The troops and five Trygonian ships 
went with it. 


SPOILERS OF THE SPACEWAYS 


The Admiral had had within his grasp a 
stronghold of the resistance and he had lost 
it. It could be argued that tlie loss could not 
have been avoided, but in his service such 
an argument was not admissable. A full 
report was sent to Trygon II and both the 
Admiral and Choon were recalled. 

The three ships which first found Terra 
Had been equipped with ordinary Space 
Drive and had been in Space for more than 
eighteen years. Lacking a radio Which would 
cover the immense distance, one of the ships 
had taken a seebnd eighteen years to make 
a report of the conquest. But in the mean- 
time both space radio and Space Warp had 
been achieved, and forty-five days after the 
abortive attack they were on Trygon II. 

They were placed under house arrest in 
hotel suites and two days later the Admiral 
was given a swift trial. He was demoted 
three grades and then given permission to 
retire. 

Having extracted the penalty for failure 
from its Admiral the Supreme Command 
would next turn its attention to erring Fleet 
captain; capture by the enemy was bad 
enough, but he had given the information 
which had led to serious losses. Confined in 
his suite he waited anxiously for two days 
more without receiving word and then he 
received a visit from a Captain Lin. 

After identifying himself, Lin said, "You 
are in serious trouble with the High Com- 
missioner, sir, and not about your capture 
or the attack on the Terran stronghold. At 
least, not directly. You had better sit down 
while I tell you what happened.” 

"I will stand, thank you,” Savage said 
coldly. 

"As you wish, sir. Its hard to believe, but 
every file and record concerning you for the 
past two years, as well as the records of the 
trial have been either destroyed or rewritten. 
Officially, you are here on leave. And to top 
it off lor-Harna was found dead this morn- 
ing. The evidence pointed to suicide, but it 
is believed to be murder.” 

"What?” exclaimed Savage and found a 
chair. 

"The High Commissioner is blowing his 
jets,” continued Lin with thinly veiled ex- 
citement. "He doesn’t know how it was 
done, but he suspects that the Empress or- 
dered it. If that’s the case his hands are tied, 


S3 

but in the meantime he'll do anything to 
get you. 

“I have been instructed to advise you to 
deny everything except that you are indeed 
home on leave. Incidentally, no one is to 
know of my visit.” 

"How about the guards?” Savage asked. 

Lin smiled. "I am in command of the 
guard detail. I must return to duty now, but 
please remember that you are a person of 
extreme importance and as such you must 
be very careful.” 

Before Savage could reply, Lin turned on 
his heel and left the room, leaving him to 
ponder this sudden turn of events. How 
could anyone change everything so com- 
pletely, he wondered. If it was on the Em- 
press’ order, why should she take such an 
interest in him? Why should Lin give him 
tlie information? Who did he represent? 

An hour later a knock on the door 
brought him out of his private Hell. 

T he panel slid open and a Lieutenant in 
the jet black uniform of the Fleet CID 
strode in importantly. Behind him came 
four enlisted men in the same uniform, two 
of whom planted themselves firmly beside 
the door with their hands on open-holstered 
blasters. The other two wheeled in an equip- 
ment table. 

Savage waited with silent calm while the 
Lieutenant crossed the room and drew him- 
self to attention. Then he asked sharply: 

"What is the meaning of this intnision? 
I demand every courtesy of house arrest and 
this does not fall in that category.” 

"I am under the explicit orders: of the 
High Commissioner,” the officer said icily. 
"Any complaints should be addressed to 
him. I have also been instructed to take any 
necessary action to carry out my orders.” 
"And what are they?” Savage parried. 
"Please be good enough to follow me to 
the table,” the officer said, fingering his 
blaster. Savage followed. 

At the table the officer flipped a switch 
and from somewhere in the apparatus came 
a muflSed hum. Then a flat plate set into the 
surface of the table glowed and Savage was 
instructed to place his hands, palms down, 
on the plate. He did so and the officer 
pushed a button. 

"You may remove your hands,” he said 


54 PLANET 

and bent over a double eyepiece. After ad- 
justing and readjusting a pair of knobs he 
raised his head and gave Savage a surprised 
look. He bent down again and made new 
adjustments. At last he straightened up. His 
voice lacked some of its former arrogance 
as he said, "Thank you, sir.” 

The Lieutenant and his men left without 
saying anything further and Savage won- 
dered what they had tried to prove with a 
fingerprint check. Apparently, however, the 
High Commissioner was covering every 
angle. The episode gave Savage a momentary 
feeling of pleasure, which however was 
quickly replaced by his former doubts. 

Several hours passed, during which he 
had lunch, before a knock again sounded. 
This time, as the door slid open. Savage 
could see a double row of crimson-uni- 
formed men, the personal guard of the High 
Commissioner himself. The guards stiffened 
to attention as the Commissioner appeared, 
followed by a group of high ranking officers. 

Now what, Savage wondered as he ram- 
rodded his spine and saluted. 

The group stopped in front of Savage 
and the Commissioner didn’t bother to con- 
ceal his distaste as he announced without 
preamble, "His Supreme Mightiness, Em- 
peror Hlar, Ruler of the Universe, has seen 
fit to bestow upon you. Fleet Captain Jarlon 
Choon, the Order of Trygon.” 

At the mention of the decoration an offi- 
cer stepped forward with a flat, gold case. 
Opening it, he took from it a heavy golden 
chain, from which depended a jewel en- 
crusted medallion. This he hung about 
Savage’s neck. Then he stepped back into 
position and the Commissioner went on; 

"I am further instructed to inform you 
that you have been promoted to the rank 
of Commodore. Commodore Loong here 
will give you further orders.” 

Savage’s senses reeled from this succession 
of shocks as the Commissioner turned and 
strode out with his retinue, leaving only the 
officer who had presented the decoration. 

Loong waited until the door was com- 
pletely closed and then he laughed 
uproariously. Savage could only look at him 
with amazement until he finally stopped and 
said, "Did you see the look on his face? I 
think he would almost rather have marooned 
himself on an asteroid.”

"I don’t understand,” Savage said. 

"To tell you the truth, I don’t either,” 
Loong replied. "Have you ever been to 
Court?” 

“I was born in Space,” said Savage. 

"That checks and that's what puzzles me. 
I have been reliably informed that it was 
the Empress’ agents who caused the altera- 
tion of your records. In addition to that. 
Palace gossip has it that she persuaded the 
Emperor to honor and promote you. The 
Emperor was against it. You saw for your- 
self how the High Commissioner felt. 
What’s the explanation?” 

"I have none,” Savage replied stiffly. 

Loong glanced at him sharply and said, 
"In addition the Empress expects you at the 
Palace this evening. Full dress uniform is 
required, of course. I think you should also 
wear this.” He produced a small, bolstered 
needle gun. "It’s not as messy as a blaster, 
but just as effective at close range. Above 
all, be careful. You have very few friends.” 

S AVAGE took the gun. and went to his 
room to change. Things were moving 
a little too swiftly. Why was the Empress 
so interested in him? There were a lot of 
unanswered questions and no immediate 
way to get the answers. He dressed quickly, 
strapped the needle gun to his left wrist, 
and returned to the living room. 

"How do you fit in?” he asked Loong 
bluntly. 

"As an officer in the Space Fleet I am 
under the orders of the Emperor, the Em- 
press and the High Commissioner,” he 
answered evasively. "I have arranged for a 
car. The driver has his instructions.” 

"You are not coming?” Savage asked. 
"No, but I’ll be here when you return. In 
the meantime I’ve ordered supper.” 

The brilliantly lighted Palace was 
thronged with splendid uniforms and lavish 
gowns and the main hall was a babble of 
sound. It stilled abruptly when the name 
of Commodore Choon was announced. All 
eyes were on him as a servant guided him 
across the floor; the women gazing at him 
with frank speculation and the assembled 
officers and rtatesmen with envy or thinly 
veiled hatred. Loong was right, he had few 
friends. 

He was led up the long, curving flight

RADIANT VITALITY for Every Man and Every Woman! 


Haven’t you often sighbd and said : “ Ah, ip only I could have MY TIME OVER AGAIN ? ” 

You CAN have you* time o\tr again — Science has proved it. 

Haven’t you often wished you could really LIVE ? With the boundless energy to enjoy life to the pull, to be 

FILLED WITH HAPPINESS EV'ERY MOMENT FOR THE SHEER JOY OP LIVING ? THERE IS ECSTASY INDEED ! AND IT DOtS EXIST— IT 
does EXIST TO-DAY AS THE RARE PREROCATHT OP THOSE FORTUNATE FEW (PERHAPS ONE IN TEN THOUSAND) WHO ENJOY BEAL, 
POSITIVE, PERFECT HEALTH- 

YOU, TOO, CAN HAVE RADIANT VITALmf AND ENDLESS ENERGY — SCIENCE HAS SHOWN THE W.\V — THE NEW TRIED, TESTED, 
PROVEN WAY, THAT DOES NOT FAIL. 


Glands Control 
Your Destiny ! 

From the moment you 
were bom until the moment 
you die, e\'cry bodily activity 
u controlled by your ENDO- 
CRINE or DUCTLESS 
GLANDS. Each evolves its 
special potent substances, the 
HORMONES— and their pre- 
sence in, or absence from, your 
blood, determines what you are 
or WYUit you become. Your 
height, your build, whether you 
are fat or lean, active or inactive, 
energetic or weak, clever or dull 
— your physical and mental life 
is wholly determined by your 
GLANDUL.^R activity. 

Perfect) Positive 

Health ! 



It is a Ismentabie fact, but 
cooe the le^ xrac, that the vast 
maiortty o( people living to-day 
do i>ot know what health is, 
becau-^ they have oe^'cr been 
healthy. Many of them imagine 
that they are healthy as long as 
they have no definite disease or 
illness. This is far from being 
the case I That is merely Nega- 
tive Health. No one co^d ever 
confuse it with Positive Health 
wlio has once experienced the latter ! Positive Health is not 
merely the absence of illness or disease, and those processes 
that wear out and destroy the bodily tissues ; it is the 
active presence of a lOO per cent, efficient endocrine co- 
ordination, which daily reiuvenates and renews the tissues. 
It fills the body at all times with a boundless reserve of 
energy that makes itself known by a delightful feeling of 
slight tension — a feeling of being ” wound-up,” instantly 
ready to go anywhere and tackle anything I Tms sensation 
of exhilarating vitality indicates die presence of untiring 
strength and radiant health which will outlast the passage 
of the years. People who have this Positive Health do not 
age as others do, but seem to remain perpetually young and 
vital. They arc, by the accident of chance, the lucky 
possessors of perfect endocrine co-ordination. Now this 
glorious health and t^piness can be YOURS ! 

GLANDULAR T^reatment automatically normalises 
endocrine function, eliminates endocrine imbalance and 
secures perfect endocrine co-ordination ! That means lOO 
per cent. Perfect Positive Health for YOU !

SPOILERS OF THE SPACEWAYS 


of stairs and the babble burst out anew be- 
hind him. At the end of a long hall they 
stopped before a plain door and the servant 
rapped lightly. Without waiting for an an- 
swer he opened the door and motioned 
Savage inside. 

The Empress was regally beautiful, tall 
and slim in a sweeping, brilliantly hued 
gown. Although she was more than twice 
Savage’s age neither her face or figure 
showed .'t. She extended her hand as Savage 
crossed the room and knelt before her. He 
kissed her hand and she said: 

“Rise, Commodore Choon, son of Ad- 
miral Choon. Come, sit beside me." 

“Thank you,” said Savage. 

“A long time ago I knew your father very- 
well,” she said. She smiled reminiscently 
and murmured, “Very well. And we too 
shall know each other well. You are fully as 
handsome as he was.” And so, one question 
was answered. 

He remained with her a long time, and 
when he retraced his steps to the main 
hall he found it more crowded than be- 
fore. Again all conversation ceased as he 
entered the main hall and he could feel 
countless hostile eyes on him. He felt de- 
cidedly uncomfortable as he crossed the 
seemingly endless room and he felt him- 
self walking too stiffly. He tried to relax, 
but instead he found himself pressing the 
needle gun against his side to make sure it 
was still there. 

Finally he reached the great double doors 
and he heard speculative murmurs behind 
him as the footmen opened them. This was 
the heart of a powerful interplanetary em- 
pire and yet it was no different than the 
courts of Europe during the heyday of the 
ancient kings. 

His chauffeured car waited outside the 
Palace and in a moment he was speeding 
down the winding roadway through barely 
visible gardens and groves. Then they passed 
the gates to the public highway. As they 
slowed and turned the corner there came 
the flare of heat guns. 

The glassite windows on the attacked side 
turned a rosy pink and then went black. The 
interior of the car became insufferably hot. 
The chauffeur cursed and trod heavily on the 
accelerator and the car shot forward. Flame 
licked at them until they were out of range. 


The driver mopped his brow as he said, 
"It’s a good thing she’s got full armor. Even 
so, I thought we’d had it.” 

“Yes,” snapped Savage. 

They roared through the now almost de- 
serted streets without further incident. On 
his guard now, Savage had the little needle 
gun in his hand when they stopped in front 
of the hotel. The doorman stepped forward 
and pulled open the door. He looked into 
the car and his hand flashed into his uni- 
form. Savage fired. 

The gun made no sound, but the door- 
man gave a choking gasp and fell into the 
car. 

"Quick, sir, pull him all the way in," 
Savage heard ^e chauffeur whisper. “There 
were no witnesses. I’ll take care of him.” 

Without stopping to think Savage fol- 
lowed the chauffeur's advice and dragged 
the heavy- weight into the car while the 
chauffeur alighted and came around to help 
him. Finally they closed the door on the 
body and, still without witnesses, the chauf- 
feur drove it away. 

In his suite. Savage found Loong waiting. 

“Good morning,” Loong smiled. “How 
did everything go?” 

“Just fine,” Savage replied. “Not only 
do I have no friends, I have some active 
enemies.” 

“You were attacked?” Loong asked 
calmly. 

“Twice,” Savage said. “You don’t seem 
very surprised.” 

"I rather expected it, but you seem to 
have survived. What happened?” 

Savage told him in a few brief sentences 
and when he was finished Loong said : 

“This is better than I had hoped.” 

“Better than you’d hoped,” Savage ex- 
claimed. “What am I, a target for your 
friends to shot at?” 

“They are no friends of mine,” Loong 
answered. “You’ve been in Space for a long 
time. I’d better fill you in on recent history 
right now.” 

Ill 

I T WAS at that point that Savage was 
shocked to find that the anger seething 
inside him was not that of Terran toward 
Trygonian, but of one Trygonian toward an- 


PLANET STORIES ' 


58 

other, or one Terran toward another. He 
found too that, in spite of the uncertainty 
he felt about I^ong, he was actually begin- 
ning to like him. He wondered then if 
Doctor Phillip’s tests were accurate. 

"That’s better,” Loong smiled when 
Savage sat down. "Here, have a drink and 
I'll tell you what I think the shooting is 
about.” 

Savage took the proffered glass and waited 
expectantly. 

"As you know,” Loong began, "Kalnor 
was Emperor until Hlar, then High Com- 
missioner, staged a coup d’etat. Kalnor and 
his family were murdered and Hlar pro- 
claimed himself Emperor. Czako, our pres- 
ent High Commissioner, was Captain of 
the household Guard and was elevated to 
his present lofty position as a reward for 
his part in the conspiracy. 

"During the years you have been in space 
our esteemed High Commissioner has se- 
cretly been laying the groundwork for a 
coup of his own. "rhe situation is really quite 
simple; the Emperor wants to remain Em- 
peror, while Czako wants to become Em- 
peror. Fortunately, at the moment neither 
seems powerful enough to dispose of the 
other. 

"Now consider the situation as it ap- 
plies to you. A formerly unknown and un- 
noticed Fleet captain has suddenly been 
decorated and promoted on the orders of 
Hlar himself, and this after records con- 
cerning nim were altered. He has been in- 
vited to the private chambers of the Em- 
press, where few men are invited. The High 
Commissioner fears the Emperor and Hlar is 
jealous of his wife. So . . .” 

Loong spread his hands expressively to 
finish the sentence, but Savage needed no 
more. 

"That’s clear enough,” he said, "but how 
do you fit in?” 

“I am the faithful servant of the Em- 
peror and his representative, the High Com- 
missioner.” 

"You said that before,” Savage said. 

Loong just spread his hands again. Then 
he asked abruptly: 

"What do you think of our planetary 
policies?” 

The question took Savage aback. "What 
do you mean?” he stalled. 


"I mean our policy of immediate conquest 
and subjugation of any inhabited planet we 
discover,” Loong replied. 

"That depends,” said Savage carefully. He 
drank slowly, watching Loong over the edge 
of the glass. 

"On what I think?” smiled Loong. "I 
know what I think. I want your opinion.” 

Savage decided to take a chance. "I be- 
lieve a friendly, diplomatic approach would 
be a far better method,” he said. "For ex- 
ample, in the case of Terra ...” 

"Exactly,” Loong interrupted heatedly. 
"Nothing permanent is gained by force. A 
conquered people will not remain so for- 
ever.” 

Savage’s glass suddenly slipped from 
his hand. As though from a great distance 
he watched the liquid splash on the rug 
and then the room seemed to be receding 
in the distance. He tried to rise, urgently 
aware of his dangers, but instead he felt 
himself collapse. Then all sensation ceased. 

He had no idea how much later it was 
when he awakened in his own bedroom. 
Other than a slight headache he felt no 
effects of the drug. He saw that the Trygo- 
nian day had come again, but that meant 
nothing; he could have been unconscious for 
several days. Then he rolled over and found 
that Loong was sitting beside the bed. 

"I’m sorry I had to do that,” Loong said 
calmly, "but I had to be sure.” 

"Sure of what?” Savage said, checking an 
impulse to say more violent things. 

"Your sympathies.” 

"And?” 

Loong reached inside his tunic and 
brought out a needle gun. "Your scientists 
did an excellent piece of work.” 

"What do you mean?” Savage asked, and 
at the same time knew there was no escape. 

"I mean that you are a Terran. You be- 
trayed yourself under hypnosis.” 

Savage knew the bitter feeling of utter 
defeat. He had accomplished nothing and 
now this was tlie end. But Loong wasn’t 
wearing the look of triumph that was to 
have been expected. Instead he was smil- 
ing and he put the gun away as he said: 

"I should hate to see you executed. I 
wasn’t just talking last night when I dis- 
agreed with our policies. I think a friendly 
and mutually beneficial relationship can and 


59 


SPOILERS OF THE SPACEWAYS 


should be established between our planets.” 

"That’s fine,” said Savage, "but what can 
you do about it?” 

"That remains to be seen,” answered 
Loong. "I propose that we join forces. The 
fact drat you have been able to come this 
far makes you a worthy ally. And without 
me you can do nothing. Is it agreed?” 
"Yes,” said Savage. 

"Excellent. I have several matters to at- 
tend to, but I will return at six. As a re- 
cently returned space officer it will be ex- 
pected that you enter social life to a certain 
extent and I think it best that you begin to- 
night. 

A fter Loong had gone Savage cursed 
himself for a fool, yet he thanked the 
gods that he was still alive. Something could 
still be made of this. A vague, uncrystallized 
thought was gnawing at his mind. He 
jumped out of bed and dressed quickly. He 
was not surprised to find that Loong had 
left him the needle gun. Without bothering 
with food he went to the State Library. 

His rank carried him into the innermost 
recesses of the great library, to the guarded 
tape banks where the most accurate informa- 
tion was to be found. After a quick search 
of the index he selected two tapes and tlien 
took one of the many unoccupied reading 
booths. 

He slipped the first tape, an ancient his- 
tory of Trygon II to fill the blanks in 
Choon’s education, into the projector, and 
all thought of time left him as he slumped 
down in the so^ chair before the screen. 
It wasn’t long before he realized that a rough 
parallel could be drawn between tlie early 
histories of Trygon and Terra. 

There had been wars and famines and 
great empires, but Trygon had progressed 
more rapidly, w’ithout the great recessions 
Terra had known. Three-quarters of a cen- 
tury before the beginning of Atomics on 
Terra, Trygonian scientists had already har- 
nessed solar energy. At that point the 
parallel ended. 

It wa., already late when he turned to the 
history of the Kalnor family. He found that 
they had ruled for almost a century — first 
Czur, then Trygon II and finally the System 
and the Empire. There had been periods 
when usurpers had gained control, but al- 


ways the Kalnors had returned, until finally 
Kiar, determined to put an end to the 
family, had destroyed them. ’The tape hinted 
vaguely that there had been a survivor and 
then immediately discredited the thought. 

Then the tape came to an end and Savage 
put tliem both away. Things were somewhat 
cleared now. 

Loong, in a full dress uniform hung 
heavily with decorations, was again wait- 
ing when Savage returned to the hotel. 

"What were you doing at the State Li- 
brary\^” Loong asked after they had ex- 
changed guardedly friendly salutations. 

"Doing a little checking,” Savage said 
calmly. "I have a theory that I’m working 
on. By tlie way, I haven’t eaten all day. 
Will you order something for me while 
1 change?” 

"I have already done so. You’ll find a 
fresh full dress in the bedroom. You can 
tell me about your theory when you’re 
finished.” 

Savage w'cnt to the bedroom and found 
beside the fresh uniform a belted holster 
containing a larger version of the needle gun 
he still wore. As he hefted it the reason 
for his presence on Trygon II came to him 
again, and he thought about Loong. 

By training and instinct he should have 
hated him and all Trygonians for what they 
had done to his people, but he found it a 
hard struggle to achieve that feeling. He 
liked and somehow trusted Loong and at 
the same time he still wanted freedom for 
Terra. Still pondering the problem he 
dressed quickly, not neglecting to buckle 
on the gun, and returned to the living room. 

A food laden table awaited him. Loong 
poured drinks as he entered and gave him 
one. 

"What is your theory?” Loong asked. 

"It’s not definite yet. I’ll tell you when 
it is.” 

"Veiy well,” replied Loong. "I want to 
apologize again for last night.” 

“I’d have done the same thing,” Savage 
said. 

'They ate quickly and in silence. When 
they were through, Loong declared: 

"You’re in for a treat tonight. I have 
reservations at the Club Galaxy.” 

"Oh?” said Savage with polite interest. 
He had seen or heard the name somewhere. 


PLANET STORIES 


60 

but it meant nothing to him. 

“We’ll have to hurry or we’ll miss the 
first show,” Loong said, and pushed back his 
chair. “I have a car waiting outside.” 
“Armored?” Savage ask^. 

“Completely.” 

T he existence of the Club Galaxy was 
discreetly proclaimed by a small, lighted 
sign and inside the theme of smallness was 
continued. Packed into its narrow confines 
was the highest strata of Trygonian society, 
uniforms predominating. They were guided 
to a microscopic ringside table just as the 
already dim lights dimmed still further. 

From somewhere came soft, gentle music 
and a spotlight went on to reveal a male trio. 
They sang a song, barely heard over the 
buzz of conversation, and then bowed them- 
selves out to the accompaniment of a light 
spattering of applause. Then the lights faded 
out completely and the spotlight cut off. All 
conversation ceased and an air of expectancy 
filled the room. 

With an unexpectedness that made Savage 
catch his breath, the music crashed out in a 
wild, driving rhythm. The spotlight cut sud- 
denly through the dark and caught a whirl- 
ing figure in the center of the floor. The 
audience gave a gasp of appreciation in 
which Savage shared. 

The dancer spun on her toes, a tall, long- 
legged girl in the briefest of costumes, her 
long hair flashing in a golden circle. She 
broke the spin abruptly and danced with 
flashing feet and writhing body to the wild 
rhythms. She moved with the precision of 
a fine machine, yet with the graceful beauty 
of a wild cat. 

She gave a magnificent performance and 
when the spotlight suddenly cut out, her 
audience shouted its approval. But when the 
lights went on again she had disappeared 
and, in spite of the ovation, she did not 
return to the floor. 

“She never takes a bow,” Loong ex- 
plained, “but you will meet her shortly.” 

A waiter suddenly loomed large over 
them and Loong spoke to him briefly and he 
went away again. They made small talk and 
presently the waiter returned, bearing three 
glasses and a decanter of purple liquor. 
Savage questioned the third glass with the 
raise of an eyebrow. 


“Laharna is to join us,” Loong explained. 
“It is a great honor to be favored with her 
presence at one’s table.” 

Almost as if summoned by Loong’s words 
she appeared on the opposite side of the 
floor. She crossed it with the same easy grace 
she had shown in her dance, her hair flowing 
gently down over her bare shoulders as she 
moved. Although she had typically Trygo- 
nian features. Savage thought her the most 
beautiful woman he had ever seen. He won- 
dered if it was Choon’s influence again. 

They stood to receive her and Savage 
found that she was as tall as he. 

“May I present Commodore Jarlon 
Choon,” Loong said and Savage bowed. 

“Delighted, Commodore. I have heard a 
great deal about you.” Her green eyes spar- 
kled at him mischievously. 

“I am honored . . .” Savage began, but a 
harsh voice behind him interrupted: 

“Choon, the Empress’ lover, is trying to 
make another conquest.” 

Savage spun around, his fists clenched, but 
Loong grabbed his arm. 

“Careful,” he whispered urgently, “that’s 
Satish, the High Commissioner’s right hand 
man.” 

Savage shrugged him off and, remember- 
ing the formula, said: 

“You have affronted my honor, sir. Who 
is your friend?” 

Attention had been drawn to them at the 
arrival of Larhana, but this exchange 
brought all eyes on them. Satish stood up, 
towering over Savage, and said thickly: 

“Captain Droga will act for me.” 

“Let it pass,” interjected Loong. “He is 
drunk.” 

“Not too drunk to teach this whelp to 
respect his superiors,” Satish bellowed. 
“Captain Droga, make the arrangements.” 

His distaste for the affair evident, Loong 
reluctantly conferred with Captain Droga, 
while the two principals stood aloofly silent. 
In the end it was decided that the duel was 
to take place immediately on the grounds of 
the Palace of the Stars. The claoice of 
weapons was Savage’s and he decided on 
needle guns. 

Satish and his two companions stamped 
out and Savage turned to Laharna, who had 
stood silently by. 

“I deeply apologize for causing you this

embarrassment,” he said. 

She looked at him soberly for a moment. 
Then she smiled and gave him her hand. 

"Until we meet again,” she said. 

"Thank you,” he said and turned away, 
reluctant to leave her. A lane opened 
through die hostile faces surrounding them. 
They walked out quickly and found their 
car waiting. 

"Now you’ve done it,” Loong said as 
they entered the car. "Satish is deadly with 
the needle gun. If you lose, the High Com- 
missioner will have my head for .being 
your second.” 

"And if I should win?” Savage asked. 

"I don’t know. We may be able to salvage 
something if I can get to the Commissioner 
first. But we’re not ready yet. The ’Agreet’ 
is just beginning her trials in the morning, 
and I’ve had word that you are to be her 
captain. We must have her if we are to do 
anything at all.” 

"And as her captain, you must have me,” 
Savage said. 

"Not exactly, but it would be a help.” 

"We’ll have to see what happens," Savage 
said and relaxed against the cushions. 

T hey raced through the crow'ded streets 
and then out of the city. A short time 
later they pulled to a stop on the dueling 
grounds and found that Satish had already 
arrived. Savage moved to open the door 
and Loong said; 

"Wait. I’m taking no chances.” 

He opened a compartment built into the 
back of the driver’s seat and took out a 
pair of heat guns. He buckled one to his 
belt and gave the other to the chauffeur with 
instructions to keep his eyes open. 

"All right,” he said, "we’re as prepared 
as we’ll ever be. I just hope you can shoot 
straight.” 

The two parties met in the middle of the 
field and a further discussion took place be- 
tween Loong and Droga. The car lights were 
to provide illumination and tlieir positions 
were established. Then the guns were ex- 
amined. Finally Satish and Savage were 
placed in position with ten yards between 
them and the guns were given them. The 
seconds backed away. 


"Under the rules you will raise your 
guns and fire one shot at the count of 
three,” Loong said loudly, "Only head shots 
are permitted. If both miss, honor is satis- 
fied, and the principals will leave the field. 
Your guns down, please, I am about to 
count.” 

Savage braced his feet and stood relaxed, 
a light, firm grip on his gun. 

"One.” 

What was the connection between Lar- 
hana and Loong, Savage wondered, and 
what was Loong’s plan? 

"Two.” 

He had to go along with Loong, he de- 
cided. His comments on the Terran situation 
presented interesting possibilities. Larhana 
was the most beautiful woman he had ever 
known. 

"Three.” 

With a swift, continuous motion Savage 
swung up the gun, centered the sights and 
pressed the stud. There was no sound, no 
sensation, and for a moment he thought 
thej- had both missed. Then Satish swayed 
and crumpled. 

Savage lowered his gun. Under the rules 
he had to remain in position until notified 
of the results. Others ran to Satish. Loong 
bent over him briefly and then shouted, 
"He’s dead.” 

Savage walked toward the huddled group 
and as he approached, Droga protested. 

'"That was not a head shot,” he said 
heatedly. "Look, it grazed the chin and en- 
tered the neck.” 

"I beg to differ,” Loong countered. 

"I insist,” argued Droga. "I demand satis- 
faction.” 

"I concur with Captain Droga,” broke in 
Satish ’s second companion. "I will act for 
him.” 

"But ...” Loong protested and Savage 
interrupted: 

"If he insists, he insists. It is his right.” 

They were quickly placed in position and 
again Loong counted. At "Three” Savage 
again swung up the needle gun and pressed 
the stud. Droga’s head- snapped back as his 
shot entered the ground almost at Savage’s 
feet. 

Savage remained in position until Loong 
summoned him. 

'"Tliere’s no doubt about it this time,”

Loong said triumphantly. “Right between 
the eyes.’’ 

“Honor is satisfied,” said Satish’s second 
companion and he turned away. He walked 
a step and spun around, a blaster in his 
hand. A blaster cut him in half. Loong’s 
chauffeur had kept his eyes open. 

Then there came a blaze of heat, this 
time from Satish’s car, and flame burned 
the grass beside them. Loong’s chauffeur 
turned his attention to the car. A stink filled 
the air. Loong worked his heat gun and 
they made their way back to their car behind 
a wall of fire. They roared away and there 
was no fire from the other car. 

"I didn’t think a heat gun was any good 
for spot shooting,” the chauffeur apolo- 
gized, “so I used a blaster.” 

“Good thing,” said Loong, "or we’d all 
been fried.” 

He opened the well stocked compartment 
and brought out a blaster. “Take this,” he 
said to Savage. “I’ll drop you at your hotel 
and then try to see the High Commissioner. 
You had better stay in your rooms until 
you hear from me.” 

Savage was breakfasting in his room the 
next morning when the communicator 
buzzed. 

"Loong here,” it announced, when Savage 
answered. "Things have come to a head. 
I couldn’t get to see the High Commissioner, 
but he has already had an interview with 
the Emperor. I can only guess what it w-as 
about, but I’m told that it was pretty 
stormy. 

“But that’s the least of it. The Commis- 
sioner has just issued secret orders for your 
arrest. Go to the roof of the hotel. One of 
my hilocars is already on its way to pick 
you up.” 

“Thanks. I’m on my w'ay,” Savage re- 
plied, and disconnected. He buckled on the 
blaster and with a needle gun in his hand 
he went to the door. The hall outside was 
empty and he ran swiftly to the service 
stairs. 

On the floor above he ran to the levitor 
bank and pressed the “up” stud. He watched 
the indicator impatiently as the levitor shot 
upward and stopped on the floor below. 
Then it resumed its upward climb and 
Savage held the needle gun ready as the 
doors slid apart to reveal a CID man with 


a blaster in his hand. 

Savage fired and leaped into the car as 
the blaster clattered to the floor. The CID 
man was still crumpling as Savage pressed 
the stud for the top floor. 

When the levitor doors again slid apart 
Savage jammed them with a blaster and 
raced up the stairs to the roof, praying that 
the hilocar would be waiting. It was there 
and it took off with savage acceleration as 
soon as he was aboard. Blaster and heat 
gun fire burned the air as they' rose and 
then it faded out of range. 

“Whew,” Savage breathed, "that was 
close.” 

"We’re not out of it yet,” the pilot re- 
plied. “There’s a CID hilocar on our tail.” 

A glance behind confirmed the pilot’s 
statement and Savage said: 

"My hand blaster won’t do any good 
against the stuff they carry. Can you get 
away from them?” 

“I’m using full power, but they’re gain- 
ing. There’s a high powered heater mounted 
behind you. I’ll bring it up.” 

A SECTION of the fuselage slid open and 
a long, turret-mounted heat gun rose 
into view. At the same time the seat back 
slid down to permit entry into the turret. 
Savage climbed in and settled himself over 
the sights. 

"All right,” he said, "cut your speed.” 
At full aperture this weapon didn’t re- 
quire supreme accuracy. Savage pressed the 
firing stud and the other hilocar was en- 
gulfed in flame and then it exploded. Sav- 
age’s pilot dived to ground level and after 
half an hour of maneuvering between, over 
and sometimes almost through hills and trees 
they were deep in the mountains south of the 
city. 

They landed in a mountain clearing. Then 
the trees in front of them slid apart and 
they rolled down into a ferro-concrete 
cavern; the Terran stronghold repeated. 
Larhana greeted him as he alighted. 
“What are you doing here?” he asked in- 
voluntarily. 

“I am wanted too,” she said. “Hurry, 
Commodore Loong is waiting for us.” 

The cavern hummed with swift, orderly 
activity Larhana led him quickly through 
it, but Savage had time to note the fighting

ships being readied and the blasters and 
heat guns being uncrated and loaded. Finally 
they entered a small room where Loong, 
alone, awaited them. 

"Quite a place you have here,” Savage 
said. 

“We've been preparing for a long time,” 
replied Loong, ‘’and now we are going to 
make use of it.” 

"How, Prince Kalnor.^” asked Savage 
quietly. His hand was on the needle gun in 
his pocket. 

“The High Commissioner has. . . . What 
did you say?” 

“Prince Kalnor, your Majesty.” 

“How did you know that?” Loong asked. 
He clutched at his blaster. But Savage 
brought out the needle gun and he stopped 
the movement. 

"It was evident from the beginning that 
you were not working with either the High 
Commissioner or the Emperor, but at the 
same time it was evident that you were 
highly placed in a third organization. Then 
you yourself mentioned the Kalnor family 
and I went to the State Library. 

“With two powerful factions competing 
for the Empire, it struck me that only the 
Kalnor name would attract enough adher- 
ents to form a third party. It wasn’t until a 
few moments ago that I realized that you 
were the Kalnor in question; that you would 
be the leader and not a follower. 

"Now that we each know who the other 
is, I'd like to know exactly what you intend 
to do about Terra after we’ve put you on 
the throne of Trygon.” 

“I meant what I said the other day,” the 
Prince exclaimed. “Terra will be free. And 
in time the friendly relationship of which 
I spoke can be established.” 

Savage realized that he could use the 
Prince to bargain with the Emperor, but 
once he had Kalnor would the Emperor 
stick to the terms of whatever bargain he 
had made? No, it was ridiculous to think 
that he would. He would have to trust the 
Prince. "That’s all right with me,” Savage 
said, and put away his gun. “I’d like to know 
what’s happened, though.” 

“An attempt was made on the Emperor’s 
life, and at the same time, the High Com- 
missioner proclaimed himself Emperor. 
Something went wrong, however, and the 


Emperor did not die. As a result we have 
what amounts to war between the two fac- 
tions, confined to the military and the city 
of Czur. The average Trygonian citizen 
won’t become involved.” 

“How about your men?” Savage asked. 

"They are adapting to conditions and at 
the same time spreading a rumor that a Kal- 
nor will come. When I give the signal they 
will drop all pretense and fight for the name 
of Kalnor. Now we must hurry to get con- 
trol of the A greet. A ship is being readied 
to take us there.” 

"All right. Let’s go,” said Savage, the 
light of battle in his eyes. 

"I’m coming too,” announced Larhana 
and they looked at her in surprise. 

“It’ll be no place for a woman,” Savage 
said. “There’ll probably be a battle.” 

Larhana’s green eyes darkened and Loong 
said, “There’s no use arguing with her. If 
she’s made up her mind to come nothing 
short of a blaster will stop her.” 

"You’re right,” Larhana said and they 
went out together. 

L OONG’S ship proved to be one of the 
latest medium fighters, crammed with 
firepower and short on passenger space. 
They found cramped space against the con- 
trol room bulkhead and blasted off. 

Minutes later they were approaching the 
great Fleet Spaceport, on which rested the 
tremendous Agreet. A minor battle was in 
progress below them for control of the port, 
but it was impossible to tell one faction from 
the other. Loong’s radio operator worked 
his instrument with swift efficiency and the 
gunners peered into their scanner plates and 
fingered their controls. 

After a suspense-filled eternity the radio- 
man said "Okay” and their ship dived 
toward the Agreet. A port opened in the 
huge hull and they floated in. 

They alighted quickly and a pneumatic 
car carried them swiftly forward to the 
bridge. 

There they were met by an officer whom 
Loong introduced as Captain Sian. 

“Everything is ready, your Highness,” 
Sian said, careful not to notice the presence 
of Larhana. “The officers faithful to either 
the High Commissioner or the Pretender 


fi4 


PLANET STORIES 


have been confined. The bare minimum for 
the operation of the ship remain.” 

"Very good,” said Loong with formal 
dignity. "Commodore Choon, will you 
kindly take command?” 

"Yes, sir. Captain Sian, you will take off 
immediately and establish an orbit at three 
diameters. All screens are to be thrown out 
as soon as we are clear and any ship that 
attempts to interfere is to be destroyed.” 

"Yes, sir,” said Sian and he went to the 
main controls. The ship vibrated strongly 
for a moment and then they felt it rise 
gathering momentum as it went. 

"We made it,” said Larhana, taking Sav- 
age’s arm. 

"Yes,” said Savage stifSy, "but we still 
have a lot to do.” 

He was very certain now that she had 
attracted all Trygonian officialdom to the 
Club Galaxy so that information could be 
gathered from licjuor-loosened lips for 
Loong, but he didn’t know how much fur- 
ther their relationship extended. 

The return of Sian recalled Savage to the 
problem at hand. 

"Good news, your Highness,” he an- 
nounced. "Our men have captured the 
Pretender and are proceeding according to 
plan.” 

"And the Commissioner,” Loong asked. 
"Where is he?” 

"He is directing the operations of his 
forces from his offices in the Supreme Head- 
quarters Building, your Highness. What are 
your orders?” 

"He must be destroyed at any cost,” 
Loong said grimly. "An assault would be 
indicated.” 

"Screens have been set up to guard the 
building,” Sian said. "The most powerful 
blaster will not penetrate them.” 

“We must use the Agreet’s Atomics 
then ...” 


"You’d destroy half the city,” Savage in- 
terrupted. "There’s been too much blood- 
shed already.” 

"What do you suggest, then?” asked 
Loong. 

"Have you any men in the building?” 
Savage asked. 

"We nave not been able to contact any,” 
Sian said. 

"Well, perhaps this will work. We will 


make a concentrated attack, using the 
Agreet’s armed scouts and your fighter. Dur- 
ing the attack I can take one of the scouts 
under the screen, land near the building, 
and force my way in.” 

"That might succeed,” agreed Loong. 
"But once inside you’d never find the Com- 
missioner. You don’t know the building. 
I’ll go with you.” 

"I couldn’t permit that, your Highness,” 
Sian objected. "Your life is too valuable to 
risk.” 

“What . . .” Loong flashed, but Savage 
interrupted. 

"He's right,” he said. "You’ll have to re- 
main on board the Agreet." 

"I will go in your stead, your Highness,” 
Sian said firmly. 

"Very well,” said Loong unhappily. 

"I will make the arrangements,” said 
Sian. "We will use number seven scout.” 

He excused himself and left the group, 
while Loong turned to Savage. 

"I am beginning to understand why we 
have not been able to completely subdue 
your people. Tell me, what is your Terran 
name?” 

Savage told him. 

“I have studied one of the Terran lan- 
guages a bit — English, I believe it is called 
— and it seems that your name is also a 
word. What does it mean?” 

"Untamed,” Savage said. 

"Aha!” said Loong. 

At this point Sian returned. 

"We will be in position to launch the 
attack shortly,” he said. "We had best make 
ready. I beg your pardon, but the lady seems 
to have disappeared.” 

"So she has,” said Loong after glancing 
around. “Well, we can’t look for her now.” 

They took another car to their scout ship 
and exchanged their uniforms for more 
efficient fighting suits; black coveralls, 
crash helmets, respirator masks and battle 
packs. 

They were each provided with a heat 
gun and a blaster, but Savage strapped the 
little needle gun to his wrist over the coverall 
sleeve. 

"For sniping,” he explained. 

Loong held out his hand. 

"Good luck,” he said, and Savage re- 
membered the General.

T he attacking fleet, the medium fighter 
and twelve scouts, roared in over the 
city and blaster fire came up to meet them. 
They passed through the wall of flame with 
the loss of only one scout and then they 
opened up with their own weapons. The 
only effect of their combined fire was to 
make the invisible force screen protecting 
their target flash and flare. 

They made a second pass. Two more 
scouts went down and Savage decided that 
they too crashed. He manipulated the con- 
trols and the scout lurched sickeningly and 
went into a steep dive. 

At the last possible moment Savage pulled 
out and, barely off the streets, roared bc- 
tw'een the buildings tow'ard Supreme Head- 
quarters. He slowed as they approached the 
building and rested one hand lightly on the 
bank of blaster studs. 

"Brace yourself, we’re going in," he said 
and slammed down on the studs. A chunk 
of w'all in front of them disintegrated and 
he decelerated savagely. They went through 
the gap at dead low speed, but still they 
crashed through two inner walls before they 
finally stopped. They were bruised and 
shaken, but otherwise unhurt. 

"Here’s w'here we get out,” Savage an- 
nounced and Larhana’s voice came from 
behind them. 

"Wait for me,” she cried and they 
whirled around. 

From somew'here she had gotten a suit 
of coveralls that w'ere almost the right size, 
as well as a helmet and mask. Two blasters 
were belted to her slim waist and the w'hole 
effect was one of efficient deadliness, spoiled 
only by the loveliness that insisted on mak- 
ing itself known through the coveralls. 

"What are you doing here?” Savage fi- 
nally got out. 

"I w'anted to help you,” she said simply. 
"What are we to do?” asked Sian. "We 
surely can’t leave her here.” 

"She’ll have to come wdth us. Let’s go,” 
Savage said, there was no time for argu- 
ment or recrimination. 

He kicked open the hatch and jumped 
dow'n to the rubble covered floor. Flames 
were already crackling behind the ship as 
5 — Planet Stories — ^July 


he helped Larhana alight, and when Sian 
had joined them he blasted their way 
through the wall into a corridor. 

With Sian in the lead they ran to the 
levitor bank. They had just reached it when 
a pair of doors slid open and black- 
uniformed men poured out, only to be cut 
down bloodily by Savage’s blaster. The 
carnage lasted only a few moments and then 
they were in the levitor. 

"Czako’s offices are on the forty-fifth 
floor,” Sian explained as he pressed the 
stud. "They will be thick with his men, of 
course.” 

Savage nodded grinfly, his weapons ready, 
and watched the moving indicator. Then, 
as the forty-third floor clicked by and they 
were bracing themselves for the rush, a 
muffled blast rocked the building. The lights 
w'ent out and they were hurled to the floor 
as the car stopped abruptly. Then they began 
to fall. 

For an agonizing moment they felt help- 
less, doomed. Then the safety brakes went 
on and the car ground to a halt. 

"What happened?” Larharu gasped. 

"The fire must have gotten to the scout’s 
fuel or blaster magazine and it blew up,” 
Savage said. "But we’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

Sian produced a hand torch while Savage 
tried to open the doors. 

"They’re jammed,” he said after a mo- 
ment’s effort. "Stand back. I’ll use a blaster.” 

The car filled with heat and smoke and 
the stink of burning metal came through 
their masks. Finally he had a man-sized 
opening and he stuck his head out cautiously. 
A blaster bolt from down the hall gashed 
the door above his head and he recoiled. 

"Burn a hole through the back while I 
keep them busy,” he ordered and he felt 
reflected heat from behind him as he filled 
the hall outside with flame. 

A few minutes later he heard Sian whis- 
per from close behind him, "Everything is 
clear on the other side and Larhana is on 
guard. As soon as I finish this we can get 
out of here.” 

Alternating his attention between the hall 
and Sian, Savage watched him set a block 
charge booby-trap with practiced efficiency. 
Then he was finished and they stepped over 
the trip-wire and out of the levitor. 


PLANET STORIES

T hey ran across the room and as they 
went through the door a blaster roared 
behind them. Sian screamed and fell, only 
his momentum carrying him around the 
angle of the door jamb. Savage whirled to 
return the fire and then the block charge 
erupted and was thrown against a desk. 

Protected by the wall Larhana w'as already 
at Sian’s side as Savage picked himself up. 
Vainly she was trying to staunch the flow 
of blood from the clean-cut stumps that 
were all that remained of Sian’s legs. 

Savage quickly took two pieces of Plasto- 
graft from his kit and with them sealed the 
stumps as Sian ground out between clenched 
teeth, "You’ve got to get Czako.” He 
struggled to get up, but fell back into La- 
harna’s arms, sweat glistening on his face. 

"We’ll take care of you first,’’ Savage 
said. 

"Get Czako,” Sian gasped. "Take the 
stairs. . . . Room five leads to ofl5ce. . . . Ar- 
mored door, use block charge. . . . Three 
blocks. . . . Hurry, hurry ...” 

His voice trailed off to nothingness and 
he died. 

Larhana’s green eyes were blazing as they 
cautiously traversed the offices. 

At the forty-fifth floor Savage tried the 
door. It opened and then the frame splin- 
tered under the impact of a heavy needle 
gun. They dropped to the floor, leaving the 
door ajar. He held his heat gun and blaster 
together and quickly shoved them tiirough 
the opening toward the unseen gun and 
pressed the studs. They roared and a scream 
answered. 

Still on the floor, he twisted his weapons 
around and batlied the hall with flame in 
the other direction. Then he scrambled to 
his feet and with her dancer’s agility 
Larhana followed him. Behind the flame of 
his weapons they ran down the scarred hall 
and found office five. 

Savage took no chances; he used the 
blaster on the door and his heat gun was 
on as they went in. The room’s furnishings 
were reduced to charred ruins, as were the 
three guards, but after the draperies and 
papers were consumed there was nothing 
leu to burn. 

"Keep your eyes on the door while I get 
the charges ready,” Savage ordered. 


He w’ent to the armorr*! door set into the 
opposite wall and carefully taped on the 
block charges. Then he set and connected 
the igniter. 

Returning to Larhana, he said, "We don’t 
have much time now. Cover me while I toss 
a couple of charges down the hall. As soon 
as they go off, run aaoss to that other office 
and get under cover.” 

Quickly he prepared two more charges, 
setting the igniters for contact. He threw 
one and it had not yet exploded when he 
threw’ the second. The roaring double blast 
shook the floor and ferro-concrete dust filled 
the hall. Behind a sheet of flame they raced 
across the hall. "Then, slieltered behind the 
wall, they waited for the next blast. 

Savage was ready to believe that some- 
thing had gone wrong with the igniter when 
the roaring thunder came. The rolling con- 
cussion lifted them and then slammed them 
with cruel violence to the floor. ’They lay 
dazed for a long moment before they were 
able to get up and return to office five. This 
time there was no interference. 

The charge had blown in the heavy door 
and crushed under it was a twisted needle 
gun and its crew. Of the five other men in 
the room, only one seemed capable of move- 
ment. He made a feeble effort to raise his 
blaster and Savage cut him down. 

They found High Commissioner Czako 
dazed and bleeding behind bis huge desk. 
Savage hauled him roughly to his feet and 
jabbed the blaster into his middle. 

"You’re finished, Czako,” he said. "Get 
on the radio and tell your men to lay down 
their .arms.” 

Czako nodded in bitter defeat. 

I T WAS three Trygonian months later 
when His Highness, Emperor Kalnor 
met .Savage and Larhana at the great space- 
port. Above them loomed the Agreet, ready 
to depart on its voyage through hyper-space 
to Terra. 

"We’ll be back someday,” Larhana prom- 
ised. 

"Yes,” agreed Savage. "I’m as much Try- 
gonian now as Terran, but we want to see 
Terra on the road to complete reconstruction 
first. A lot of prejudices will have to be 
overcome, but in time it will be done.”

A young man wrote us only last week: “ For two years I 
entered competitions without luck, but since getting Joan the 
Wad I have frequently been successful although I have not 

won a big pri2e, but I know that ', who won £^2,000 in a 

competition, has one because I gave it to him. When he won 
his £2,000, he gave me £100 for myself, so you see I have 
cause to bless * Queen Joan.* *’ 


JOAN THE WAD 

is the Lucky Cornish Piskey 
who Sees All, Hears All, Does AU. 


JOAN THE WAD Is Queen of the Lucky Cornish 
Piskeys. Thousands of persons all over the world 
claim that Joan the Wad has brought them Wonder- 
ful Luck in the way of Health, Wealth and Happiness. 

HISTORY FREE FOR A STAMP. 

If you will send me your name and address, a x'- 
stamp and a stamped addressed envelope for reply, 
1 will send you a history of the Cornish Piskey folk, 
and the marvellous miracles they accomplish. 
JOAN THE WAD is the QUEEN of the Lucky 
Cornish Piskeys, and with whom good luck and good 
health always attend. 

AS HEALER. 

One Lady writes: ** My sister suffered very badly for 
years, but smee I gave her a Joan the Wad to keep near her 
she is much easier. Do you think this is due to Joan or the 
Water from the lucky Well? ” 

AS MATCHMAKER. 

A young girl wrote and informed me that she had had 
scores of boy friends, but it was not until she had visited 
Cornwall and taken Joan back with her that she met the boy 
of her dreams, and as they got better acquainted she 
discovered he also has Joan the Wad. 

AS SPECULATOR. 

A man writes : I had some shares that for several years 
I couldn’t give away. They were i/- shares and all of a 
sudden they went up in the market to 7/9. I happened to be 
staring at Joan the Wad. Pure imagination, you may say, but 
I thought I saw her wink approvingly. I sold out, reinvested 
the money at greater profit and have prospered ever since.”
