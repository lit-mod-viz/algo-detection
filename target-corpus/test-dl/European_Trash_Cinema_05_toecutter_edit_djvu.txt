If you're at all faBlllar with SHOCK XPRIISS, you know that Lucas 
Balho is one of the nost knowledgable there is when it comes to 
EIJRO/THASH/CINEMA. So, it is with a Kreat deal of pleasure that 
Lucas makes his ETC debut with a review of an obscure Jesus 
Franco film. The current issue of SX has an interview with 
Franco that Lucas conducted back in 1986. 

UN CAPITAINE DE QUINZE ANSAIM CAPITIAN DE QUINCE ANOS 

(trnnslation:A Fifteen Year Old Capitain) 

Spain/France 1973. Cast: Karc cassot, Jose Manuel Marcos, Edmund 
Pui~don, Arnand Mestral, Doris Thomas, Howard Vernon, William 
Berf(er, Alberto Dalbes, Luis Barboo. 

REVIEWED BY LUCAS BALDO 

Pushed By curiosity, I bou^^ht this tape (released on the V.I.P. 
video label in France) to complete a "hole" in my Jesus Franco 
collection rather than by real interest. It's based on a Jules 
Vemes novel and I never could finish one, they always bored me 
to death, the plot always depended on scientific or educational 
mumbo iuabo. Being the screen's master of eroticism, sadism and 
horror, what would Franco do with this obviously kiddie matinee 
material? Well, it's a real horror... but not the one you might 
expect. Here, the horror cones from the way the film was edited: 
wrongly connected shots and abruptly chopped scenes which makes 
it look like a giant "bout-a-bout‘ (term used to define the un- . 
edited film put together in chronological order). For example, I 
the Admiral, Edmund Purdon, who probably didn't spend more than a | 
day or two on location (made up of two different harbors), goes 
from his house in the middle of the village and waves good-bye to 
his brat (the 15 year old capitain to be) down in the ship some 
two miles away. The overall budget is so low that Franco was 
forced to create some of the funniest "action" highlights I have 
ever seen: such as a storm imitated by n<imerous buckets of water 
thrown at the boat's passengers with a vague rocking of the 
( probably the only thing of value in the entire film), a 

hunting party consisting of the same repeated stolen 

taken from another film, and the final "liouquet", a pursuit on ^ Mtnuti : 
raft which its passengers are unable to navigate thus taking ten 
minutes to move a distance of one meter: a riot! 

I will avoid listing the anachronisms and the typical seventies 
look of the costumes, but believe me, they are countless. 

William Berger, who in real life is/was the guru of a hippie 
community certainly looks like one here, with his Indian scarf 
banded around his long curly blonde hair. Howard Vernon 
(curiously not listed on Spanish publicity materials) has a 
delicious time as a vicious slave merchant; his main direction 
seems to have been "Don't shave and wear the dirtiest brown suit 
you have." Purdom (who will appear the following year in 
Franco's LOS OJOS SINIESTROS DEL DOCTOR ORLOFF) gives one of his 
most wooden performances. It's said that he went to Europe only 
so he could follow his beloved Linda Cristian, however it seems 
here like he really regretted It! The principal character, Jose 
Manuel Marcos looks 20 years old yet he has the voice of a 10 




year old, and Uiat spoils any hope of his beint^ convincint? in 
this part. Also, Contrary t« the adapted novel, he dies at the 
end (typical of franco to make his own wacky interpretation...). 


So, for a kiddie film, it has plenty of action and is close in 
its look to Vernes’ style, if you ignore details and flagrant 
repeated use of anachronisms. personally, I would think that 
even a very naive kid would, after viewing this film laugh and 
say. . . "Cmon Jess, give the kids a break....

SPARE PARTS (1905?) DIRECTED BY RAIRER ERLER 
REVIEWED BY STEPHEN BXS.SKTTE 


Forget about the dismemberment horrors the box promises: aside 
ftuiD the violent (but bloodless) climax, this is antiseptic 
entertainment. Producer/writer/director Rainer Erler adapts his 
own novel to the screen in this Herman production filmed in the 
U.S.; COMA-style medical suspenser has some unsettling ideas and 
ambitious scope (from New Mexico's desert to the Big Apple), but 
its tale Is too diffuse to maintain its initial grip. A newlywed

aoBientSi but the folksy music (particularly the maudlin "Sesame 
Street"-type title song, "How Much Is Anyone Worth?") and 
occasionally clumsy dubbed dialogue are liabilities. All in all, 
though, you could do a lot worse; a well-told story with some 
facile plot twists and a satisfying little f inale. .. it 'll do in a 
pinch. I doubt the accuracy of the release year on the box; 
looks like '79-60 to me. Any Info would be appreciated, as 
usual . 


LA VAMPIRE NUE (1969) DIRECTED BY JEAN ROaiN 
REVIEWED BY MARSHALL CRIST 




The plot— or near as I 
can detemine fro* this 
french language tape- 
concerns a young nan 
•ho finds that his fat- 
her) a shady business- 
man. is involved with 
experiments designed to 
create a race of vam- 
pires (A German friend 
described them as "les- 
bian space vampires"). 
These attempts prove all too successful, as the vampires quickly 
assert their autonomy and turn or the father and his cohorts. 
Before this culminates, however, the son and his friend go on a 
series of adventures involving people in animal masks, suicide 
rituals, dancing servants and more funky lighting effects than an 
acid lashback. The film’s conclusion takes place on the same 
beach as half-a-dozen other Rollin epics and is unusually upbeat. 


Ah. the spring of 1969. 
One could forget the 
era's global turmoil 
and settle back with 
the latest installment 
of Jean Rollin’s psy- 
chedelic French lesbian 
vampire series. In 
this particular insta- 
nce it's number 2, LA 
VAMPIRE NUE, the dir- 
ector’s first color 
feature. Compared to 
his relatively impover- 
ished debut (LE VIOL DU 
VAMPIRE, 1968) Rollin 
had more financial free 
dom this time and he 
clearly decided to go 
nuts and throw out the 
conventions of narra- 
tive cohesion in favor 
of outrageous disjoint- 
ed imagery. 


Even diehard European Trash Cinewa enthusiasts are likely to 
consider LA VAMPIRE NUE an extremely dated curio. For fans of 
the more outrageous indulgences of the late 60s, however, the 
film is a maior dlscoverv. Whi le visual ly simi lar to Rollin’s 
next effort (LE FRISSONS DES VAMPIRES, 1971 ) VAMPIRE NUE is 
strikingly different in its more stylized treatment of Its plot. 
The erotic dance sequences do nothing to advance the story, but 
they along with the outlandish costumes and the anarchic 
score(remlnescent of THE EVIL DEAD) all serve to make this a 
unique movie. 


6 


Rollin fans will find VAMPIRE NUE an indispensible addition to 
their collections. The all-star cast alone is enough to assure 
some knowing chuckles; a veo' young Paul Bisciglia plays the 
suicide cult's leader, both hippie vampires from FRISSONS are 
present, and two of the Castel sisters, Pony and Cathy make their 
first Rollin appearances under the surname "Tricot". The pair 
figure into one of the film's nost enioyable scenes, which 
involves the antagonist talking on the phone while idly using one 
of the young woman's funky breast covers as a makeshift abacus! 
Also, Rollin takes care to exploit their nearly identical looks 
hy having thum walk in unison as much as possible, like macabre 
Double Mint Twins. If this doesn't sound like fun to you, or if 
you prefer Haimier's Rarnstein films to DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS and 
THE BLOOD SPATTERED BRIDE, then stay the Kell away! 

The next reviewer to debut in ETC is Max Della Mora, the editor 
of the Italian fanzine GOREZILLA. with a review of WITCHERY . 
Max is currently serving a mandatory year's service in the 
Italian Army yet he still found the time to submit a review. 
Thanks to Max I'm able to use the Italian movie ad for this film 
(LA CASA A, the first three films using the LA CASA title were 
THE EVIL DEAD, EVIL DEAD 2 and GHOSTHOUSE). 


WITCHERY (1986) VimARK VIDEO 
DIRECTED BY MARTIN NEWLIN REVIEWED BY MAX DELLA MORA 


ACCA^MO COSE TERRIBIU 



A girl Is stalked by a group of 
dark figures armed with axes and 
pitch forks. She finds refuge in 
abandoned house in the middle of 
nowhere, but not for long as they 
track her down. Chased down a 
long corridor, the young woman 
finding no escape, jumps out the 
window into black emptiness. Jane 
(Linda Blair) wakes up and re- 
al izeii she was having a night- 
mare. Jane is pregnant and her 
parenls (a mother who worse than 
a Har|>y and a peeping tom father 
who looks like a cross between 
Christopher Lee and Edmund Pur- 
dom) want to buy her a villa on 
an island where an exclusive VIP 
Club is located. With an archi- 
tect (Catherine Hlckland of CAPI- 
TOL soap-opera fame) and a real 
estate agent aboard the Foxy La- 
dy (a tribute to Teresa Horlos- 
ky?) they all head off to the is- 
ious "lody in black' (a grotescpje 
an omen of bad luck to < 


land. They all see a mystes 
Hiidegard Knef) and feel she 

the villa there are already an occult science student, Jul 
a photographerfOavid Hasselhoff). Julie is a virgin and David 
tries evry way he can to change that situation but she would 




rather uncover the secret around the "light of the witch" who 
soHetioes appears in the verv sasie window that the girl in Jane’s 
dreaa Juaped froa. As soon as the group arrives at the villa the 
lady in black has murdered a sailor troii the Foxy Lady and then 
begins snuffing neabers of the group as well. Blair is 
"at^urbed” by a bathpool which transport her to another diaension 
where she sees two witches eating a fetus. Linda's aoa is 
silenced forever as the witches (joined some warlocks) sew her 
aouth shut (a very effective and gory scene), then she Is stuffed 
into a chianey and is burned alive. The father is killed when 
all of his veins explode, the architect has one hand aaputated, 
garrotted and is finally pierced by the sharp end of a 
swordfish's snout. The real estate agent is crucified and burned 
on the beach. Julie gets raped by a demon (who also has his 
aouth sewn shut) in a scene reainscent of the sexual violence 
found in I SPIT ON yOUR GRAVE. The reason for all this is 
practically non-existant (a black nan who had previously 
possessed Blair, but whenV)aitd the requsite surprise endin occurs 
when Julie escapes but appears to be the new receptacle of The 
Evil One. . .heh,heh,helil 

WITCHERY was produced by Joe D'Aaato's Filnirage so perhaps 
Karlin New) in is yet another pseudonyn of the man with a thousand 
monikers. Pretty wan, with terrible photography (or was it a bad 
print?), gory effects but few in nuaber, and atrocious acting 
(Linda Blair doesn't do too auch, .just looks into space and 
probably wonders why she is here), WITCHERY offers nothing new. 
Watch it on a rainy day when nothing else is available. That's 
what 1 did. 


ISLAND WOMEN (1960) PRIVATE SCREENINGS VIDEO 
REVIEWED BY TIH LUCAS ^1989 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 
FRANCEiLE CORPS ET LE FOUET ("The Body and the Whip") 
GERMANY: GEFANGENFRAUEN ("Caged Women") 

Cast: Karine Gaabier (Coaaander). Brigitte Lahaie (Ist Blonde 
Whore), France Loaay (2nd Blonde Whore). Eric Falk (head guard), 
and Nadine Pascal (bKinette whore). 86 (U.S.80) ainutes. 

When the U.N. announces an investigation into the abduction of 
several women in an unaaed Central American country, a nervous El 
Presidente decides to relocate these white slaves *-aU auy 
de.sirable European women- iron their bordello stations to Rat 
Island's Tago Mago Prison. Three prisoners are escorted there at 
soldiers' gunpoint and thrown together in the saae cell. Lahaie 
and Pascal are sexually accosted by their guards each night, 
while Loaay (who incidentally, is NOT Lina Koaav) couples with 
Gambler, the voluptuous Coaaander of Tago Hago (also £1 
Presidetite's faithless mistress), who struts around the sunny 
premises in a wardrobe seemingly culled from leather sex shops. 
Ganbier indulges on the side in a secret affair with Falk, the 
prison's sadistic chief guard. An attempted escape by two 
prisoners results in their torture and, to discourage further 
atteapts. the other inmates are told of the shark infested waters 
encircling the island and stripped of their numbered uniforms.

+ t t + 

Sleekly filmed in modest but pictviresque settings, ISLAND WOMEN 
is fairly minor Franco, but not without humor or points of 
interest. It is useless as erotica — at least in its 
abbreviated American version — thanks to its overly mechanical 
sex scenes, which suggests the popularity of European women in 
Central America has something to do with their not requring any 
foreplay! 

The film’s prison exteriors were shot in an abandoned, peeling 
bullring (Hat Island, we're told, is so isolated even the rats 
have abandoned it!) and the gentle, uncredited flamenco score 
diiniinating the travelogue footage of the island amusingly seques 
during many "nightly visitation" sex scenes to bullfight 
fanfares. While the surge of pomposity seems comic on first 
viewing, it seems to respond on additional viewings to a 
disturbing tension that exists between its male and female 
characters that is sporting at best, mercenary at worst, but 
always using, humiliating, enslaving to both parties. 

Of the three men portrayed in ISLAND WOMEN, we see the arrogant 
Falk paintully defeated in a nude arena battle with Lomay, under 
Gambler’s unfazed expression; a Falk/Gambier tryst is cleverly 
filmed in a high-angle shot, looking through the "castrating" 
blades of a ceiling fan, as the camera tracks slowly toward a 
hung photograph of the betrayed El Presidente; when Paolo assumes 
charge at the end of the picture, he is obviously caught in 
historical cogs that will crush this new Presidente as they have 
all the others. 

Whereas the male characters make us experience the bitter taste 
of defeat (to an admittedly sketchy but nevertheless felt 
degree), the women are creatures of ambition. Franco often 
contrasts their stewing expressions with shots of the sun riding 
the ocean’s horizon; it becomes his presentation of the light at 
the end of their respective Luiuiels. Again, the information is 
barely sketched, but present. The film is too embittered by its 
theme to treat its men as less than bullying barriers or its 
women as anything more than shapely scenery. 





ting scrapbook of "perfect specinens". 


Considering her outrageous ward- 
robe, Gambier should have stolen 
the picture but her perforwance 
seems listlessly disengaged, a 
far cry from her alert work in 
Franco's SEXY SISTEBS/DIE TEUFLI- 
SCHEi^ SCHWESTERN (1976). Even 
hrigitte Laliale, so effective as 
the scythe-wielding vampire in 
Jean Rollin’s FASCINATION (1979) 
is less assertive than usual. A- 
sirte from Falk’s hearty boorish- 
ness (which reminded me of Oliver 
Reed’s performance in TOMMY, of 
all things), the film’s Best Cha- 
racter Award goes to the prison 
doctor, a Sid Vicious look-alike 
whose hobby is cutting the heads 
off clipped pom magazine photos, 
which he preserves in a tltilla- 


The Private Screenings release features no cast or credits 
information, either on the video box or the tape itself (which 
features a burned-on video title only). In keeping with the 
company’s policy of only "wholesome" softcore erotica, nearly 0 
minutes of intensive whipping scenes and penetration Inserts have 
been removed as unsuitable. Most European releases include the 
material. 


As with DIE NICTEN DER FRAU OBERST, Franco directed the film for 
German producer Erwin C. Dietrich under his Elite Film’s house 
pseudonym, "Michael Thomas." It's also worth noting that the 
liln’s French title Is identical to that of Mario Bava's LA 
FRUSTRA E IL CORPO (1963), which was shown here as WHAT I .
