Steps for converting .azw file to .epub or .pdf or .txt:

Pre-requisites for these steps:
•	Calibre downloaded on the system
•	Download the DeDRM plugin zip file
•	Kindle file in .azw format

1.	Install DeDRM plugin for Calibre:
•	Unzip the downloaded zip file for DeDRM
•	Run calibre. From the Preferences menu select “Change calibre behavior”
•	Click on Plugins (under “Advanced”) — it looks like a jigsaw puzzle piece.
•	Click on the large “Load plugin from file” button
•	Navigate to the tools folder unzipped in step 2
•	Open the “DeDRM_calibre_plugin” folder
•	Select the DeDRM_plugin.zip file in that folder
•	Click on the “Add” (sometimes “Open”) button.
•	Click on the “Yes” button in the “Are you sure?” warning dialog that appears. A “Success” dialog will appear, saying that the plug-in has been installed. Click on “OK”
2.	Now, add the book in the calibre library by clicking on the green button “Add books” at the top.
3.	Select the book and click on “Convert books” -> “Convert Individually”.
4.	A window pops up. Select the “Page Setup” from the left side-bar of the window.
5.	In that, select: “Default Output Profile” for Output Profile section and “Kindle” for Input Profile Section
6.	Again, navigate back to “Metadata” from left side-bar and select the required output format from the dropdown – epub or pdf or txt
7.	This creates the file in that particular format.
8.	When the job is done, you can select the book from the main screen and on right side-bar of its description, it will show the formats available for that particular book. 
9.	Right-click on it and download that.
