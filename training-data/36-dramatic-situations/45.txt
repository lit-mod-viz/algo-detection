NINTH SITUATION
DARING ENTERPRISE
(A Bold Leader; an Object; an Adversary)

The Conﬂict, which forms the framework of all
dramatic situations, is, in the Ninth, clearly drawn,
undisguised. A clever plan, a bold attempt, sang-‘

A—Prepmtions For Warz—(In this class, as

of enthusiastic prediction). Examplesz—Aeschylus’
“Nemea”; “The Cpuncil of the Argives” by Sophocles.
Historic examples: the call to the Crusades; the
Volunteers of ’92.

‘ B (1)—War:-—Shakespeare’s “Henry V.”

(2)—A Combat:—“Glaucus Pontius," Memnon,”
“Phineus” and “The Phorcides” of Aeschylus.

C (1)—Carrying Off a Desired Person or Object:
—the “Prometheus” of Aeschylus; the “Laconian

Homeric hymn (to Hermes).

(2)—Recapture of a Desired 0hject:——“The Victory
of Arjuna,” by Cantchana Atcharya; Wagner's “Parsi-

covery of the New World”; Aeschylus’ “Prometheus
