CONCLUSION 143

sort of mountain, ﬂooded with light and air,—-raised,
- thanks to our conquest of iron added to the construc-
tive experience of the Middle Ages; offered to the na-
tion by those who have still held to the vanity of riches,
—a greater thing than the theatre of Dionysos where
gathered thirty thousand people, greater than that of
Ephesus wherein sat, joyous, a hundred and ﬁfty
thousand spectators, an immense oriﬁce—like crater in
which the earth seems to encompass the very
heavens.
