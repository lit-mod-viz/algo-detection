TWENTY-THIRD SITUATION 81

clearly manifested in Class D (especially D 2) of Sit-
uation XXII (“Measure for Measure,” “Le Huron,”
etc.) but it is ther; presented most crudely, by a single
character or event, of a nature tyrannical and odious.
Whereas in “Melanippe” it results so logically and piti-
lessly from the action that it does not obcur to us to
rebel against it; we accept it without question, so nat-
ural does it appear, so overwhelming.

Before leaving these four symmetrical situations, I
would suggest a way of disposing their elements with a
view to seeking states of mind and soul less familiar.
We have just seen these forces marshalled:-—Passion
(vice, etc.) ; pure affection (for parents, friends, bene-
factors, and particularly devotion to their honor, their
happiness, their interests) ; reasons of state (the suc-
cess of a compatriot, of a cause, of a work); egoism
(will to live, cupidity, ambition, avarice, vanity) ;
honor (truthfulness, feminine chastity, promises to
God, ﬁlial piety). Oppose these to each other, two 53'
two, and study and the ensuing conﬂicts.

'The ﬁrst cases produced will be those already cited.
Here follow other and newer ones:—a passion or vice
destroying interests of state (for in “Antony and
Cleopatra” it is only the royal pomp of the two lovers
which is impressive; one does not reﬂect upon the
peril of their peoples); egoism (in the form of ambi-
tion, for example) struggling with faith in the soul of
man, a frequent case in religious wars; egoism in this
ambitious guise overcoming natural affection (the
plotter denying or sacriﬁcing his father,'mother or
friend offers a ﬁne study) ; a conﬂict between personal
honor and reasons of state (Judith in the arms of H010-
fernes; Bismarck falsifying the despatch of his mas-
ter). Then oppose the various nuances to each other
(the hero torn between his faith and the honor of his
