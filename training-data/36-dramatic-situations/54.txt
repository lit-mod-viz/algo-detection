THIRTEENTH' SITUAT‘ON 49

represent convincingly an element of discord powerful
enough to cause the breaking of the strongest human
ties.

A—Hatred of Brothers: (1)—0ne Brother Hated by
Several (the hatred not malignant) : “The Heliades" of
Aeschylus (motive, envy) ; “The Labors of Jacob," by
Lope de Vega (motive, ﬁlial jealousy). Hated by a
single brother: The “Phoenissae” of Euripides and of
Seneca; “Polynices” by Alﬁeri (motive, tyrannical ava-
rice); Byron’s “Cain” (motive, religious jealousy);
“Une Famille au Temps de Luther" by Delavig'ne
(motive, religious dissent); “Le Duel” (Lavedan,
1905).

(2)—Reciprocal Hatredz—The “Seven Against
Thebes,” by Aeschylus, and “Les Fréres Ennemis”
by Racine (motive, greed for power); an admirable
supplementary character is added in this Theban
legend, the Mother, torn between the sons; “Thyestes
II” of Sophocles ; “Thyestes” of Seneca; the “Pelopides”
by Voltaire; “Atreus and Thyestes" by Crébillon
(motive, greed for power, the important role being
that of the perﬁdibus instigator).

(3)—Hatred Between Relatives for Reasons of
Self-lnterest:—“La Maison d’Argile” (Fabre, 1907).
Example from ﬁction; “Mon Frére” (Mercereau).

B—Hatred of Father and Son:—(1)—0f the Son
for the Father:—“Three Punishments in‘ One," by
Calderon. Historic example: Louis XI and Charles
VII. A part of “La Terre” by Zola and of “Le Maitre”
by Jean J ullien.

(2)—Mutual Hatredz—“Life is a Dream," by
Calderon. ‘ Historic instance: Jerome and Victor
Bonaparte (a reduction of hatred to simple disagree-
ment). This nuance appears to me to be one of the
ﬁnest, although one of the least regarded by our
writers.

(3)——Hatred of Daughter for Father:—-“The Cenei,"
