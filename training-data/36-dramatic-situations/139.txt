134 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

same individual or group, or toward several; some-
times, ﬁnally, the hero plays these roles now simul-
taneously, and again successively.

But it is not possible to detail in these pages, even
if I so desired, the second part of the Art of Combina-
tion; that which we in France call by the somewhat

These and similar titles cause me not a blush.

A singular history, in truth, is that of the “Imagin-
ation.” Certainly no one in classic times thought of
'priding himself upon it. Far from it! Every novelty,

on its ﬁrst appearance, hastened to support itself by
