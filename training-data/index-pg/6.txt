It is with a czfnsidczable \degrée of pride and satisfaction that I present this
work to the literaky fraternity. For a long time I have felt that there should
be some practical and simple method designed which would not only be of
assistance to literary students in the matter of plot building. but would be
equally valuable to professional Writers as a means of enabling them to quickly
apply their creative powers; When necessary. Therefcrre, When the author and
inventor of the Geuig system submitted his idea of 3 “Plot Genie” t0 me, I
was immediately interesied.

Furthm gratiﬁcation was experienced by me When immediately after the
publication of the ﬁrst edition we began to receive enthusiastic letters of
commendation and appreciation from many noted literary authorities, and I
wish to thank them for [he very helpful and worth While suggestions Which
have: been made for the improvement of the work.

I sincerely share the opinion of other publishers Who have expressed
themselves as believing that this invention of the Plot Genie will have a
deﬁnite bearing on the character of story plots around Which much of our
future ﬁction and drama will be built, to the end that stories in general will be
improved in merit because they will be better plotted. I further feel that such
a scientiﬁc system as is applied to the building of dramatic plots with this
method is distinctly in line With the modem trend in 21! things toward
eﬂiciency and economy of effort,

Sincerely.

ERNEST E. GAGNON.
Publisher.
