rest of the procession. That is exactly What happens when we open a blind
alley in a story.

may be in the introduction of a character Who for a time occupies the center of
the stage and then drops out of the story. The reader is {ad to believe that
such a character will play an important role, only to be disappointed by his
disappearance.
