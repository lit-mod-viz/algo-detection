SAMPLE PLOTS

We art: now gaing to dial out ten 53mg}: plats oi DatectivaySa
tery starias and chaos: om: of them for further development. F0110 ’-
ing each outline, we will write a short synopsis and generalize these:
in such a way that a great deal of. latitude will be ieft m the imagin-
atioa} 0f the author.

Aithough 3: is suggesfcd in the special instmctions which precede
the list of story :Iemanm further aiong, that the autbar may deter~
mine: for himself haw many Elements he is ten use fmm certain of the
lists, we have arbitrarily decided, to use the. following furmula in
these sample plots.

The fallawifmg are the authines and the Thumbnail Synapsis which
has baqn dcvcidped from each. I wgmt to emphasize the fact thabit
is very important, as 30011 as the author has obtained the deaired
outline, that he proceed to write, tha Thumbnail Synopsis as I. have
done hare. He will ﬁnd that this WEI} assist materially in the ﬁrst step
taward cementing tsgcther the variaus star}? elements which in the
outline: irscif may appear at ﬁrst glancc to be contradictury, or to
have no passible relationship. As soon as this Thumbnail Synopsis
hay been written, he may then discard the: outline aitogether before
proccmding furthczr.
