# Plot Genie Training and Detection

In this project we have used a dataset extracted from the Plot Genie and Plotto books to train a machine
capable of detecting the traces of historial algorithm composition.

Our training corpus included:

- Ten Million Photoplay Plots (1919) by Wycliffe Hill 
- The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1924) by Georges Polti
- Plotto (1928) by William Wallace Cook
- Plot Genie Index: General Formula (1931) by Wycliffe Hill

- Plot Genie: Action-Adventure (1931)
- Plot Genie: Detective-Mystery (1933)
- Plot Genie: Short-Short Story (1934)
- Plot Genie: Detective-Mystery (1936)
