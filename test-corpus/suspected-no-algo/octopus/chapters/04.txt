On the Quien Sabe ranch, in one of its western divisions, near the line
fence that divided it from the Osterman holding, Vanamee was harnessing
the horses to the plough to which he had been assigned two days before,
a stable-boy from the division barn helping him.

Promptly discharged from the employ of the sheep-raisers after the
lamentable accident near the Long Trestle, Vanamee had presented himself
to Harran, asking for employment. The season was beginning; on all
the ranches work was being resumed. The rain had put the ground into
admirable condition for ploughing, and Annixter, Broderson, and Osterman
all had their gangs at work. Thus, Vanamee was vastly surprised to find
Los Muertos idle, the horses still in the barns, the men gathering in
the shade of the bunk-house and eating-house, smoking, dozing, or going
aimlessly about, their arms dangling. The ploughs for which Magnus and
Harran were waiting in a fury of impatience had not yet arrived, and
since the management of Los Muertos had counted upon having these in
hand long before this time, no provision had been made for keeping the
old stock in repair; many of these old ploughs were useless, broken, and
out of order; some had been sold. It could not be said definitely
when the new ploughs would arrive. Harran had decided to wait one week
longer, and then, in case of their non-appearance, to buy a consignment
of the old style of plough from the dealers in Bonneville. He could
afford to lose the money better than he could afford to lose the season.

Failing of work on Los Muertos, Vanamee had gone to Quien Sabe.
Annixter, whom he had spoken to first, had sent him across the ranch
to one of his division superintendents, and this latter, after
assuring himself of Vanamee's familiarity with horses and his previous
experience--even though somewhat remote--on Los Muertos, had taken him
on as a driver of one of the gang ploughs, then at work on his division.

The evening before, when the foreman had blown his whistle at six
o'clock, the long line of ploughs had halted upon the instant, and the
drivers, unharnessing their teams, had taken them back to the division
barns--leaving the ploughs as they were in the furrows. But an hour
after daylight the next morning the work was resumed. After breakfast,
Vanamee, riding one horse and leading the others, had returned to
the line of ploughs together with the other drivers. Now he was busy
harnessing the team. At the division blacksmith shop--temporarily put
up--he had been obliged to wait while one of his lead horses was shod,
and he had thus been delayed quite five minutes. Nearly all the other
teams were harnessed, the drivers on their seats, waiting for the
foreman's signal.

“All ready here?” inquired the foreman, driving up to Vanamee's team in
his buggy.

“All ready, sir,” answered Vanamee, buckling the last strap.

He climbed to his seat, shaking out the reins, and turning about, looked
back along the line, then all around him at the landscape inundated with
the brilliant glow of the early morning.

The day was fine. Since the first rain of the season, there had been no
other. Now the sky was without a cloud, pale blue, delicate, luminous,
scintillating with morning. The great brown earth turned a huge flank to
it, exhaling the moisture of the early dew. The atmosphere, washed clean
of dust and mist, was translucent as crystal. Far off to the east, the
hills on the other side of Broderson Creek stood out against the pallid
saffron of the horizon as flat and as sharply outlined as if pasted on
the sky. The campanile of the ancient Mission of San Juan seemed as fine
as frost work. All about between the horizons, the carpet of the land
unrolled itself to infinity. But now it was no longer parched with heat,
cracked and warped by a merciless sun, powdered with dust. The rain had
done its work; not a clod that was not swollen with fertility, not a
fissure that did not exhale the sense of fecundity. One could not take
a dozen steps upon the ranches without the brusque sensation that
underfoot the land was alive; roused at last from its sleep, palpitating
with the desire of reproduction. Deep down there in the recesses of
the soil, the great heart throbbed once more, thrilling with passion,
vibrating with desire, offering itself to the caress of the plough,
insistent, eager, imperious. Dimly one felt the deep-seated trouble of
the earth, the uneasy agitation of its members, the hidden tumult of
its womb, demanding to be made fruitful, to reproduce, to disengage the
eternal renascent germ of Life that stirred and struggled in its loins.

The ploughs, thirty-five in number, each drawn by its team of ten,
stretched in an interminable line, nearly a quarter of a mile in length,
behind and ahead of Vanamee. They were arranged, as it were, en echelon,
not in file--not one directly behind the other, but each succeeding
plough its own width farther in the field than the one in front of it.
Each of these ploughs held five shears, so that when the entire company
was in motion, one hundred and seventy-five furrows were made at the
same instant. At a distance, the ploughs resembled a great column of
field artillery. Each driver was in his place, his glance alternating
between his horses and the foreman nearest at hand. Other foremen, in
their buggies or buckboards, were at intervals along the line, like
battery lieutenants. Annixter himself, on horseback, in boots and
campaign hat, a cigar in his teeth, overlooked the scene.

The division superintendent, on the opposite side of the line, galloped
past to a position at the head. For a long moment there was a silence. A
sense of preparedness ran from end to end of the column. All things were
ready, each man in his place. The day's work was about to begin.

Suddenly, from a distance at the head of the line came the shrill
trilling of a whistle. At once the foreman nearest Vanamee repeated it,
at the same time turning down the line, and waving one arm. The signal
was repeated, whistle answering whistle, till the sounds lost themselves
in the distance. At once the line of ploughs lost its immobility, moving
forward, getting slowly under way, the horses straining in the traces. A
prolonged movement rippled from team to team, disengaging in its passage
a multitude of sounds---the click of buckles, the creak of straining
leather, the subdued clash of machinery, the cracking of whips, the deep
breathing of nearly four hundred horses, the abrupt commands and cries
of the drivers, and, last of all, the prolonged, soothing murmur of
the thick brown earth turning steadily from the multitude of advancing
shears.

The ploughing thus commenced, continued. The sun rose higher. Steadily
the hundred iron hands kneaded and furrowed and stroked the brown, humid
earth, the hundred iron teeth bit deep into the Titan's flesh. Perched
on his seat, the moist living reins slipping and tugging in his hands,
Vanamee, in the midst of this steady confusion of constantly varying
sensation, sight interrupted by sound, sound mingling with sight, on
this swaying, vibrating seat, quivering with the prolonged thrill of the
earth, lapsed to a sort of pleasing numbness, in a sense, hypnotised by
the weaving maze of things in which he found himself involved. To keep
his team at an even, regular gait, maintaining the precise interval,
to run his furrows as closely as possible to those already made by the
plough in front--this for the moment was the entire sum of his duties.
But while one part of his brain, alert and watchful, took cognisance of
these matters, all the greater part was lulled and stupefied with the
long monotony of the affair.

The ploughing, now in full swing, enveloped him in a vague, slow-moving
whirl of things. Underneath him was the jarring, jolting, trembling
machine; not a clod was turned, not an obstacle encountered, that he did
not receive the swift impression of it through all his body, the very
friction of the damp soil, sliding incessantly from the shiny surface of
the shears, seemed to reproduce itself in his finger-tips and along the
back of his head. He heard the horse-hoofs by the myriads crushing down
easily, deeply, into the loam, the prolonged clinking of trace-chains,
the working of the smooth brown flanks in the harness, the clatter of
wooden hames, the champing of bits, the click of iron shoes against
pebbles, the brittle stubble of the surface ground crackling and
snapping as the furrows turned, the sonorous, steady breaths wrenched
from the deep, labouring chests, strap-bound, shining with sweat,
and all along the line the voices of the men talking to the horses.
Everywhere there were visions of glossy brown backs, straining, heaving,
swollen with muscle; harness streaked with specks of froth, broad,
cup-shaped hoofs, heavy with brown loam, men's faces red with tan, blue
overalls spotted with axle-grease; muscled hands, the knuckles whitened
in their grip on the reins, and through it all the ammoniacal smell of
the horses, the bitter reek of perspiration of beasts and men, the
aroma of warm leather, the scent of dead stubble--and stronger and more
penetrating than everything else, the heavy, enervating odour of the
upturned, living earth.

At intervals, from the tops of one of the rare, low swells of the land,
Vanamee overlooked a wider horizon. On the other divisions of Quien Sabe
the same work was in progress. Occasionally he could see another column
of ploughs in the adjoining division--sometimes so close at hand that
the subdued murmur of its movements reached his ear; sometimes so
distant that it resolved itself into a long, brown streak upon the
grey of the ground. Farther off to the west on the Osterman ranch other
columns came and went, and, once, from the crest of the highest swell on
his division, Vanamee caught a distant glimpse of the Broderson ranch.
There, too, moving specks indicated that the ploughing was under way.
And farther away still, far off there beyond the fine line of the
horizons, over the curve of the globe, the shoulder of the earth, he
knew were other ranches, and beyond these others, and beyond these still
others, the immensities multiplying to infinity.

Everywhere throughout the great San Joaquin, unseen and unheard, a
thousand ploughs up-stirred the land, tens of thousands of shears
clutched deep into the warm, moist soil.

It was the long stroking caress, vigorous, male, powerful, for which the
Earth seemed panting. The heroic embrace of a multitude of iron hands,
gripping deep into the brown, warm flesh of the land that quivered
responsive and passionate under this rude advance, so robust as to be
almost an assault, so violent as to be veritably brutal. There, under
the sun and under the speckless sheen of the sky, the wooing of
the Titan began, the vast primal passion, the two world-forces, the
elemental Male and Female, locked in a colossal embrace, at grapples in
the throes of an infinite desire, at once terrible and divine, knowing
no law, untamed, savage, natural, sublime.

From time to time the gang in which Vanamee worked halted on the signal
from foreman or overseer. The horses came to a standstill, the vague
clamour of the work lapsed away. Then the minutes passed. The whole work
hung suspended. All up and down the line one demanded what had happened.
The division superintendent galloped past, perplexed and anxious. For
the moment, one of the ploughs was out of order, a bolt had slipped,
a lever refused to work, or a machine had become immobilised in heavy
ground, or a horse had lamed himself. Once, even, toward noon, an entire
plough was taken out of the line, so out of gear that a messenger had to
be sent to the division forge to summon the machinist.

Annixter had disappeared. He had ridden farther on to the other
divisions of his ranch, to watch the work in progress there. At twelve
o'clock, according to his orders, all the division superintendents put
themselves in communication with him by means of the telephone wires
that connected each of the division houses, reporting the condition
of the work, the number of acres covered, the prospects of each plough
traversing its daily average of twenty miles.

At half-past twelve, Vanamee and the rest of the drivers ate their
lunch in the field, the tin buckets having been distributed to them that
morning after breakfast. But in the evening, the routine of the previous
day was repeated, and Vanamee, unharnessing his team, riding one horse
and leading the others, returned to the division barns and bunk-house.

It was between six and seven o'clock. The half hundred men of the gang
threw themselves upon the supper the Chinese cooks had set out in the
shed of the eating-house, long as a bowling alley, unpainted, crude, the
seats benches, the table covered with oil cloth. Overhead a half-dozen
kerosene lamps flared and smoked.

The table was taken as if by assault; the clatter of iron knives upon
the tin plates was as the reverberation of hail upon a metal roof. The
ploughmen rinsed their throats with great draughts of wine, and, their
elbows wide, their foreheads flushed, resumed the attack upon the beef
and bread, eating as though they would never have enough. All up and
down the long table, where the kerosene lamps reflected themselves deep
in the oil-cloth cover, one heard the incessant sounds of mastication,
and saw the uninterrupted movement of great jaws. At every moment one
or another of the men demanded a fresh portion of beef, another pint of
wine, another half-loaf of bread. For upwards of an hour the gang ate.
It was no longer a supper. It was a veritable barbecue, a crude and
primitive feasting, barbaric, homeric.

But in all this scene Vanamee saw nothing repulsive. Presley would
have abhorred it--this feeding of the People, this gorging of the human
animal, eager for its meat. Vanamee, simple, uncomplicated, living so
close to nature and the rudimentary life, understood its significance.
He knew very well that within a short half-hour after this meal the
men would throw themselves down in their bunks to sleep without moving,
inert and stupefied with fatigue, till the morning. Work, food, and
sleep, all life reduced to its bare essentials, uncomplex, honest,
healthy. They were strong, these men, with the strength of the soil they
worked, in touch with the essential things, back again to the starting
point of civilisation, coarse, vital, real, and sane.

For a brief moment immediately after the meal, pipes were lit, and
the air grew thick with fragrant tobacco smoke. On a corner of the
dining-room table, a game of poker was begun. One of the drivers, a
Swede, produced an accordion; a group on the steps of the bunk-house
listened, with alternate gravity and shouts of laughter, to the
acknowledged story-teller of the gang. But soon the men began to turn
in, stretching themselves at full length on the horse blankets in the
racklike bunks. The sounds of heavy breathing increased steadily, lights
were put out, and before the afterglow had faded from the sky, the gang
was asleep.

Vanamee, however, remained awake. The night was fine, warm; the sky
silver-grey with starlight. By and by there would be a moon. In the
first watch after the twilight, a faint puff of breeze came up out
of the south. From all around, the heavy penetrating smell of the
new-turned earth exhaled steadily into the darkness. After a while, when
the moon came up, he could see the vast brown breast of the earth turn
toward it. Far off, distant objects came into view: The giant oak tree
at Hooven's ranch house near the irrigating ditch on Los Muertos, the
skeleton-like tower of the windmill on Annixter's Home ranch, the clump
of willows along Broderson Creek close to the Long Trestle, and, last of
all, the venerable tower of the Mission of San Juan on the high ground
beyond the creek.

Thitherward, like homing pigeons, Vanamee's thoughts turned
irresistibly. Near to that tower, just beyond, in the little hollow,
hidden now from his sight, was the Seed ranch where Angele Varian
had lived. Straining his eyes, peering across the intervening levels,
Vanamee fancied he could almost see the line of venerable pear trees
in whose shadow she had been accustomed to wait for him. On many such
a night as this he had crossed the ranches to find her there. His mind
went back to that wonderful time of his life sixteen years before
this, when Angele was alive, when they two were involved in the sweet
intricacies of a love so fine, so pure, so marvellous that it seemed to
them a miracle, a manifestation, a thing veritably divine, put into the
life of them and the hearts of them by God Himself. To that they had
been born. For this love's sake they had come into the world, and
the mingling of their lives was to be the Perfect Life, the intended,
ordained union of the soul of man with the soul of woman, indissoluble,
harmonious as music, beautiful beyond all thought, a foretaste of
Heaven, a hostage of immortality.

No, he, Vanamee, could never, never forget, never was the edge of his
grief to lose its sharpness, never would the lapse of time blunt the
tooth of his pain. Once more, as he sat there, looking off across the
ranches, his eyes fixed on the ancient campanile of the Mission church,
the anguish that would not die leaped at his throat, tearing at his
heart, shaking him and rending him with a violence as fierce and as
profound as if it all had been but yesterday. The ache returned to his
heart a physical keen pain; his hands gripped tight together, twisting,
interlocked, his eyes filled with tears, his whole body shaken and riven
from head to heel.

He had lost her. God had not meant it, after all. The whole matter had
been a mistake. That vast, wonderful love that had come upon them had
been only the flimsiest mockery. Abruptly Vanamee rose. He knew the
night that was before him. At intervals throughout the course of his
prolonged wanderings, in the desert, on the mesa, deep in the canon,
lost and forgotten on the flanks of unnamed mountains, alone under the
stars and under the moon's white eye, these hours came to him, his grief
recoiling upon him like the recoil of a vast and terrible engine.
Then he must fight out the night, wrestling with his sorrow, praying
sometimes, incoherent, hardly conscious, asking “Why” of the night and
of the stars.

Such another night had come to him now. Until dawn he knew he must
struggle with his grief, torn with memories, his imagination assaulted
with visions of a vanished happiness. If this paroxysm of sorrow was to
assail him again that night, there was but one place for him to be. He
would go to the Mission--he would see Father Sarria; he would pass the
night in the deep shadow of the aged pear trees in the Mission garden.

He struck out across Quien Sabe, his face, the face of an ascetic, lean,
brown, infinitely sad, set toward the Mission church. In about an hour
he reached and crossed the road that led northward from Guadalajara
toward the Seed ranch, and, a little farther on, forded Broderson Creek
where it ran through one corner of the Mission land. He climbed the
hill and halted, out of breath from his brisk wall, at the end of the
colonnade of the Mission itself.

Until this moment Vanamee had not trusted himself to see the Mission at
night. On the occasion of his first daytime visit with Presley, he had
hurried away even before the twilight had set in, not daring for the
moment to face the crowding phantoms that in his imagination filled the
Mission garden after dark. In the daylight, the place had seemed
strange to him. None of his associations with the old building and its
surroundings were those of sunlight and brightness. Whenever, during his
long sojourns in the wilderness of the Southwest, he had called up the
picture in the eye of his mind, it had always appeared to him in the dim
mystery of moonless nights, the venerable pear trees black with shadow,
the fountain a thing to be heard rather than seen.

But as yet he had not entered the garden. That lay on the other side of
the Mission. Vanamee passed down the colonnade, with its uneven pavement
of worn red bricks, to the last door by the belfry tower, and rang the
little bell by pulling the leather thong that hung from a hole in the
door above the knob.

But the maid-servant, who, after a long interval opened the door,
blinking and confused at being roused from her sleep, told Vanamee that
Sarria was not in his room. Vanamee, however, was known to her as the
priest's protege and great friend, and she allowed him to enter, telling
him that, no doubt, he would find Sarria in the church itself. The
servant led the way down the cool adobe passage to a larger room that
occupied the entire width of the bottom of the belfry tower, and whence
a flight of aged steps led upward into the dark. At the foot of the
stairs was a door opening into the church. The servant admitted Vanamee,
closing the door behind her.

The interior of the Mission, a great oblong of white-washed adobe with
a flat ceiling, was lighted dimly by the sanctuary lamp that hung from
three long chains just over the chancel rail at the far end of the
church, and by two or three cheap kerosene lamps in brackets of
imitation bronze. All around the walls was the inevitable series of
pictures representing the Stations of the Cross. They were of a
hideous crudity of design and composition, yet were wrought out with an
innocent, unquestioning sincerity that was not without its charm. Each
picture framed alike in gilt, bore its suitable inscription in staring
black letters. “Simon, The Cyrenean, Helps Jesus to Carry His Cross.”
 “Saint Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus.” “Jesus Falls for the Fourth
Time,” and so on. Half-way up the length of the church the pews began,
coffin-like boxes of blackened oak, shining from years of friction, each
with its door; while over them, and built out from the wall, was the
pulpit, with its tarnished gilt sounding-board above it, like the raised
cover of a great hat-box. Between the pews, in the aisle, the violent
vermilion of a strip of ingrain carpet assaulted the eye. Farther on
were the steps to the altar, the chancel rail of worm-riddled oak, the
high altar, with its napery from the bargain counters of a San Francisco
store, the massive silver candlesticks, each as much as one man could
lift, the gift of a dead Spanish queen, and, last, the pictures of the
chancel, the Virgin in a glory, a Christ in agony on the cross, and
St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the Mission, the San Juan
Bautista, of the early days, a gaunt grey figure, in skins, two fingers
upraised in the gesture of benediction.

The air of the place was cool and damp, and heavy with the flat, sweet
scent of stale incense smoke. It was of a vault-like stillness, and the
closing of the door behind Vanamee reechoed from corner to corner with a
prolonged reverberation of thunder.

However, Father Sarria was not in the church. Vanamee took a couple of
turns the length of the aisle, looking about into the chapels on either
side of the chancel. But the building was deserted. The priest had been
there recently, nevertheless, for the altar furniture was in disarray,
as though he had been rearranging it but a moment before. On both sides
of the church and half-way up their length, the walls were pierced by
low archways, in which were massive wooden doors, clamped with iron
bolts. One of these doors, on the pulpit side of the church, stood ajar,
and stepping to it and pushing it wide open, Vanamee looked diagonally
across a little patch of vegetables--beets, radishes, and lettuce--to
the rear of the building that had once contained the cloisters, and
through an open window saw Father Sarria diligently polishing the silver
crucifix that usually stood on the high altar. Vanamee did not call
to the priest. Putting a finger to either temple, he fixed his eyes
steadily upon him for a moment as he moved about at his work. In a few
seconds he closed his eyes, but only part way. The pupils contracted;
his forehead lowered to an expression of poignant intensity. Soon
afterward he saw the priest pause abruptly in the act of drawing the
cover over the crucifix, looking about him from side to side. He turned
again to his work, and again came to a stop, perplexed, curious. With
uncertain steps, and evidently wondering why he did so, he came to the
door of the room and opened it, looking out into the night. Vanamee,
hidden in the deep shadow of the archway, did not move, but his eyes
closed, and the intense expression deepened on his face. The priest
hesitated, moved forward a step, turned back, paused again, then came
straight across the garden patch, brusquely colliding with Vanamee,
still motionless in the recess of the archway.

Sarria gave a great start, catching his breath.

“Oh--oh, it's you. Was it you I heard calling? No, I could not have
heard--I remember now. What a strange power! I am not sure that it is
right to do this thing, Vanamee. I--I HAD to come. I do not know why.
It is a great force--a power--I don't like it. Vanamee, sometimes it
frightens me.”

Vanamee put his chin in the air.

“If I had wanted to, sir, I could have made you come to me from back
there in the Quien Sabe ranch.”

The priest shook his head.

“It troubles me,” he said, “to think that my own will can count for so
little. Just now I could not resist. If a deep river had been between
us, I must have crossed it. Suppose I had been asleep now?” “It would
have been all the easier,” answered Vanamee. “I understand as little of
these things as you. But I think if you had been asleep, your power of
resistance would have been so much the more weakened.”

“Perhaps I should not have waked. Perhaps I should have come to you in
my sleep.”

“Perhaps.”

Sarria crossed himself. “It is occult,” he hazarded. “No; I do not like
it. Dear fellow,” he put his hand on Vanamee's shoulder, “don't--call
me that way again; promise. See,” he held out his hand, “I am all of a
tremble. There, we won't speak of it further. Wait for me a moment. I
have only to put the cross in its place, and a fresh altar cloth, and
then I am done. To-morrow is the feast of The Holy Cross, and I am
preparing against it. The night is fine. We will smoke a cigar in the
cloister garden.”

A few moments later the two passed out of the door on the other side of
the church, opposite the pulpit, Sarria adjusting a silk skull cap
on his tonsured head. He wore his cassock now, and was far more the
churchman in appearance than when Vanamee and Presley had seen him on a
former occasion.

They were now in the cloister garden. The place was charming. Everywhere
grew clumps of palms and magnolia trees. A grapevine, over a century
old, occupied a trellis in one angle of the walls which surrounded the
garden on two sides. Along the third side was the church itself, while
the fourth was open, the wall having crumbled away, its site marked
only by a line of eight great pear trees, older even than the grapevine,
gnarled, twisted, bearing no fruit. Directly opposite the pear trees,
in the south wall of the garden, was a round, arched portal, whose gate
giving upon the esplanade in front of the Mission was always closed.
Small gravelled walks, well kept, bordered with mignonette, twisted
about among the flower beds, and underneath the magnolia trees. In the
centre was a little fountain in a stone basin green with moss, while
just beyond, between the fountain and the pear trees, stood what was
left of a sun dial, the bronze gnomon, green with the beatings of
the weather, the figures on the half-circle of the dial worn away,
illegible.

But on the other side of the fountain, and directly opposite the door
of the Mission, ranged against the wall, were nine graves--three with
headstones, the rest with slabs. Two of Sarria's predecessors were
buried here; three of the graves were those of Mission Indians. One was
thought to contain a former alcalde of Guadalajara; two more held the
bodies of De La Cuesta and his young wife (taking with her to the grave
the illusion of her husband's love), and the last one, the ninth, at
the end of the line, nearest the pear trees, was marked by a little
headstone, the smallest of any, on which, together with the proper
dates--only sixteen years apart--was cut the name “Angele Varian.”

But the quiet, the repose, the isolation of the little cloister garden
was infinitely delicious. It was a tiny corner of the great valley that
stretched in all directions around it--shut off, discreet, romantic, a
garden of dreams, of enchantments, of illusions. Outside there, far
off, the great grim world went clashing through its grooves, but in
here never an echo of the grinding of its wheels entered to jar upon the
subdued modulation of the fountain's uninterrupted murmur.

Sarria and Vanamee found their way to a stone bench against the side
wall of the Mission, near the door from which they had just issued,
and sat down, Sarria lighting a cigar, Vanamee rolling and smoking
cigarettes in Mexican fashion.

All about them widened the vast calm night. All the stars were out. The
moon was coming up. There was no wind, no sound. The insistent flowing
of the fountain seemed only as the symbol of the passing of time, a
thing that was understood rather than heard, inevitable, prolonged. At
long intervals, a faint breeze, hardly more than a breath, found its way
into the garden over the enclosing walls, and passed overhead, spreading
everywhere the delicious, mingled perfume of magnolia blossoms, of
mignonette, of moss, of grass, and all the calm green life silently
teeming within the enclosure of the walls.

From where he sat, Vanamee, turning his head, could look out underneath
the pear trees to the north. Close at hand, a little valley lay between
the high ground on which the Mission was built, and the line of low
hills just beyond Broderson Creek on the Quien Sabe. In here was the
Seed ranch, which Angele's people had cultivated, a unique and beautiful
stretch of five hundred acres, planted thick with roses, violets,
lilies, tulips, iris, carnations, tube-roses, poppies, heliotrope--all
manner and description of flowers, five hundred acres of them, solid,
thick, exuberant; blooming and fading, and leaving their seed or slips
to be marketed broadcast all over the United States. This had been the
vocation of Angele's parents--raising flowers for their seeds. All over
the country the Seed ranch was known. Now it was arid, almost dry, but
when in full flower, toward the middle of summer, the sight of these
half-thousand acres royal with colour--vermilion, azure, flaming
yellow--was a marvel. When an east wind blew, men on the streets of
Bonneville, nearly twelve miles away, could catch the scent of this
valley of flowers, this chaos of perfume.

And into this life of flowers, this world of colour, this atmosphere
oppressive and clogged and cloyed and thickened with sweet odour, Angele
had been born. There she had lived her sixteen years. There she had
died. It was not surprising that Vanamee, with his intense, delicate
sensitiveness to beauty, his almost abnormal capacity for great
happiness, had been drawn to her, had loved her so deeply.

She came to him from out of the flowers, the smell of the roses in her
hair of gold, that hung in two straight plaits on either side of her
face; the reflection of the violets in the profound dark blue of her
eyes, perplexing, heavy-lidded, almond-shaped, oriental; the aroma
and the imperial red of the carnations in her lips, with their almost
Egyptian fulness; the whiteness of the lilies, the perfume of the
lilies, and the lilies' slender balancing grace in her neck. Her hands
disengaged the odour of the heliotropes. The folds of her dress gave off
the enervating scent of poppies. Her feet were redolent of hyacinths.

For a long time after sitting down upon the bench, neither the priest
nor Vanamee spoke. But after a while Sarria took his cigar from his
lips, saying:

“How still it is! This is a beautiful old garden, peaceful, very quiet.
Some day I shall be buried here. I like to remember that; and you, too,
Vanamee.”

“Quien sabe?”

“Yes, you, too. Where else? No, it is better here, yonder, by the side
of the little girl.”

“I am not able to look forward yet, sir. The things that are to be are
somehow nothing to me at all. For me they amount to nothing.”

“They amount to everything, my boy.”

“Yes, to one part of me, but not to the part of me that belonged to
Angele--the best part. Oh, you don't know,” he exclaimed with a sudden
movement, “no one can understand. What is it to me when you tell me that
sometime after I shall die too, somewhere, in a vague place you call
Heaven, I shall see her again? Do you think that the idea of that ever
made any one's sorrow easier to bear? Ever took the edge from any one's
grief?”

“But you believe that----”

“Oh, believe, believe!” echoed the other. “What do I believe? I don't
know. I believe, or I don't believe. I can remember what she WAS, but
I cannot hope what she will be. Hope, after all, is only memory seen
reversed. When I try to see her in another life--whatever you call
it--in Heaven--beyond the grave--this vague place of yours; when I try
to see her there, she comes to my imagination only as what she was,
material, earthly, as I loved her. Imperfect, you say; but that is as
I saw her, and as I saw her, I loved her; and as she WAS, material,
earthly, imperfect, she loved me. It's that, that I want,” he exclaimed.
“I don't want her changed. I don't want her spiritualised, exalted,
glorified, celestial. I want HER. I think it is only this feeling that
has kept me from killing myself. I would rather be unhappy in the
memory of what she actually was, than be happy in the realisation of her
transformed, changed, made celestial. I am only human. Her soul! That
was beautiful, no doubt. But, again, it was something very vague,
intangible, hardly more than a phrase. But the touch of her hand was
real, the sound of her voice was real, the clasp of her arms about my
neck was real. Oh,” he cried, shaken with a sudden wrench of passion,
“give those back to me. Tell your God to give those back to me--the
sound of her voice, the touch of her hand, the clasp of her dear arms,
REAL, REAL, and then you may talk to me of Heaven.”

Sarria shook his head. “But when you meet her again,” he observed, “in
Heaven, you, too, will be changed. You will see her spiritualised, with
spiritual eyes. As she is now, she does not appeal to you. I understand
that. It is because, as you say, you are only human, while she is
divine. But when you come to be like her, as she is now, you will know
her as she really is, not as she seemed to be, because her voice was
sweet, because her hair was pretty, because her hand was warm in yours.
Vanamee, your talk is that of a foolish child. You are like one of
the Corinthians to whom Paul wrote. Do you remember? Listen now. I can
recall the words, and such words, beautiful and terrible at the same
time, such a majesty. They march like soldiers with trumpets. 'But some
man will say'--as you have said just now--'How are the dead raised up?
And with what body do they come? Thou fool! That which thou sowest is
not quickened except it die, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not
that body that shall be, but bare grain. It may chance of wheat, or of
some other grain. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and
to every seed his own body.... It is sown a natural body; it is raised
a spiritual body.' It is because you are a natural body that you cannot
understand her, nor wish for her as a spiritual body, but when you are
both spiritual, then you shall know each other as you are--know as you
never knew before. Your grain of wheat is your symbol of immortality.
You bury it in the earth. It dies, and rises again a thousand times more
beautiful. Vanamee, your dear girl was only a grain of humanity that
we have buried here, and the end is not yet. But all this is so old, so
old. The world learned it a thousand years ago, and yet each man that
has ever stood by the open grave of any one he loved must learn it all
over again from the beginning.”

Vanamee was silent for a moment, looking off with unseeing eyes between
the trunks of the pear trees, over the little valley.

“That may all be as you say,” he answered after a while. “I have not
learned it yet, in any case. Now, I only know that I love her--oh, as if
it all were yesterday--and that I am suffering, suffering, always.”

He leaned forward, his head supported on his clenched fists, the
infinite sadness of his face deepening like a shadow, the tears brimming
in his deep-set eyes. A question that he must ask, which involved
the thing that was scarcely to be thought of, occurred to him at this
moment. After hesitating for a long moment, he said:

“I have been away a long time, and I have had no news of this place
since I left. Is there anything to tell, Father? Has any discovery been
made, any suspicion developed, as to--the Other?”

The priest shook his head.

“Not a word, not a whisper. It is a mystery. It always will be.”

Vanamee clasped his head between his clenched fists, rocking himself to
and fro.

“Oh, the terror of it,” he murmured. “The horror of it. And she--think
of it, Sarria, only sixteen, a little girl; so innocent, that she never
knew what wrong meant, pure as a little child is pure, who believed that
all things were good; mature only in her love. And to be struck down
like that, while your God looked down from Heaven and would not take her
part.” All at once he seemed to lose control of himself. One of those
furies of impotent grief and wrath that assailed him from time to time,
blind, insensate, incoherent, suddenly took possession of him. A
torrent of words issued from his lips, and he flung out an arm, the
fist clenched, in a fierce, quick gesture, partly of despair, partly of
defiance, partly of supplication. “No, your God would not take her part.
Where was God's mercy in that? Where was Heaven's protection in that?
Where was the loving kindness you preach about? Why did God give her
life if it was to be stamped out? Why did God give her the power of love
if it was to come to nothing? Sarria, listen to me. Why did God make
her so divinely pure if He permitted that abomination? Ha!” he exclaimed
bitterly, “your God! Why, an Apache buck would have been more merciful.
Your God! There is no God. There is only the Devil. The Heaven you pray
to is only a joke, a wretched trick, a delusion. It is only Hell that is
real.”

Sarria caught him by the arm.

“You are a fool and a child,” he exclaimed, “and it is blasphemy that
you are saying. I forbid it. You understand? I forbid it.”

Vanamee turned on him with a sudden cry. “Then, tell your God to give
her back to me!”

Sarria started away from him, his eyes widening in astonishment,
surprised out of all composure by the other's outburst. Vanamee's
swarthy face was pale, the sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes were marked
with great black shadows. The priest no longer recognised him. The
face, that face of the ascetic, lean, framed in its long black hair and
pointed beard, was quivering with the excitement of hallucination. It
was the face of the inspired shepherds of the Hebraic legends, living
close to nature, the younger prophets of Israel, dwellers in the
wilderness, solitary, imaginative, believing in the Vision, having
strange delusions, gifted with strange powers. In a brief second of
thought, Sarria understood. Out into the wilderness, the vast arid
desert of the Southwest, Vanamee had carried his grief. For days, for
weeks, months even, he had been alone, a solitary speck lost in the
immensity of the horizons; continually he was brooding, haunted with his
sorrow, thinking, thinking, often hard put to it for food. The body was
ill-nourished, and the mind, concentrated forever upon one subject, had
recoiled upon itself, had preyed upon the naturally nervous temperament,
till the imagination had become exalted, morbidly active, diseased,
beset with hallucinations, forever in search of the manifestation, of
the miracle. It was small wonder that, bringing a fancy so distorted
back to the scene of a vanished happiness, Vanamee should be racked with
the most violent illusions, beset in the throes of a veritable hysteria.

“Tell your God to give her back to me,” he repeated with fierce
insistence.

It was the pitch of mysticism, the imagination harassed and goaded
beyond the normal round, suddenly flipping from the circumference,
spinning off at a tangent, out into the void, where all things seemed
possible, hurtling through the dark there, groping for the supernatural,
clamouring for the miracle. And it was also the human, natural protest
against the inevitable, the irrevocable; the spasm of revolt under the
sting of death, the rebellion of the soul at the victory of the grave.

“He can give her back to me if He only will,” Vanamee cried. “Sarria,
you must help me. I tell you--I warn you, sir, I can't last much longer
under it. My head is all wrong with it--I've no more hold on my mind.
Something must happen or I shall lose my senses. I am breaking down
under it all, my body and my mind alike. Bring her to me; make God show
her to me. If all tales are true, it would not be the first time. If I
cannot have her, at least let me see her as she was, real, earthly, not
her spirit, her ghost. I want her real self, undefiled again. If this is
dementia, then let me be demented. But help me, you and your God; create
the delusion, do the miracle.”

“Stop!” cried the priest again, shaking him roughly by the shoulder.
“Stop. Be yourself. This is dementia; but I shall NOT let you be
demented. Think of what you are saying. Bring her back to you! Is
that the way of God? I thought you were a man; this is the talk of a
weak-minded girl.”

Vanamee stirred abruptly in his place, drawing a long breath and looking
about him vaguely, as if he came to himself.

“You are right,” he muttered. “I hardly know what I am saying at times.
But there are moments when my whole mind and soul seem to rise up in
rebellion against what has happened; when it seems to me that I am
stronger than death, and that if I only knew how to use the strength
of my will, concentrate my power of thought--volition--that I could--I
don't know--not call her back--but--something----”

“A diseased and distorted mind is capable of hallucinations, if that is
what you mean,” observed Sarria.

“Perhaps that is what I mean. Perhaps I want only the delusion, after
all.”

Sarria did not reply, and there was a long silence. In the damp south
corners of the walls a frog began to croak at exact intervals. The
little fountain rippled monotonously, and a magnolia flower dropped from
one of the trees, falling straight as a plummet through the motionless
air, and settling upon the gravelled walk with a faint rustling sound.
Otherwise the stillness was profound.

A little later, the priest's cigar, long since out, slipped from his
fingers to the ground. He began to nod gently. Vanamee touched his arm.

“Asleep, sir?”

The other started, rubbing his eyes.

“Upon my word, I believe I was.”

“Better go to bed, sir. I am not tired. I think I shall sit out here a
little longer.”

“Well, perhaps I would be better off in bed. YOUR bed is always ready
for you here whenever you want to use it.”

“No--I shall go back to Quien Sabe--later. Good-night, sir.”

“Good-night, my boy.”

Vanamee was left alone. For a long time he sat motionless in his place,
his elbows on his knees, his chin propped in his hands. The minutes
passed--then the hours. The moon climbed steadily higher among the
stars. Vanamee rolled and smoked cigarette after cigarette, the blue
haze of smoke hanging motionless above his head, or drifting in slowly
weaving filaments across the open spaces of the garden.

But the influence of the old enclosure, this corner of romance and
mystery, this isolated garden of dreams, savouring of the past, with its
legends, its graves, its crumbling sun dial, its fountain with its rime
of moss, was not to be resisted. Now that the priest had left him, the
same exaltation of spirit that had seized upon Vanamee earlier in the
evening, by degrees grew big again in his mind and imagination. His
sorrow assaulted him like the flagellations of a fine whiplash, and his
love for Angele rose again in his heart, it seemed to him never so deep,
so tender, so infinitely strong. No doubt, it was his familiarity with
the Mission garden, his clear-cut remembrance of it, as it was in the
days when he had met Angele there, tallying now so exactly with the
reality there under his eyes, that brought her to his imagination so
vividly. As yet he dared not trust himself near her grave, but, for the
moment, he rose and, his hands clasped behind him, walked slowly from
point to point amid the tiny gravelled walks, recalling the incidents of
eighteen years ago. On the bench he had quitted he and Angele had often
sat. Here by the crumbling sun dial, he recalled the night when he had
kissed her for the first time. Here, again, by the rim of the fountain,
with its fringe of green, she once had paused, and, baring her arm to
the shoulder, had thrust it deep into the water, and then withdrawing
it, had given it to him to kiss, all wet and cool; and here, at last,
under the shadow of the pear trees they had sat, evening after evening,
looking off over the little valley below them, watching the night build
itself, dome-like, from horizon to zenith.

Brusquely Vanamee turned away from the prospect. The Seed ranch was dark
at this time of the year, and flowerless. Far off toward its centre, he
had caught a brief glimpse of the house where Angele had lived, and a
faint light burning in its window. But he turned from it sharply. The
deep-seated travail of his grief abruptly reached the paroxysm. With
long strides he crossed the garden and reentered the Mission church
itself, plunging into the coolness of its atmosphere as into a bath.
What he searched for he did not know, or, rather, did not define. He
knew only that he was suffering, that a longing for Angele, for some
object around which his great love could enfold itself, was tearing
at his heart with iron teeth. He was ready to be deluded; craved the
hallucination; begged pitifully for the illusion; anything rather than
the empty, tenantless night, the voiceless silence, the vast loneliness
of the overspanning arc of the heavens.

Before the chancel rail of the altar, under the sanctuary lamp, Vanamee
sank upon his knees, his arms folded upon the rail, his head bowed down
upon them. He prayed, with what words he could not say for what he did
not understand--for help, merely, for relief, for an Answer to his cry.

It was upon that, at length, that his disordered mind concentrated
itself, an Answer--he demanded, he implored an Answer. Not a vague
visitation of Grace, not a formless sense of Peace; but an Answer,
something real, even if the reality were fancied, a voice out of the
night, responding to his, a hand in the dark clasping his groping
fingers, a breath, human, warm, fragrant, familiar, like a soft, sweet
caress on his shrunken cheeks. Alone there in the dim half-light of
the decaying Mission, with its crumbling plaster, its naive crudity
of ornament and picture, he wrestled fiercely with his desires--words,
fragments of sentences, inarticulate, incoherent, wrenched from his
tight-shut teeth.

But the Answer was not in the church. Above him, over the high altar,
the Virgin in a glory, with downcast eyes and folded hands, grew vague
and indistinct in the shadow, the colours fading, tarnished by centuries
of incense smoke. The Christ in agony on the Cross was but a lamentable
vision of tormented anatomy, grey flesh, spotted with crimson. The St.
John, the San Juan Bautista, patron saint of the Mission, the gaunt
figure in skins, two fingers upraised in the gesture of benediction,
gazed stolidly out into the half-gloom under the ceiling, ignoring the
human distress that beat itself in vain against the altar rail below,
and Angele remained as before--only a memory, far distant, intangible,
lost.

Vanamee rose, turning his back upon the altar with a vague gesture of
despair. He crossed the church, and issuing from the low-arched door
opposite the pulpit, once more stepped out into the garden. Here, at
least, was reality. The warm, still air descended upon him like a cloak,
grateful, comforting, dispelling the chill that lurked in the damp mould
of plaster and crumbling adobe.

But now he found his way across the garden on the other side of the
fountain, where, ranged against the eastern wall, were nine graves.
Here Angele was buried, in the smallest grave of them all, marked by the
little headstone, with its two dates, only sixteen years apart. To this
spot, at last, he had returned, after the years spent in the desert, the
wilderness--after all the wanderings of the Long Trail. Here, if ever,
he must have a sense of her nearness. Close at hand, a short four feet
under that mound of grass, was the form he had so often held in the
embrace of his arms; the face, the very face he had kissed, that face
with the hair of gold making three-cornered the round white forehead,
the violet-blue eyes, heavy-lidded, with their strange oriental slant
upward toward the temples; the sweet full lips, almost Egyptian in their
fulness--all that strange, perplexing, wonderful beauty, so troublous,
so enchanting, so out of all accepted standards.

He bent down, dropping upon one knee, a hand upon the headstone, and
read again the inscription. Then instinctively his hand left the stone
and rested upon the low mound of turf, touching it with the softness of
a caress; and then, before he was aware of it, he was stretched at full
length upon the earth, beside the grave, his arms about the low mound,
his lips pressed against the grass with which it was covered. The
pent-up grief of nearly twenty years rose again within his heart, and
overflowed, irresistible, violent, passionate. There was no one to
see, no one to hear. Vanamee had no thought of restraint. He no longer
wrestled with his pain--strove against it. There was even a sense of
relief in permitting himself to be overcome. But the reaction from this
outburst was equally violent. His revolt against the inevitable, his
protest against the grave, shook him from head to foot, goaded him
beyond all bounds of reason, hounded him on and into the domain of
hysteria, dementia. Vanamee was no longer master of himself--no longer
knew what he was doing.

At first, he had been content with merely a wild, unreasoned cry to
Heaven that Angele should be restored to him, but the vast egotism that
seems to run through all forms of disordered intelligence gave his
fancy another turn. He forgot God. He no longer reckoned with Heaven. He
arrogated their powers to himself--struggled to be, of his own unaided
might, stronger than death, more powerful than the grave. He had
demanded of Sarria that God should restore Angele to him, but now he
appealed directly to Angele herself. As he lay there, his arms clasped
about her grave, she seemed so near to him that he fancied she MUST
hear. And suddenly, at this moment, his recollection of his strange
compelling power--the same power by which he had called Presley to him
half-way across the Quien Sabe ranch, the same power which had brought
Sarria to his side that very evening--recurred to him. Concentrating his
mind upon the one object with which it had so long been filled, Vanamee,
his eyes closed, his face buried in his arms, exclaimed:

“Come to me--Angele--don't you hear? Come to me.”

But the Answer was not in the Grave. Below him the voiceless Earth lay
silent, moveless, withholding the secret, jealous of that which it held
so close in its grip, refusing to give up that which had been confided
to its keeping, untouched by the human anguish that above there, on its
surface, clutched with despairing hands at a grave long made. The Earth
that only that morning had been so eager, so responsive to the lightest
summons, so vibrant with Life, now at night, holding death within its
embrace, guarding inviolate the secret of the Grave, was deaf to all
entreaty, refused the Answer, and Angele remained as before, only a
memory, far distant, intangible, lost.

Vanamee lifted his head, looking about him with unseeing eyes, trembling
with the exertion of his vain effort. But he could not as yet allow
himself to despair. Never before had that curious power of attraction
failed him. He felt himself to be so strong in this respect that he
was persuaded if he exerted himself to the limit of his capacity,
something--he could not say what--must come of it. If it was only
a self-delusion, an hallucination, he told himself that he would be
content.

Almost of its own accord, his distorted mind concentrated itself again,
every thought, all the power of his will riveting themselves upon
Angele. As if she were alive, he summoned her to him. His eyes, fixed
upon the name cut into the headstone, contracted, the pupils growing
small, his fists shut tight, his nerves braced rigid.

For a few seconds he stood thus, breathless, expectant, awaiting the
manifestation, the Miracle. Then, without knowing why, hardly conscious
of what was transpiring, he found that his glance was leaving the
headstone, was turning from the grave. Not only this, but his whole
body was following the direction of his eyes. Before he knew it, he was
standing with his back to Angele's grave, was facing the north, facing
the line of pear trees and the little valley where the Seed ranch lay.
At first, he thought this was because he had allowed his will to weaken,
the concentrated power of his mind to grow slack. And once more turning
toward the grave, he banded all his thoughts together in a consummate
effort, his teeth grinding together, his hands pressed to his forehead.
He forced himself to the notion that Angele was alive, and to this
creature of his imagination he addressed himself:

“Angele!” he cried in a low voice; “Angele, I am calling you--do you
hear? Come to me--come to me now, now.”

Instead of the Answer he demanded, that inexplicable counter-influence
cut across the current of his thought. Strive as he would against it,
he must veer to the north, toward the pear trees. Obeying it, he turned,
and, still wondering, took a step in that direction, then another and
another. The next moment he came abruptly to himself, in the black
shadow of the pear trees themselves, and, opening his eyes, found
himself looking off over the Seed ranch, toward the little house in the
centre where Angele had once lived.

Perplexed, he returned to the grave, once more calling upon the
resources of his will, and abruptly, so soon as these reached a certain
point, the same cross-current set in. He could no longer keep his eyes
upon the headstone, could no longer think of the grave and what it held.
He must face the north; he must be drawn toward the pear trees, and
there left standing in their shadow, looking out aimlessly over the Seed
ranch, wondering, bewildered. Farther than this the influence never
drew him, but up to this point--the line of pear trees--it was not to be
resisted.

For a time the peculiarity of the affair was of more interest to Vanamee
than even his own distress of spirit, and once or twice he repeated the
attempt, almost experimentally, and invariably with the same result: so
soon as he seemed to hold Angele in the grip of his mind, he was moved
to turn about toward the north, and hurry toward the pear trees on the
crest of the hill that over-looked the little valley.

But Vanamee's unhappiness was too keen this night for him to dwell long
upon the vagaries of his mind. Submitting at length, and abandoning the
grave, he flung himself down in the black shade of the pear trees, his
chin in his hands, and resigned himself finally and definitely to the
inrush of recollection and the exquisite grief of an infinite regret.

To his fancy, she came to him again. He put himself back many years. He
remembered the warm nights of July and August, profoundly still, the
sky encrusted with stars, the little Mission garden exhaling the mingled
perfumes that all through the scorching day had been distilled under
the steady blaze of a summer's sun. He saw himself as another person,
arriving at this, their rendezvous. All day long she had been in
his mind. All day long he had looked forward to this quiet hour that
belonged to her. It was dark. He could see nothing, but, by and by,
he heard a step, a gentle rustle of the grass on the slope of the hill
pressed under an advancing foot. Then he saw the faint gleam of pallid
gold of her hair, a barely visible glow in the starlight, and heard the
murmur of her breath in the lapse of the over-passing breeze. And then,
in the midst of the gentle perfumes of the garden, the perfumes of the
magnolia flowers, of the mignonette borders, of the crumbling walls,
there expanded a new odour, or the faint mingling of many odours, the
smell of the roses that lingered in her hair, of the lilies that exhaled
from her neck, of the heliotrope that disengaged itself from her hands
and arms, and of the hyacinths with which her little feet were redolent,
And then, suddenly, it was herself--her eyes, heavy-lidded, violet blue,
full of the love of him; her sweet full lips speaking his name; her
hands clasping his hands, his shoulders, his neck--her whole dear body
giving itself into his embrace; her lips against his; her hands holding
his head, drawing his face down to hers.

Vanamee, as he remembered all this, flung out an arm with a cry of pain,
his eyes searching the gloom, all his mind in strenuous mutiny against
the triumph of Death. His glance shot swiftly out across the night,
unconsciously following the direction from which Angele used to come to
him.

“Come to me now,” he exclaimed under his breath, tense and rigid with
the vast futile effort of his will. “Come to me now, now. Don't you hear
me, Angele? You must, you must come.”

Suddenly Vanamee returned to himself with the abruptness of a blow.
His eyes opened. He half raised himself from the ground. Swiftly his
scattered wits readjusted themselves. Never more sane, never more
himself, he rose to his feet and stood looking off into the night across
the Seed ranch.

“What was it?” he murmured, bewildered.

He looked around him from side to side, as if to get in touch with
reality once more. He looked at his hands, at the rough bark of the pear
tree next which he stood, at the streaked and rain-eroded walls of
the Mission and garden. The exaltation of his mind calmed itself; the
unnatural strain under which he laboured slackened. He became thoroughly
master of himself again, matter-of-fact, practical, keen.

But just so sure as his hands were his own, just so sure as the bark
of the pear tree was rough, the mouldering adobe of the Mission walls
damp--just so sure had Something occurred. It was vague, intangible,
appealing only to some strange, nameless sixth sense, but none the less
perceptible. His mind, his imagination, sent out from him across the
night, across the little valley below him, speeding hither and thither
through the dark, lost, confused, had suddenly paused, hovering, had
found Something. It had not returned to him empty-handed. It had come
back, but now there was a change--mysterious, illusive. There were no
words for this that had transpired. But for the moment, one thing only
was certain. The night was no longer voiceless, the dark was no longer
empty. Far off there, beyond the reach of vision, unlocalised, strange,
a ripple had formed on the still black pool of the night, had formed,
flashed one instant to the stars, then swiftly faded again. The night
shut down once more. There was no sound--nothing stirred.

For the moment, Vanamee stood transfixed, struck rigid in his place,
stupefied, his eyes staring, breathless with utter amazement. Then,
step by step, he shrank back into the deeper shadow, treading with the
infinite precaution of a prowling leopard. A qualm of something very
much like fear seized upon him. But immediately on the heels of this
first impression came the doubt of his own senses. Whatever had happened
had been so ephemeral, so faint, so intangible, that now he wondered
if he had not deceived himself, after all. But the reaction followed.
Surely, there had been Something. And from that moment began for him
the most poignant uncertainty of mind. Gradually he drew back into the
garden, holding his breath, listening to every faintest sound, walking
upon tiptoe. He reached the fountain, and wetting his hands, passed them
across his forehead and eyes. Once more he stood listening. The silence
was profound.

Troubled, disturbed, Vanamee went away, passing out of the garden,
descending the hill. He forded Broderson Creek where it intersected the
road to Guadalajara, and went on across Quien Sabe, walking slowly,
his head bent down, his hands clasped behind his back, thoughtful,
perplexed.
