It was high noon, and the rays of the sun, that hung poised directly
overhead in an intolerable white glory, fell straight as plummets upon
the roofs and streets of Guadalajara. The adobe walls and sparse brick
sidewalks of the drowsing town radiated the heat in an oily, quivering
shimmer. The leaves of the eucalyptus trees around the Plaza drooped
motionless, limp and relaxed under the scorching, searching blaze.
The shadows of these trees had shrunk to their smallest circumference,
contracting close about the trunks. The shade had dwindled to the
breadth of a mere line. The sun was everywhere. The heat exhaling
from brick and plaster and metal met the heat that steadily descended
blanketwise and smothering, from the pale, scorched sky. Only the
lizards--they lived in chinks of the crumbling adobe and in interstices
of the sidewalk--remained without, motionless, as if stuffed, their eyes
closed to mere slits, basking, stupefied with heat. At long intervals
the prolonged drone of an insect developed out of the silence, vibrated
a moment in a soothing, somnolent, long note, then trailed slowly into
the quiet again. Somewhere in the interior of one of the 'dobe houses a
guitar snored and hummed sleepily. On the roof of the hotel a group of
pigeons cooed incessantly with subdued, liquid murmurs, very plaintive;
a cat, perfectly white, with a pink nose and thin, pink lips, dozed
complacently on a fence rail, full in the sun. In a corner of the Plaza
three hens wallowed in the baking hot dust their wings fluttering,
clucking comfortably.

And this was all. A Sunday repose prevailed the whole moribund town,
peaceful, profound. A certain pleasing numbness, a sense of grateful
enervation exhaled from the scorching plaster. There was no movement, no
sound of human business. The faint hum of the insect, the intermittent
murmur of the guitar, the mellow complainings of the pigeons, the
prolonged purr of the white cat, the contented clucking of the
hens--all these noises mingled together to form a faint, drowsy bourdon,
prolonged, stupefying, suggestive of an infinite quiet, of a calm,
complacent life, centuries old, lapsing gradually to its end under the
gorgeous loneliness of a cloudless, pale blue sky and the steady fire of
an interminable sun.

In Solotari's Spanish-Mexican restaurant, Vanamee and Presley sat
opposite each other at one of the tables near the door, a bottle of
white wine, tortillas, and an earthen pot of frijoles between them. They
were the sole occupants of the place. It was the day that Annixter had
chosen for his barn-dance and, in consequence, Quien Sabe was in fete
and work suspended. Presley and Vanamee had arranged to spend the day in
each other's company, lunching at Solotari's and taking a long tramp in
the afternoon. For the moment they sat back in their chairs, their meal
all but finished. Solotari brought black coffee and a small carafe of
mescal, and retiring to a corner of the room, went to sleep.

All through the meal Presley had been wondering over a certain change he
observed in his friend. He looked at him again.

Vanamee's lean, spare face was of an olive pallor. His long, black hair,
such as one sees in the saints and evangelists of the pre-Raphaelite
artists, hung over his ears. Presley again remarked his pointed beard,
black and fine, growing from the hollow cheeks. He looked at his face,
a face like that of a young seer, like a half-inspired shepherd of
the Hebraic legends, a dweller in the wilderness, gifted with strange
powers. He was dressed as when Presley had first met him, herding his
sheep, in brown canvas overalls, thrust into top boots; grey flannel
shirt, open at the throat, showing the breast ruddy with tan; the waist
encircled with a cartridge belt, empty of cartridges.

But now, as Presley took more careful note of him, he was surprised to
observe a certain new look in Vanamee's deep-set eyes. He remembered now
that all through the morning Vanamee had been singularly reserved.
He was continually drifting into reveries, abstracted, distrait.
Indubitably, something of moment had happened.

At length Vanamee spoke. Leaning back in his chair, his thumbs in his
belt, his bearded chin upon his breast, his voice was the even monotone
of one speaking in his sleep.

He told Presley in a few words what had happened during the first
night he had spent in the garden of the old Mission, of the Answer,
half-fancied, half-real, that had come to him.

“To no other person but you would I speak of this,” he said, “but you,
I think, will understand--will be sympathetic, at least, and I feel the
need of unburdening myself of it to some one. At first I would not trust
my own senses. I was sure I had deceived myself, but on a second
night it happened again. Then I was afraid--or no, not afraid, but
disturbed--oh, shaken to my very heart's core. I resolved to go no
further in the matter, never again to put it to test. For a long time I
stayed away from the Mission, occupying myself with my work, keeping
it out of my mind. But the temptation was too strong. One night I found
myself there again, under the black shadow of the pear trees calling for
Angele, summoning her from out the dark, from out the night. This time
the Answer was prompt, unmistakable. I cannot explain to you what it
was, nor how it came to me, for there was no sound. I saw absolutely
nothing but the empty night. There was no moon. But somewhere off there
over the little valley, far off, the darkness was troubled; that ME
that went out upon my thought--out from the Mission garden, out over the
valley, calling for her, searching for her, found, I don't know what,
but found a resting place--a companion. Three times since then I have
gone to the Mission garden at night. Last night was the third time.”

He paused, his eyes shining with excitement. Presley leaned forward
toward him, motionless with intense absorption.

“Well--and last night,” he prompted.

Vanamee stirred in his seat, his glance fell, he drummed an instant upon
the table.

“Last night,” he answered, “there was--there was a change. The Answer
was--” he drew a deep breath--“nearer.”

“You are sure?”

The other smiled with absolute certainty.

“It was not that I found the Answer sooner, easier. I could not be
mistaken. No, that which has troubled the darkness, that which has
entered into the empty night--is coming nearer to me--physically nearer,
actually nearer.”

His voice sank again. His face like the face of younger prophets, the
seers, took on a half-inspired expression. He looked vaguely before him
with unseeing eyes.

“Suppose,” he murmured, “suppose I stand there under the pear trees
at night and call her again and again, and each time the Answer comes
nearer and nearer and I wait until at last one night, the supreme night
of all, she--she----”

Suddenly the tension broke. With a sharp cry and a violent uncertain
gesture of the hand Vanamee came to himself.

“Oh,” he exclaimed, “what is it? Do I dare? What does it mean? There are
times when it appals me and there are times when it thrills me with
a sweetness and a happiness that I have not known since she died. The
vagueness of it! How can I explain it to you, this that happens when I
call to her across the night--that faint, far-off, unseen tremble in the
darkness, that intangible, scarcely perceptible stir. Something neither
heard nor seen, appealing to a sixth sense only. Listen, it is something
like this: On Quien Sabe, all last week, we have been seeding the earth.
The grain is there now under the earth buried in the dark, in the black
stillness, under the clods. Can you imagine the first--the very first
little quiver of life that the grain of wheat must feel after it is
sown, when it answers to the call of the sun, down there in the dark of
the earth, blind, deaf; the very first stir from the inert, long, long
before any physical change has occurred,--long before the microscope
could discover the slightest change,--when the shell first tightens with
the first faint premonition of life? Well, it is something as illusive
as that.” He paused again, dreaming, lost in a reverie, then, just above
a whisper, murmured:

“'That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die,'... and she,
Angele... died.”

“You could not have been mistaken?” said Presley. “You were sure that
there was something? Imagination can do so much and the influence of the
surroundings was strong. How impossible it would be that anything SHOULD
happen. And you say you heard nothing, saw nothing.”

“I believe,” answered Vanamee, “in a sixth sense, or, rather, a whole
system of other unnamed senses beyond the reach of our understanding.
People who live much alone and close to nature experience the sensation
of it. Perhaps it is something fundamental that we share with plants and
animals. The same thing that sends the birds south long before the first
colds, the same thing that makes the grain of wheat struggle up to meet
the sun. And this sense never deceives. You may see wrong, hear wrong,
but once touch this sixth sense and it acts with absolute fidelity, you
are certain. No, I hear nothing in the Mission garden. I see nothing,
nothing touches me, but I am CERTAIN for all that.”

Presley hesitated for a moment, then he asked:

“Shall you go back to the garden again? Make the test again?” “I don't
know.”

“Strange enough,” commented Presley, wondering.

Vanamee sank back in his chair, his eyes growing vacant again:

“Strange enough,” he murmured.

There was a long silence. Neither spoke nor moved. There, in that
moribund, ancient town, wrapped in its siesta, flagellated with heat,
deserted, ignored, baking in a noon-day silence, these two strange men,
the one a poet by nature, the other by training, both out of tune with
their world, dreamers, introspective, morbid, lost and unfamiliar at
that end-of-the-century time, searching for a sign, groping and baffled
amidst the perplexing obscurity of the Delusion, sat over empty wine
glasses, silent with the pervading silence that surrounded them, hearing
only the cooing of doves and the drone of bees, the quiet so profound,
that at length they could plainly distinguish at intervals the puffing
and coughing of a locomotive switching cars in the station yard of
Bonneville.

It was, no doubt, this jarring sound that at length roused Presley from
his lethargy. The two friends rose; Solotari very sleepily came forward;
they paid for the luncheon, and stepping out into the heat and glare of
the streets of the town, passed on through it and took the road that led
northward across a corner of Dyke's hop fields. They were bound for the
hills in the northeastern corner of Quien Sabe. It was the same walk
which Presley had taken on the previous occasion when he had first met
Vanamee herding the sheep. This encompassing detour around the whole
country-side was a favorite pastime of his and he was anxious that
Vanamee should share his pleasure in it.

But soon after leaving Guadalajara, they found themselves upon the land
that Dyke had bought and upon which he was to raise his famous crop of
hops. Dyke's house was close at hand, a very pleasant little cottage,
painted white, with green blinds and deep porches, while near it and yet
in process of construction, were two great storehouses and a drying and
curing house, where the hops were to be stored and treated. All about
were evidences that the former engineer had already been hard at
work. The ground had been put in readiness to receive the crop and a
bewildering, innumerable multitude of poles, connected with a maze of
wire and twine, had been set out. Farther on at a turn of the road, they
came upon Dyke himself, driving a farm wagon loaded with more poles.
He was in his shirt sleeves, his massive, hairy arms bare to the elbow,
glistening with sweat, red with heat. In his bell-like, rumbling voice,
he was calling to his foreman and a boy at work in stringing the poles
together. At sight of Presley and Vanamee he hailed them jovially,
addressing them as “boys,” and insisting that they should get into the
wagon with him and drive to the house for a glass of beer. His mother
had only the day before returned from Marysville, where she had been
looking up a seminary for the little tad. She would be delighted to see
the two boys; besides, Vanamee must see how the little tad had grown
since he last set eyes on her; wouldn't know her for the same little
girl; and the beer had been on ice since morning. Presley and Vanamee
could not well refuse.

They climbed into the wagon and jolted over the uneven ground through
the bare forest of hop-poles to the house. Inside they found Mrs.
Dyke, an old lady with a very gentle face, who wore a cap and a very
old-fashioned gown with hoop skirts, dusting the what-not in a corner of
the parlor. The two men were presented and the beer was had from off the
ice.

“Mother,” said Dyke, as he wiped the froth from his great blond beard,
“ain't Sid anywheres about? I want Mr. Vanamee to see how she has grown.
Smartest little tad in Tulare County, boys. Can recite the whole of
'Snow Bound,' end to end, without skipping or looking at the book. Maybe
you don't believe that. Mother, ain't I right--without skipping a line,
hey?”

Mrs. Dyke nodded to say that it was so, but explained that Sidney was
in Guadalajara. In putting on her new slippers for the first time the
morning before, she had found a dime in the toe of one of them and had
had the whole house by the ears ever since till she could spend it.

“Was it for licorice to make her licorice water?” inquired Dyke gravely.

“Yes,” said Mrs. Dyke. “I made her tell me what she was going to get
before she went, and it was licorice.”

Dyke, though his mother protested that he was foolish and that Presley
and Vanamee had no great interest in “young ones,” insisted upon showing
the visitors Sidney's copy-books. They were monuments of laborious,
elaborate neatness, the trite moralities and ready-made aphorisms of the
philanthropists and publicists, repeated from page to page with wearying
insistence. “I, too, am an American Citizen. S. D.,” “As the Twig is
Bent the Tree is Inclined,” “Truth Crushed to Earth Will Rise Again,”
 “As for Me, Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death,” and last of all, a
strange intrusion amongst the mild, well-worn phrases, two legends. “My
motto--Public Control of Public Franchises,” and “The P. and S. W. is
an Enemy of the State.”

“I see,” commented Presley, “you mean the little tad to understand 'the
situation' early.”

“I told him he was foolish to give that to Sid to copy,” said Mrs.
Dyke, with indulgent remonstrance. “What can she understand of public
franchises?”

“Never mind,” observed Dyke, “she'll remember it when she grows up and
when the seminary people have rubbed her up a bit, and then she'll
begin to ask questions and understand. And don't you make any mistake,
mother,” he went on, “about the little tad not knowing who her dad's
enemies are. What do you think, boys? Listen, here. Precious little I've
ever told her of the railroad or how I was turned off, but the other
day I was working down by the fence next the railroad tracks and Sid was
there. She'd brought her doll rags down and she was playing house behind
a pile of hop poles. Well, along comes a through freight--mixed train
from Missouri points and a string of empties from New Orleans,--and when
it had passed, what do you suppose the tad did? SHE didn't know I was
watching her. She goes to the fence and spits a little spit after the
caboose and puts out her little head and, if you'll believe me, HISSES
at the train; and mother says she does that same every time she sees a
train go by, and never crosses the tracks that she don't spit her little
spit on 'em. What do you THINK of THAT?”

“But I correct her every time,” protested Mrs. Dyke seriously. “Where
she picked up the trick of hissing I don't know. No, it's not funny. It
seems dreadful to see a little girl who's as sweet and gentle as can
be in every other way, so venomous. She says the other little girls at
school and the boys, too, are all the same way. Oh, dear,” she sighed,
“why will the General Office be so unkind and unjust? Why, I couldn't
be happy, with all the money in the world, if I thought that even one
little child hated me--hated me so that it would spit and hiss at me.
And it's not one child, it's all of them, so Sidney says; and think of
all the grown people who hate the road, women and men, the whole county,
the whole State, thousands and thousands of people. Don't the managers
and the directors of the road ever think of that? Don't they ever think
of all the hate that surrounds them, everywhere, everywhere, and the
good people that just grit their teeth when the name of the road is
mentioned? Why do they want to make the people hate them? No,” she
murmured, the tears starting to her eyes, “No, I tell you, Mr. Presley,
the men who own the railroad are wicked, bad-hearted men who don't care
how much the poor people suffer, so long as the road makes its eighteen
million a year. They don't care whether the people hate them or love
them, just so long as they are afraid of them. It's not right and God
will punish them sooner or later.”

A little after this the two young men took themselves away, Dyke
obligingly carrying them in the wagon as far as the gate that opened
into the Quien Sabe ranch. On the way, Presley referred to what Mrs.
Dyke had said and led Dyke, himself, to speak of the P. and S. W.

“Well,” Dyke said, “it's like this, Mr. Presley. I, personally, haven't
got the right to kick. With you wheat-growing people I guess it's
different, but hops, you see, don't count for much in the State. It's
such a little business that the road don't want to bother themselves to
tax it. It's the wheat growers that the road cinches. The rates on hops
ARE FAIR. I've got to admit that; I was in to Bonneville a while ago to
find out. It's two cents a pound, and Lord love you, that's reasonable
enough to suit any man. No,” he concluded, “I'm on the way to make money
now. The road sacking me as they did was, maybe, a good thing for me,
after all. It came just at the right time. I had a bit of money put by
and here was the chance to go into hops with the certainty that hops
would quadruple and quintuple in price inside the year. No, it was my
chance, and though they didn't mean it by a long chalk, the railroad
people did me a good turn when they gave me my time--and the tad'll
enter the seminary next fall.”

About a quarter of an hour after they had said goodbye to the one-time
engineer, Presley and Vanamee, tramping briskly along the road that led
northward through Quien Sabe, arrived at Annixter's ranch house. At once
they were aware of a vast and unwonted bustle that revolved about the
place. They stopped a few moments looking on, amused and interested in
what was going forward.

The colossal barn was finished. Its freshly white-washed sides glared
intolerably in the sun, but its interior was as yet innocent of paint
and through the yawning vent of the sliding doors came a delicious
odour of new, fresh wood and shavings. A crowd of men--Annixter's farm
hands--were swarming all about it. Some were balanced on the topmost
rounds of ladders, hanging festoons of Japanese lanterns from tree
to tree, and all across the front of the barn itself. Mrs. Tree, her
daughter Hilma and another woman were inside the barn cutting into long
strips bolt after bolt of red, white and blue cambric and directing
how these strips should be draped from the ceiling and on the walls;
everywhere resounded the tapping of tack hammers. A farm wagon drove
up loaded to overflowing with evergreens and with great bundles of
palm leaves, and these were immediately seized upon and affixed as
supplementary decorations to the tri-coloured cambric upon the inside
walls of the barn. Two of the larger evergreen trees were placed on
either side the barn door and their tops bent over to form an arch. In
the middle of this arch it was proposed to hang a mammoth pasteboard
escutcheon with gold letters, spelling the word WELCOME. Piles of
chairs, rented from I.O.O.F. hall in Bonneville, heaped themselves in
an apparently hopeless entanglement on the ground; while at the far
extremity of the barn a couple of carpenters clattered about the
impromptu staging which was to accommodate the band.

There was a strenuous gayety in the air; everybody was in the best of
spirits. Notes of laughter continually interrupted the conversation
on every hand. At every moment a group of men involved themselves in
uproarious horse-play. They passed oblique jokes behind their hands
to each other--grossly veiled double-meanings meant for the women--and
bellowed with laughter thereat, stamping on the ground. The relations
between the sexes grew more intimate, the women and girls pushing the
young fellows away from their sides with vigorous thrusts of their
elbows. It was passed from group to group that Adela Vacca, a division
superintendent's wife, had lost her garter; the daughter of the foreman
of the Home ranch was kissed behind the door of the dairy-house.

Annixter, in execrable temper, appeared from time to time, hatless, his
stiff yellow hair in wild disorder. He hurried between the barn and the
ranch house, carrying now a wickered demijohn, now a case of wine, now
a basket of lemons and pineapples. Besides general supervision, he had
elected to assume the responsibility of composing the punch--something
stiff, by jingo, a punch that would raise you right out of your boots; a
regular hairlifter.

The harness room of the barn he had set apart for: himself and
intimates. He had brought a long table down from the house and upon
it had set out boxes of cigars, bottles of whiskey and of beer and
the great china bowls for the punch. It would be no fault of his, he
declared, if half the number of his men friends were not uproarious
before they left. His barn dance would be the talk of all Tulare County
for years to come. For this one day he had resolved to put all thoughts
of business out of his head. For the matter of that, things were going
well enough. Osterman was back from Los Angeles with a favourable
report as to his affair with Disbrow and Darrell. There had been another
meeting of the committee. Harran Derrick had attended. Though he had
taken no part in the discussion, Annixter was satisfied. The Governor
had consented to allow Harran to “come in,” if he so desired, and
Harran had pledged himself to share one-sixth of the campaign expenses,
providing these did not exceed a certain figure.

As Annixter came to the door of the barn to shout abuse at the
distraught Chinese cook who was cutting up lemons in the kitchen, he
caught sight of Presley and Vanamee and hailed them.

“Hello, Pres,” he called. “Come over here and see how she looks;” he
indicated the barn with a movement of his head. “Well, we're getting
ready for you tonight,” he went on as the two friends came up. “But
how we are going to get straightened out by eight o'clock I don't know.
Would you believe that pip Caraher is short of lemons--at this last
minute and I told him I'd want three cases of 'em as much as a month
ago, and here, just when I want a good lively saddle horse to get around
on, somebody hikes the buckskin out the corral. STOLE her, by jingo.
I'll have the law on that thief if it breaks me--and a sixty-dollar
saddle 'n' head-stall gone with her; and only about half the number of
Jap lanterns that I ordered have shown up and not candles enough for
those. It's enough to make a dog sick. There's nothing done that you
don't do yourself, unless you stand over these loafers with a club. I'm
sick of the whole business--and I've lost my hat; wish to God I'd never
dreamed of givin' this rotten fool dance. Clutter the whole place up
with a lot of feemales. I sure did lose my presence of mind when I got
THAT idea.”

Then, ignoring the fact that it was he, himself, who had called the
young men to him, he added:

“Well, this is my busy day. Sorry I can't stop and talk to you longer.”

He shouted a last imprecation at the Chinaman and turned back into the
barn. Presley and Vanamee went on, but Annixter, as he crossed the floor
of the barn, all but collided with Hilma Tree, who came out from one of
the stalls, a box of candles in her arms.

Gasping out an apology, Annixter reentered the harness room, closing the
door behind him, and forgetting all the responsibility of the moment,
lit a cigar and sat down in one of the hired chairs, his hands in his
pockets, his feet on the table, frowning thoughtfully through the blue
smoke.

Annixter was at last driven to confess to himself that he could not get
the thought of Hilma Tree out of his mind. Finally she had “got a hold
on him.” The thing that of all others he most dreaded had happened. A
feemale girl had got a hold on him, and now there was no longer for him
any such thing as peace of mind. The idea of the young woman was with
him continually. He went to bed with it; he got up with it. At every
moment of the day he was pestered with it. It interfered with his work,
got mixed up in his business. What a miserable confession for a man to
make; a fine way to waste his time. Was it possible that only the other
day he had stood in front of the music store in Bonneville and seriously
considered making Hilma a present of a music-box? Even now, the very
thought of it made him flush with shame, and this after she had told
him plainly that she did not like him. He was running after her--he,
Annixter! He ripped out a furious oath, striking the table with his boot
heel. Again and again he had resolved to put the whole affair from out
his mind. Once he had been able to do so, but of late it was becoming
harder and harder with every successive day. He had only to close his
eyes to see her as plain as if she stood before him; he saw her in a
glory of sunlight that set a fine tinted lustre of pale carnation and
gold on the silken sheen of her white skin, her hair sparkled with it,
her thick, strong neck, sloping to her shoulders with beautiful, full
curves, seemed to radiate the light; her eyes, brown, wide, innocent
in expression, disclosing the full disc of the pupil upon the slightest
provocation, flashed in this sunlight like diamonds.

Annixter was all bewildered. With the exception of the timid little
creature in the glove-cleaning establishment in Sacramento, he had had
no acquaintance with any woman. His world was harsh, crude, a world of
men only--men who were to be combatted, opposed--his hand was against
nearly every one of them. Women he distrusted with the instinctive
distrust of the overgrown schoolboy. Now, at length, a young woman had
come into his life. Promptly he was struck with discomfiture, annoyed
almost beyond endurance, harassed, bedevilled, excited, made angry and
exasperated. He was suspicious of the woman, yet desired her, totally
ignorant of how to approach her, hating the sex, yet drawn to the
individual, confusing the two emotions, sometimes even hating Hilma as
a result of this confusion, but at all times disturbed, vexed, irritated
beyond power of expression.

At length, Annixter cast his cigar from him and plunged again into the
work of the day. The afternoon wore to evening, to the accompaniment
of wearying and clamorous endeavour. In some unexplained fashion,
the labour of putting the great barn in readiness for the dance was
accomplished; the last bolt of cambric was hung in place from the
rafters. The last evergreen tree was nailed to the joists of the
walls; the last lantern hung, the last nail driven into the musicians'
platform. The sun set. There was a great scurry to have supper and
dress. Annixter, last of all the other workers, left the barn in the
dusk of twilight. He was alone; he had a saw under one arm, a bag of
tools was in his hand. He was in his shirt sleeves and carried his coat
over his shoulder; a hammer was thrust into one of his hip pockets. He
was in execrable temper. The day's work had fagged him out. He had not
been able to find his hat.

“And the buckskin with sixty dollars' worth of saddle gone, too,” he
groaned. “Oh, ain't it sweet?”

At his house, Mrs. Tree had set out a cold supper for him, the
inevitable dish of prunes serving as dessert. After supper Annixter
bathed and dressed. He decided at the last moment to wear his usual
town-going suit, a sack suit of black, made by a Bonneville tailor. But
his hat was gone. There were other hats he might have worn, but because
this particular one was lost he fretted about it all through his
dressing and then decided to have one more look around the barn for it.

For over a quarter of an hour he pottered about the barn, going from
stall to stall, rummaging the harness room and feed room, all to no
purpose. At last he came out again upon the main floor, definitely
giving up the search, looking about him to see if everything was in
order.

The festoons of Japanese lanterns in and around the barn were not yet
lighted, but some half-dozen lamps, with great, tin reflectors, that
hung against the walls, were burning low. A dull half light pervaded the
vast interior, hollow, echoing, leaving the corners and roof thick with
impenetrable black shadows. The barn faced the west and through the open
sliding doors was streaming a single bright bar from the after-glow,
incongruous and out of all harmony with the dull flare of the kerosene
lamps.

As Annixter glanced about him, he saw a figure step briskly out of the
shadows of one corner of the building, pause for the fraction of one
instant in the bar of light, then, at sight of him, dart back again.
There was a sound of hurried footsteps.

Annixter, with recollections of the stolen buckskin in his mind, cried
out sharply:

“Who's there?”

There was no answer. In a second his pistol was in his hand.

“Who's there? Quick, speak up or I'll shoot.”

“No, no, no, don't shoot,” cried an answering voice. “Oh, be careful.
It's I--Hilma Tree.”

Annixter slid the pistol into his pocket with a great qualm of
apprehension. He came forward and met Hilma in the doorway.

“Good Lord,” he murmured, “that sure did give me a start. If I HAD
shot----”

Hilma stood abashed and confused before him. She was dressed in a white
organdie frock of the most rigorous simplicity and wore neither flower
nor ornament. The severity of her dress made her look even larger than
usual, and even as it was her eyes were on a level with Annixter's.
There was a certain fascination in the contradiction of stature and
character of Hilma--a great girl, half-child as yet, but tall as a man
for all that.

There was a moment's awkward silence, then Hilma explained:

“I--I came back to look for my hat. I thought I left it here this
afternoon.”

“And I was looking for my hat,” cried Annixter. “Funny enough, hey?”

They laughed at this as heartily as children might have done. The
constraint of the situation was a little relaxed and Annixter, with
sudden directness, glanced sharply at the young woman and demanded:

“Well, Miss Hilma, hate me as much as ever?”

“Oh, no, sir,” she answered, “I never said I hated you.”

“Well,--dislike me, then; I know you said that.”

“I--I disliked what you did--TRIED to do. It made me angry and it hurt
me. I shouldn't have said what I did that time, but it was your fault.”

“You mean you shouldn't have said you didn't like me?” asked Annixter.
“Why?”

“Well, well,--I don't--I don't DISlike anybody,” admitted Hilma.

“Then I can take it that you don't dislike ME? Is that it?”

“I don't dislike anybody,” persisted Hilma.

“Well, I asked you more than that, didn't I?” queried Annixter uneasily.
“I asked you to like me, remember, the other day. I'm asking you that
again, now. I want you to like me.”

Hilma lifted her eyes inquiringly to his. In her words was an
unmistakable ring of absolute sincerity. Innocently she inquired:

“Why?”

Annixter was struck speechless. In the face of such candour, such
perfect ingenuousness, he was at a loss for any words.

“Well--well,” he stammered, “well--I don't know,” he suddenly burst out.
“That is,” he went on, groping for his wits, “I can't quite say why.”
 The idea of a colossal lie occurred to him, a thing actually royal.

“I like to have the people who are around me like me,” he declared.
“I--I like to be popular, understand? Yes, that's it,” he continued,
more reassured. “I don't like the idea of any one disliking me. That's
the way I am. It's my nature.”

“Oh, then,” returned Hilma, “you needn't bother. No, I don't dislike
you.”

“Well, that's good,” declared Annixter judicially. “That's good. But
hold on,” he interrupted, “I'm forgetting. It's not enough to not
dislike me. I want you to like me. How about THAT?”

Hilma paused for a moment, glancing vaguely out of the doorway toward
the lighted window of the dairy-house, her head tilted.

“I don't know that I ever thought about that,” she said.

“Well, think about it now,” insisted Annixter.

“But I never thought about liking anybody particularly,” she observed.
“It's because I like everybody, don't you see?”

“Well, you've got to like some people more than other people,” hazarded
Annixter, “and I want to be one of those 'some people,' savvy? Good
Lord, I don't know how to say these fool things. I talk like a galoot
when I get talking to feemale girls and I can't lay my tongue to
anything that sounds right. It isn't my nature. And look here, I lied
when I said I liked to have people like me--to be popular. Rot! I don't
care a curse about people's opinions of me. But there's a few
people that are more to me than most others--that chap Presley, for
instance--and those people I DO want to have like me. What they think
counts. Pshaw! I know I've got enemies; piles of them. I could name you
half a dozen men right now that are naturally itching to take a shot at
me. How about this ranch? Don't I know, can't I hear the men growling
oaths under their breath after I've gone by? And in business ways, too,”
 he went on, speaking half to himself, “in Bonneville and all over the
county there's not a man of them wouldn't howl for joy if they got a
chance to down Buck Annixter. Think I care? Why, I LIKE it. I run my
ranch to suit myself and I play my game my own way. I'm a 'driver,'
I know it, and a 'bully,' too. Oh, I know what they call me--'a brute
beast, with a twist in my temper that would rile up a new-born lamb,'
and I'm 'crusty' and 'pig-headed' and 'obstinate.' They say all that,
but they've got to say, too, that I'm cleverer than any man-jack in the
running. There's nobody can get ahead of me.” His eyes snapped. “Let 'em
grind their teeth. They can't 'down' me. When I shut my fist there's
not one of them can open it. No, not with a CHISEL.” He turned to Hilma
again. “Well, when a man's hated as much as that, it stands to reason,
don't it, Miss Hilma, that the few friends he has got he wants to keep?
I'm not such an entire swine to the people that know me best--that
jackass, Presley, for instance. I'd put my hand in the fire to do him
a real service. Sometimes I get kind of lonesome; wonder if you would
understand? It's my fault, but there's not a horse about the place that
don't lay his ears back when I get on him; there's not a dog don't put
his tail between his legs as soon as I come near him. The cayuse isn't
foaled yet here on Quien Sabe that can throw me, nor the dog whelped
that would dare show his teeth at me. I kick that Irish setter every
time I see him--but wonder what I'd do, though, if he didn't slink so
much, if he wagged his tail and was glad to see me? So it all comes to
this: I'd like to have you--well, sort of feel that I was a good friend
of yours and like me because of it.”

The flame in the lamp on the wall in front of Hilma stretched upward
tall and thin and began to smoke. She went over to where the lamp hung
and, standing on tip-toe, lowered the wick. As she reached her hand
up, Annixter noted how the sombre, lurid red of the lamp made a warm
reflection on her smooth, round arm.

“Do you understand?” he queried.

“Yes, why, yes,” she answered, turning around. “It's very good of you to
want to be a friend of mine. I didn't think so, though, when you tried
to kiss me. But maybe it's all right since you've explained things. You
see I'm different from you. I like everybody to like me and I like to
like everybody. It makes one so much happier. You wouldn't believe it,
but you ought to try it, sir, just to see. It's so good to be good to
people and to have people good to you. And everybody has always been
so good to me. Mamma and papa, of course, and Billy, the stableman, and
Montalegre, the Portugee foreman, and the Chinese cook, even, and Mr.
Delaney--only he went away--and Mrs. Vacca and her little----”

“Delaney, hey?” demanded Annixter abruptly. “You and he were pretty good
friends, were you?”

“Oh, yes,” she answered. “He was just as GOOD to me. Every day in the
summer time he used to ride over to the Seed ranch back of the Mission
and bring me a great armful of flowers, the prettiest things, and I used
to pretend to pay him for them with dollars made of cheese that I cut
out of the cheese with a biscuit cutter. It was such fun. We were the
best of friends.”

“There's another lamp smoking,” growled Annixter. “Turn it down, will
you?--and see that somebody sweeps this floor here. It's all littered up
with pine needles. I've got a lot to do. Good-bye.”

“Good-bye, sir.”

Annixter returned to the ranch house, his teeth clenched, enraged, his
face flushed.

“Ah,” he muttered, “Delaney, hey? Throwing it up to me that I fired
him.” His teeth gripped together more fiercely than ever. “The best
of friends, hey? By God, I'll have that girl yet. I'll show that
cow-puncher. Ain't I her employer, her boss? I'll show her--and Delaney,
too. It would be easy enough--and then Delaney can have her--if he wants
her--after me.”

An evil light flashing from under his scowl, spread over his face. The
male instincts of possession, unreasoned, treacherous, oblique, came
twisting to the surface. All the lower nature of the man, ignorant of
women, racked at one and the same time with enmity and desire, roused
itself like a hideous and abominable beast. And at the same moment,
Hilma returned to her house, humming to herself as she walked, her white
dress glowing with a shimmer of faint saffron light in the last ray of
the after-glow.

A little after half-past seven, the first carry-all, bearing the
druggist of Bonneville and his women-folk, arrived in front of the new
barn. Immediately afterward an express wagon loaded down with a
swarming family of Spanish-Mexicans, gorgeous in red and yellow colours,
followed. Billy, the stableman, and his assistant took charge of the
teams, unchecking the horses and hitching them to a fence back of the
barn. Then Caraher, the saloon-keeper, in “derby” hat, “Prince Albert”
 coat, pointed yellow shoes and inevitable red necktie, drove into the
yard on his buckboard, the delayed box of lemons under the seat. It
looked as if the whole array of invited guests was to arrive in one
unbroken procession, but for a long half-hour nobody else appeared.
Annixter and Caraher withdrew to the harness room and promptly involved
themselves in a wrangle as to the make-up of the famous punch. From time
to time their voices could be heard uplifted in clamorous argument.

“Two quarts and a half and a cupful of chartreuse.”

“Rot, rot, I know better. Champagne straight and a dash of brandy.”

The druggist's wife and sister retired to the feed room, where a bureau
with a swinging mirror had been placed for the convenience of the women.
The druggist stood awkwardly outside the door of the feed room, his coat
collar turned up against the draughts that drifted through the barn, his
face troubled, debating anxiously as to the propriety of putting on his
gloves. The Spanish-Mexican family, a father, mother and five children
and sister-in-law, sat rigid on the edges of the hired chairs, silent,
constrained, their eyes lowered, their elbows in at their sides,
glancing furtively from under their eyebrows at the decorations or
watching with intense absorption young Vacca, son of one of the division
superintendents, who wore a checked coat and white thread gloves and
who paced up and down the length of the barn, frowning, very important,
whittling a wax candle over the floor to make it slippery for dancing.

The musicians arrived, the City Band of Bonneville--Annixter having
managed to offend the leader of the “Dirigo” Club orchestra, at the very
last moment, to such a point that he had refused his services. These
members of the City Band repaired at once to their platform in the
corner. At every instant they laughed uproariously among themselves,
joshing one of their number, a Frenchman, whom they called “Skeezicks.”
 Their hilarity reverberated in a hollow, metallic roll among the rafters
overhead. The druggist observed to young Vacca as he passed by that he
thought them pretty fresh, just the same.

“I'm busy, I'm very busy,” returned the young man, continuing on his
way, still frowning and paring the stump of candle.

“Two quarts 'n' a half. Two quarts 'n' a half.”

“Ah, yes, in a way, that's so; and then, again, in a way, it ISN'T. I
know better.”

All along one side of the barn were a row of stalls, fourteen of them,
clean as yet, redolent of new cut wood, the sawdust still in the cracks
of the flooring. Deliberately the druggist went from one to the other,
pausing contemplatively before each. He returned down the line and again
took up his position by the door of the feed room, nodding his head
judicially, as if satisfied. He decided to put on his gloves.

By now it was quite dark. Outside, between the barn and the ranch houses
one could see a group of men on step-ladders lighting the festoons of
Japanese lanterns. In the darkness, only their faces appeared here and
there, high above the ground, seen in a haze of red, strange, grotesque.
Gradually as the multitude of lanterns were lit, the light spread.
The grass underfoot looked like green excelsior. Another group of men
invaded the barn itself, lighting the lamps and lanterns there. Soon
the whole place was gleaming with points of light. Young Vacca, who had
disappeared, returned with his pockets full of wax candles. He resumed
his whittling, refusing to answer any questions, vociferating that he
was busy.

Outside there was a sound of hoofs and voices. More guests had arrived.
The druggist, seized with confusion, terrified lest he had put on his
gloves too soon, thrust his hands into his pockets. It was Cutter,
Magnus Derrick's division superintendent, who came, bringing his wife
and her two girl cousins. They had come fifteen miles by the trail from
the far distant division house on “Four” of Los Muertos and had ridden
on horseback instead of driving. Mrs. Cutter could be heard declaring
that she was nearly dead and felt more like going to bed than dancing.
The two girl cousins, in dresses of dotted Swiss over blue sateen, were
doing their utmost to pacify her. She could be heard protesting from
moment to moment. One distinguished the phrases “straight to my bed,”
 “back nearly broken in two,” “never wanted to come in the first place.”
 The druggist, observing Cutter take a pair of gloves from Mrs. Cutter's
reticule, drew his hands from his pockets.

But abruptly there was an interruption. In the musicians' corner
a scuffle broke out. A chair was overturned. There was a noise of
imprecations mingled with shouts of derision. Skeezicks, the Frenchman,
had turned upon the joshers.

“Ah, no,” he was heard to exclaim, “at the end of the end it is too
much. Kind of a bad canary--we will go to see about that. Aha, let him
close up his face before I demolish it with a good stroke of the fist.”

The men who were lighting the lanterns were obliged to intervene before
he could be placated.

Hooven and his wife and daughters arrived. Minna was carrying little
Hilda, already asleep, in her arms. Minna looked very pretty, striking
even, with her black hair, pale face, very red lips and greenish-blue
eyes. She was dressed in what had been Mrs. Hooven's wedding gown, a
cheap affair of “farmer's satin.” Mrs. Hooven had pendent earrings
of imitation jet in her ears. Hooven was wearing an old frock coat of
Magnus Derrick's, the sleeves too long, the shoulders absurdly too wide.
He and Cutter at once entered into an excited conversation as to the
ownership of a certain steer.

“Why, the brand----”

“Ach, Gott, der brendt,” Hooven clasped his head, “ach, der brendt, dot
maks me laugh some laughs. Dot's goot--der brendt--doand I see um--shoor
der boole mit der bleck star bei der vore-head in der middle oaf. Any
someones you esk tell you dot is mein boole. You esk any someones. Der
brendt? To hell mit der brendt. You aindt got some memorie aboudt does
ting I guess nodt.”

“Please step aside, gentlemen,” said young Vacca, who was still making
the rounds of the floor.

Hooven whirled about. “Eh? What den,” he exclaimed, still excited,
willing to be angry at any one for the moment. “Doand you push soh, you.
I tink berhapz you doand OWN dose barn, hey?”

“I'm busy, I'm very busy.” The young man pushed by with grave
preoccupation.

“Two quarts 'n' a half. Two quarts 'n' a half.”

“I know better. That's all rot.”

But the barn was filling up rapidly. At every moment there was a rattle
of a newly arrived vehicle from outside. Guest after guest appeared
in the doorway, singly or in couples, or in families, or in garrulous
parties of five and six. Now it was Phelps and his mother from Los
Muertos, now a foreman from Broderson's with his family, now a gayly
apparelled clerk from a Bonneville store, solitary and bewildered,
looking for a place to put his hat, now a couple of Spanish-Mexican
girls from Guadalajara with coquettish effects of black and yellow about
their dress, now a group of Osterman's tenants, Portuguese, swarthy,
with plastered hair and curled mustaches, redolent of cheap perfumes.
Sarria arrived, his smooth, shiny face glistening with perspiration. He
wore a new cassock and carried his broad-brimmed hat under his arm. His
appearance made quite a stir. He passed from group to group, urbane,
affable, shaking hands right and left; he assumed a set smile of
amiability which never left his face the whole evening.

But abruptly there was a veritable sensation. From out the little crowd
that persistently huddled about the doorway came Osterman. He wore
a dress-suit with a white waistcoat and patent leather pumps--what
a wonder! A little qualm of excitement spread around the barn. One
exchanged nudges of the elbow with one's neighbour, whispering earnestly
behind the hand. What astonishing clothes! Catch on to the coat-tails!
It was a masquerade costume, maybe; that goat Osterman was such a
josher, one never could tell what he would do next.

The musicians began to tune up. From their corner came a medley of
mellow sounds, the subdued chirps of the violins, the dull bourdon of
the bass viol, the liquid gurgling of the flageolet and the deep-toned
snarl of the big horn, with now and then a rasping stridulating of the
snare drum. A sense of gayety began to spread throughout the assembly.
At every moment the crowd increased. The aroma of new-sawn timber
and sawdust began to be mingled with the feminine odour of sachet and
flowers. There was a babel of talk in the air--male baritone and soprano
chatter--varied by an occasional note of laughter and the swish of
stiffly starched petticoats. On the row of chairs that went around three
sides of the wall groups began to settle themselves. For a long time
the guests huddled close to the doorway; the lower end of the floor
was crowded! the upper end deserted; but by degrees the lines of white
muslin and pink and blue sateen extended, dotted with the darker figures
of men in black suits. The conversation grew louder as the timidity of
the early moments wore off. Groups at a distance called back and forth;
conversations were carried on at top voice. Once, even a whole party
hurried across the floor from one side of the barn to the other.

Annixter emerged from the harness room, his face red with wrangling. He
took a position to the right of the door, shaking hands with newcomers,
inviting them over and over again to cut loose and whoop it along. Into
the ears of his more intimate male acquaintances he dropped a word as
to punch and cigars in the harness room later on, winking with vast
intelligence. Ranchers from remoter parts of the country appeared:
Garnett, from the Ruby rancho, Keast, from the ranch of the same name,
Gethings, of the San Pablo, Chattern, of the Bonanza, and others and
still others, a score of them--elderly men, for the most part, bearded,
slow of speech, deliberate, dressed in broadcloth. Old Broderson, who
entered with his wife on his arm, fell in with this type, and with them
came a certain Dabney, of whom nothing but his name was known, a silent
old man, who made no friends, whom nobody knew or spoke to, who was seen
only upon such occasions as this, coming from no one knew where, going,
no one cared to inquire whither.

Between eight and half-past, Magnus Derrick and his family were seen.
Magnus's entry caused no little impression. Some said: “There's the
Governor,” and called their companions' attention to the thin,
erect figure, commanding, imposing, dominating all in his immediate
neighbourhood. Harran came with him, wearing a cut-away suit of black.
He was undeniably handsome, young and fresh looking, his cheeks highly
coloured, quite the finest looking of all the younger men; blond,
strong, with that certain courtliness of manner that had always made him
liked. He took his mother upon his arm and conducted her to a seat by
the side of Mrs. Broderson.

Annie Derrick was very pretty that evening. She was dressed in a grey
silk gown with a collar of pink velvet. Her light brown hair that yet
retained so much of its brightness was transfixed by a high, shell comb,
very Spanish. But the look of uneasiness in her large eyes--the eyes of
a young girl--was deepening every day. The expression of innocence
and inquiry which they so easily assumed, was disturbed by a faint
suggestion of aversion, almost of terror. She settled herself in her
place, in the corner of the hall, in the rear rank of chairs, a little
frightened by the glare of lights, the hum of talk and the shifting
crowd, glad to be out of the way, to attract no attention, willing to
obliterate herself.

All at once Annixter, who had just shaken hands with Dyke, his mother
and the little tad, moved abruptly in his place, drawing in his breath
sharply. The crowd around the great, wide-open main door of the barn had
somewhat thinned out and in the few groups that still remained there he
had suddenly recognised Mr. and Mrs. Tree and Hilma, making their way
towards some empty seats near the entrance of the feed room.

In the dusky light of the barn earlier in the evening, Annixter had not
been able to see Hilma plainly. Now, however, as she passed before his
eyes in the glittering radiance of the lamps and lanterns, he caught
his breath in astonishment. Never had she appeared more beautiful in his
eyes. It did not seem possible that this was the same girl whom he saw
every day in and around the ranch house and dairy, the girl of simple
calico frocks and plain shirt waists, who brought him his dinner, who
made up his bed. Now he could not take his eyes from her. Hilma, for
the first time, was wearing her hair done high upon her head. The thick,
sweet-smelling masses, bitumen brown in the shadows, corruscated like
golden filaments in the light. Her organdie frock was long, longer than
any she had yet worn. It left a little of her neck and breast bare and
all of her arm.

Annixter muttered an exclamation. Such arms! How did she manage to
keep them hid on ordinary occasions. Big at the shoulder, tapering with
delicious modulations to the elbow and wrist, overlaid with a delicate,
gleaming lustre. As often as she turned her head the movement sent
a slow undulation over her neck and shoulders, the pale amber-tinted
shadows under her chin, coming and going over the creamy whiteness of
the skin like the changing moire of silk. The pretty rose colour of
her cheek had deepened to a pale carnation. Annixter, his hands clasped
behind him, stood watching.

In a few moments Hilma was surrounded by a group of young men,
clamouring for dances. They came from all corners of the barn, leaving
the other girls precipitately, almost rudely. There could be little
doubt as to who was to be the belle of the occasion. Hilma's little
triumph was immediate, complete. Annixter could hear her voice from time
to time, its usual velvety huskiness vibrating to a note of exuberant
gayety.

All at once the orchestra swung off into a march--the Grand March. There
was a great rush to secure “partners.” Young Vacca, still going the
rounds, was pushed to one side. The gayly apparelled clerk from the
Bonneville store lost his head in the confusion. He could not find
his “partner.” He roamed wildly about the barn, bewildered, his eyes
rolling. He resolved to prepare an elaborate programme card on the
back of an old envelope. Rapidly the line was formed, Hilma and Harran
Derrick in the lead, Annixter having obstinately refused to engage
in either march, set or dance the whole evening. Soon the confused
shuffling of feet settled to a measured cadence; the orchestra blared
and wailed, the snare drum, rolling at exact intervals, the cornet
marking the time. It was half-past eight o'clock.

Annixter drew a long breath:

“Good,” he muttered, “the thing is under way at last.”

Singularly enough, Osterman also refused to dance. The week before
he had returned from Los Angeles, bursting with the importance of his
mission. He had been successful. He had Disbrow “in his pocket.” He
was impatient to pose before the others of the committee as a skilful
political agent, a manipulator. He forgot his attitude of the early part
of the evening when he had drawn attention to himself with his wonderful
clothes. Now his comic actor's face, with its brownish-red cheeks,
protuberant ears and horizontal slit of a mouth, was overcast
with gravity. His bald forehead was seamed with the wrinkles of
responsibility. He drew Annixter into one of the empty stalls and began
an elaborate explanation, glib, voluble, interminable, going over again
in detail what he had reported to the committee in outline.

“I managed--I schemed--I kept dark--I lay low----”

But Annixter refused to listen.

“Oh, rot your schemes. There's a punch in the harness room that will
make the hair grow on the top of your head in the place where the hair
ought to grow. Come on, we'll round up some of the boys and walk into
it.”

They edged their way around the hall outside “The Grand March,” toward
the harness room, picking up on their way Caraher, Dyke, Hooven and old
Broderson. Once in the harness room, Annixter shot the bolt.

“That affair outside,” he observed, “will take care of itself, but
here's a little orphan child that gets lonesome without company.”

Annixter began ladling the punch, filling the glasses.

Osterman proposed a toast to Quien Sabe and the Biggest Barn. Their
elbows crooked in silence. Old Broderson set down his glass, wiping his
long beard and remarking:

“That--that certainly is very--very agreeable. I remember a punch I
drank on Christmas day in '83, or no, it was '84--anyhow, that punch--it
was in Ukiah--'TWAS '83--” He wandered on aimlessly, unable to stop
his flow of speech, losing himself in details, involving his talk in a
hopeless maze of trivialities to which nobody paid any attention.

“I don't drink myself,” observed Dyke, “but just a taste of that with
a lot of water wouldn't be bad for the little tad. She'd think it was
lemonade.” He was about to mix a glass for Sidney, but thought better of
it at the last moment.

“It's the chartreuse that's lacking,” commented Caraher, lowering at
Annixter. The other flared up on the instant.

“Rot, rot. I know better. In some punches it goes; and then, again, in
others it don't.”

But it was left to Hooven to launch the successful phrase:

“Gesundheit,” he exclaimed, holding out his second glass. After
drinking, he replaced it on the table with a long breath. “Ach Gott!”
 he cried, “dat poonsch, say I tink dot poonsch mek some demn goot
vertilizer, hey?”

Fertiliser! The others roared with laughter.

“Good eye, Bismarck,” commented Annixter. The name had a great success.
Thereafter throughout the evening the punch was invariably spoken of as
the “Fertiliser.” Osterman, having spilt the bottom of a glassful on
the floor, pretended that he saw shoots of grain coming up on the spot.
Suddenly he turned upon old Broderson. “I'm bald, ain't I? Want to know
how I lost my hair? Promise you won't ask a single other question and
I'll tell you. Promise your word of honour.”

“Eh? What--wh--I--I don't understand. Your hair? Yes, I'll promise. How
did you lose it?”

“It was bit off.”

The other gazed at him stupefied; his jaw dropped. The company shouted,
and old Broderson, believing he had somehow accomplished a witticism,
chuckled in his beard, wagging his head. But suddenly he fell grave,
struck with an idea. He demanded:

“Yes--I know--but--but what bit it off?”

“Ah,” vociferated Osterman, “that's JUST what you promised not to ask.”

The company doubled up with hilarity. Caraher leaned against the door,
holding his sides, but Hooven, all abroad, unable to follow, gazed from
face to face with a vacant grin, thinking it was still a question of his
famous phrase.

“Vertilizer, hey? Dots some fine joke, hey? You bedt.”

What with the noise of their talk and laughter, it was some time before
Dyke, first of all, heard a persistent knocking on the bolted door. He
called Annixter's attention to the sound. Cursing the intruder, Annixter
unbolted and opened the door. But at once his manner changed.

“Hello. It's Presley. Come in, come in, Pres.”

There was a shout of welcome from the others. A spirit of effusive
cordiality had begun to dominate the gathering. Annixter caught sight of
Vanamee back of Presley, and waiving for the moment the distinction of
employer and employee, insisted that both the friends should come in.

“Any friend of Pres is my friend,” he declared.

But when the two had entered and had exchanged greetings, Presley drew
Annixter aside.

“Vanamee and I have just come from Bonneville,” he explained. “We saw
Delaney there. He's got the buckskin, and he's full of bad whiskey and
dago-red. You should see him; he's wearing all his cow-punching outfit,
hair trousers, sombrero, spurs and all the rest of it, and he has
strapped himself to a big revolver. He says he wasn't invited to your
barn dance but that he's coming over to shoot up the place. He says you
promised to show him off Quien Sabe at the toe of your boot and that
he's going to give you the chance to-night!” “Ah,” commented Annixter,
nodding his head, “he is, is he?”

Presley was disappointed. Knowing Annixter's irascibility, he had
expected to produce a more dramatic effect. He began to explain the
danger of the business. Delaney had once knifed a greaser in the
Panamint country. He was known as a “bad” man. But Annixter refused to
be drawn.

“All right,” he said, “that's all right. Don't tell anybody else. You
might scare the girls off. Get in and drink.”

Outside the dancing was by this time in full swing. The orchestra
was playing a polka. Young Vacca, now at his fiftieth wax candle, had
brought the floor to the slippery surface of glass. The druggist was
dancing with one of the Spanish-Mexican girls with the solemnity of an
automaton, turning about and about, always in the same direction, his
eyes glassy, his teeth set. Hilma Tree was dancing for the second time
with Harran Derrick. She danced with infinite grace. Her cheeks were
bright red, her eyes half-closed, and through her parted lips she drew
from time to time a long, tremulous breath of pure delight. The music,
the weaving colours, the heat of the air, by now a little oppressive,
the monotony of repeated sensation, even the pain of physical fatigue
had exalted all her senses. She was in a dreamy lethargy of happiness.
It was her “first ball.” She could have danced without stopping until
morning. Minna Hooven and Cutter were “promenading.” Mrs. Hooven, with
little Hilda already asleep on her knees, never took her eyes from
her daughter's gown. As often as Minna passed near her she vented an
energetic “pst! pst!” The metal tip of a white draw string was showing
from underneath the waist of Minna's dress. Mrs. Hooven was on the point
of tears.

The solitary gayly apparelled clerk from Bonneville was in a fever of
agitation. He had lost his elaborate programme card. Bewildered, beside
himself with trepidation, he hurried about the room, jostled by the
dancing couples, tripping over the feet of those who were seated;
he peered distressfully under the chairs and about the floor, asking
anxious questions.

Magnus Derrick, the centre of a listening circle of ranchers--Garnett
from the Ruby rancho, Keast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings
and Chattern of the San Pablo and Bonanza--stood near the great open
doorway of the barn, discussing the possibility of a shortage in the
world's wheat crop for the next year.

Abruptly the orchestra ceased playing with a roll of the snare drum, a
flourish of the cornet and a prolonged growl of the bass viol. The
dance broke up, the couples hurrying to their seats, leaving the gayly
apparelled clerk suddenly isolated in the middle of the floor, rolling
his eyes. The druggist released the Spanish-Mexican girl with mechanical
precision out amidst the crowd of dancers. He bowed, dropping his chin
upon his cravat; throughout the dance neither had hazarded a word.
The girl found her way alone to a chair, but the druggist, sick from
continually revolving in the same direction, walked unsteadily toward
the wall. All at once the barn reeled around him; he fell down. There
was a great laugh, but he scrambled to his feet and disappeared abruptly
out into the night through the doorway of the barn, deathly pale, his
hand upon his stomach.

Dabney, the old man whom nobody knew, approached the group of ranchers
around Magnus Derrick and stood, a little removed, listening gravely
to what the governor was saying, his chin sunk in his collar, silent,
offering no opinions.

But the leader of the orchestra, with a great gesture of his violin bow,
cried out:

“All take partners for the lancers and promenade around the hall!”

However, there was a delay. A little crowd formed around the musicians'
platform; voices were raised; there was a commotion. Skeezicks, who
played the big horn, accused the cornet and the snare-drum of stealing
his cold lunch. At intervals he could be heard expostulating:

“Ah, no! at the end of the end! Render me the sausages, you, or less I
break your throat! Aha! I know you. You are going to play me there a
bad farce. My sausages and the pork sandwich, else I go away from this
place!”

He made an exaggerated show of replacing his big horn in its case, but
the by-standers raised a great protest. The sandwiches and one sausage
were produced; the other had disappeared. In the end Skeezichs allowed
himself to be appeased. The dance was resumed.

Half an hour later the gathering in the harness room was considerably
reinforced. It was the corner of the barn toward which the male guests
naturally gravitated. Harran Derrick, who only cared to dance with Hilma
Tree, was admitted. Garnett from the Ruby rancho and Gethings from
the San Pablo, came in a little afterwards. A fourth bowl of punch was
mixed, Annixter and Caraher clamouring into each other's face as to its
ingredients. Cigars were lighted. Soon the air of the room became blue
with an acrid haze of smoke. It was very warm. Ranged in their chairs
around the side of the room, the guests emptied glass after glass.

Vanamee alone refused to drink. He sat a little to one side,
disassociating himself from what was going forward, watching the others
calmly, a little contemptuously, a cigarette in his fingers.

Hooven, after drinking his third glass, however, was afflicted with a
great sadness; his breast heaved with immense sighs. He asserted that he
was “obbressed;” Cutter had taken his steer. He retired to a corner and
seated himself in a heap on his chair, his heels on the rungs, wiping
the tears from his eyes, refusing to be comforted. Old Broderson
startled Annixter, who sat next to him, out of all measure by suddenly
winking at him with infinite craftiness.

“When I was a lad in Ukiah,” he whispered hoarsely, “I was a devil of a
fellow with the girls; but Lordy!” he nudged him slyly, “I wouldn't have
it known!”

Of those who were drinking, Annixter alone retained all his wits. Though
keeping pace with the others, glass for glass, the punch left him solid
upon his feet, clear-headed. The tough, cross-grained fibre of him
seemed proof against alcohol. Never in his life had he been drunk. He
prided himself upon his power of resistance. It was his nature.

“Say!” exclaimed old Broderson, gravely addressing the company, pulling
at his beard uneasily--“say! I--I--listen! I'm a devil of a fellow with
the girls.” He wagged his head doggedly, shutting his eyes in a knowing
fashion. “Yes, sir, I am. There was a young lady in Ukiah--that was
when I was a lad of seventeen. We used to meet in the cemetery in the
afternoons. I was to go away to school at Sacramento, and the afternoon
I left we met in the cemetery and we stayed so long I almost missed the
train. Her name was Celestine.”

There was a pause. The others waited for the rest of the story.

“And afterwards?” prompted Annixter.

“Afterwards? Nothing afterwards. I never saw her again. Her name was
Celestine.”

The company raised a chorus of derision, and Osterman cried ironically:

“Say! THAT'S a pretty good one! Tell us another.”

The old man laughed with the rest, believing he had made another hit. He
called Osterman to him, whispering in his ear:

“Sh! Look here! Some night you and I will go up to San Francisco--hey?
We'll go skylarking. We'll be gay. Oh, I'm a--a--a rare old BUCK, I am!
I ain't too old. You'll see.”

Annixter gave over the making of the fifth bowl of punch to Osterman,
who affirmed that he had a recipe for a “fertiliser” from Solotari
that would take the plating off the ladle. He left him wrangling with
Caraher, who still persisted in adding chartreuse, and stepped out into
the dance to see how things were getting on.

It was the interval between two dances. In and around a stall at the
farther end of the floor, where lemonade was being served, was a great
throng of young men. Others hurried across the floor singly or by twos
and threes, gingerly carrying overflowing glasses to their “partners,”
 sitting in long rows of white and blue and pink against the opposite
wall, their mothers and older sisters in a second dark-clothed rank
behind them. A babel of talk was in the air, mingled with gusts of
laughter. Everybody seemed having a good time. In the increasing heat
the decorations of evergreen trees and festoons threw off a pungent
aroma that suggested a Sunday-school Christmas festival. In the other
stalls, lower down the barn, the young men had brought chairs, and in
these deep recesses the most desperate love-making was in progress, the
young man, his hair neatly parted, leaning with great solicitation over
the girl, his “partner” for the moment, fanning her conscientiously, his
arm carefully laid along the back of her chair.

By the doorway, Annixter met Sarria, who had stepped out to smoke a fat,
black cigar. The set smile of amiability was still fixed on the priest's
smooth, shiny face; the cigar ashes had left grey streaks on the front
of his cassock. He avoided Annixter, fearing, no doubt, an allusion
to his game cocks, and took up his position back of the second rank of
chairs by the musicians' stand, beaming encouragingly upon every one who
caught his eye.

Annixter was saluted right and left as he slowly went the round of the
floor. At every moment he had to pause to shake hands and to listen to
congratulations upon the size of his barn and the success of his dance.
But he was distrait, his thoughts elsewhere; he did not attempt to
hide his impatience when some of the young men tried to engage him in
conversation, asking him to be introduced to their sisters, or their
friends' sisters. He sent them about their business harshly, abominably
rude, leaving a wake of angry disturbance behind him, sowing the seeds
of future quarrels and renewed unpopularity. He was looking for Hilma
Tree.

When at last he came unexpectedly upon her, standing near where Mrs.
Tree was seated, some half-dozen young men hovering uneasily in her
neighbourhood, all his audacity was suddenly stricken from him; his
gruffness, his overbearing insolence vanished with an abruptness that
left him cold. His old-time confusion and embarrassment returned to him.
Instead of speaking to her as he intended, he affected not to see her,
but passed by, his head in the air, pretending a sudden interest in a
Japanese lantern that was about to catch fire.

But he had had a single distinct glimpse of her, definite, precise,
and this glimpse was enough. Hilma had changed. The change was
subtle, evanescent, hard to define, but not the less unmistakable. The
excitement, the enchanting delight, the delicious disturbance of “the
first ball,” had produced its result. Perhaps there had only been this
lacking. It was hard to say, but for that brief instant of time Annixter
was looking at Hilma, the woman. She was no longer the young girl upon
whom he might look down, to whom he might condescend, whose little,
infantile graces were to be considered with amused toleration.

When Annixter returned to the harness room, he let himself into a
clamour of masculine hilarity. Osterman had, indeed, made a marvellous
“fertiliser,” whiskey for the most part, diluted with champagne and
lemon juice. The first round of this drink had been welcomed with
a salvo of cheers. Hooven, recovering his spirits under its violent
stimulation, spoke of “heving ut oudt mit Cudder, bei Gott,” while
Osterman, standing on a chair at the end of the room, shouted for a
“few moments quiet, gentlemen,” so that he might tell a certain story
he knew. But, abruptly, Annixter discovered that the liquors--the
champagne, whiskey, brandy, and the like--were running low. This would
never do. He felt that he would stand disgraced if it could be
said afterward that he had not provided sufficient drink at his
entertainment. He slipped out, unobserved, and, finding two of his ranch
hands near the doorway, sent them down to the ranch house to bring up
all the cases of “stuff” they found there.

However, when this matter had been attended to, Annixter did not
immediately return to the harness room. On the floor of the barn a
square dance was under way, the leader of the City Band calling the
figures. Young Vacca indefatigably continued the rounds of the barn,
paring candle after candle, possessed with this single idea of duty,
pushing the dancers out of his way, refusing to admit that the floor was
yet sufficiently slippery. The druggist had returned indoors, and leaned
dejected and melancholy against the wall near the doorway, unable to
dance, his evening's enjoyment spoiled. The gayly apparelled clerk from
Bonneville had just involved himself in a deplorable incident. In a
search for his handkerchief, which he had lost while trying to find his
programme card, he had inadvertently wandered into the feed room, set
apart as the ladies' dressing room, at the moment when Mrs. Hooven,
having removed the waist of Minna's dress, was relacing her corsets.
There was a tremendous scene. The clerk was ejected forcibly, Mrs.
Hooven filling all the neighbourhood with shrill expostulation. A young
man, Minna's “partner,” who stood near the feed room door, waiting for
her to come out, had invited the clerk, with elaborate sarcasm, to step
outside for a moment; and the clerk, breathless, stupefied, hustled from
hand to hand, remained petrified, with staring eyes, turning about and
about, looking wildly from face to face, speechless, witless, wondering
what had happened.

But the square dance was over. The City Band was just beginning to play
a waltz. Annixter assuring himself that everything was going all right,
was picking his way across the floor, when he came upon Hilma Tree quite
alone, and looking anxiously among the crowd of dancers.

“Having a good time, Miss Hilma?” he demanded, pausing for a moment.

“Oh, am I, JUST!” she exclaimed. “The best time--but I don't know what
has become of my partner. See! I'm left all alone--the only time this
whole evening,” she added proudly. “Have you seen him--my partner, sir?
I forget his name. I only met him this evening, and I've met SO many
I can't begin to remember half of them. He was a young man from
Bonneville--a clerk, I think, because I remember seeing him in a store
there, and he wore the prettiest clothes!”

“I guess he got lost in the shuffle,” observed Annixter. Suddenly an
idea occurred to him. He took his resolution in both hands. He clenched
his teeth.

“Say! look here, Miss Hilma. What's the matter with you and I stealing
this one for ourselves? I don't mean to dance. I don't propose to make
a jumping-jack of myself for some galoot to give me the laugh, but we'll
walk around. Will you? What do you say?”

Hilma consented.

“I'm not so VERY sorry I missed my dance with that--that--little clerk,”
 she said guiltily. “I suppose that's very bad of me, isn't it?”

Annixter fulminated a vigorous protest.

“I AM so warm!” murmured Hilma, fanning herself with her handkerchief;
“and, oh! SUCH a good time as I have had! I was so afraid that I would
be a wall-flower and sit up by mamma and papa the whole evening; and
as it is, I have had every single dance, and even some dances I had to
split. Oh-h!” she breathed, glancing lovingly around the barn, noting
again the festoons of tri-coloured cambric, the Japanese lanterns,
flaring lamps, and “decorations” of evergreen; “oh-h! it's all so
lovely, just like a fairy story; and to think that it can't last but for
one little evening, and that to-morrow morning one must wake up to the
every-day things again!”

“Well,” observed Annixter doggedly, unwilling that she should forget
whom she ought to thank, “I did my best, and my best is as good as
another man's, I guess.”

Hilma overwhelmed him with a burst of gratitude which he gruffly
pretended to deprecate. Oh, that was all right. It hadn't cost him much.
He liked to see people having a good time himself, and the crowd did
seem to be enjoying themselves. What did SHE think? Did things look
lively enough? And how about herself--was she enjoying it?

Stupidly Annixter drove the question home again, at his wits' end as to
how to make conversation. Hilma protested volubly she would never forget
this night, adding:

“Dance! Oh, you don't know how I love it! I didn't know myself. I could
dance all night and never stop once!”

Annixter was smitten with uneasiness. No doubt this “promenading” was
not at all to her taste. Wondering what kind of a spectacle he was about
to make of himself, he exclaimed:

“Want to dance now?”

“Oh, yes!” she returned.

They paused in their walk, and Hilma, facing him, gave herself into
his arms. Annixter shut his teeth, the perspiration starting from his
forehead. For five years he had abandoned dancing. Never in his best
days had it been one of his accomplishments.

They hesitated a moment, waiting to catch the time from the musicians.
Another couple bore down upon them at precisely the wrong moment,
jostling them out of step. Annixter swore under his breath. His arm
still about the young woman, he pulled her over to one corner.

“Now,” he muttered, “we'll try again.”

A second time, listening to the one-two-three, one-two-three cadence of
the musicians, they endeavoured to get under way. Annixter waited the
fraction of a second too long and stepped on Hilma's foot. On the third
attempt, having worked out of the corner, a pair of dancers bumped into
them once more, and as they were recovering themselves another couple
caromed violently against Annixter so that he all but lost his footing.
He was in a rage. Hilma, very embarrassed, was trying not to laugh, and
thus they found themselves, out in the middle of the floor, continually
jostled from their position, holding clumsily to each other, stammering
excuses into one another's faces, when Delaney arrived.

He came with the suddenness of an explosion. There was a commotion by
the doorway, a rolling burst of oaths, a furious stamping of hoofs, a
wild scramble of the dancers to either side of the room, and there he
was. He had ridden the buckskin at a gallop straight through the doorway
and out into the middle of the floor of the barn.

Once well inside, Delaney hauled up on the cruel spade-bit, at the same
time driving home the spurs, and the buckskin, without halting in her
gait, rose into the air upon her hind feet, and coming down again with a
thunder of iron hoofs upon the hollow floor, lashed out with both heels
simultaneously, her back arched, her head between her knees. It was the
running buck, and had not Delaney been the hardest buster in the county,
would have flung him headlong like a sack of sand. But he eased off the
bit, gripping the mare's flanks with his knees, and the buckskin, having
long since known her master, came to hand quivering, the bloody spume
dripping from the bit upon the slippery floor.

Delaney had arrayed himself with painful elaboration, determined to
look the part, bent upon creating the impression, resolved that his
appearance at least should justify his reputation of being “bad.”
 Nothing was lacking--neither the campaign hat with upturned brim, nor
the dotted blue handkerchief knotted behind the neck, nor the heavy
gauntlets stitched with red, nor--this above all--the bear-skin
“chaparejos,” the hair trousers of the mountain cowboy, the pistol
holster low on the thigh. But for the moment this holster was empty,
and in his right hand, the hammer at full cock, the chamber loaded,
the puncher flourished his teaser, an army Colt's, the lamplight dully
reflected in the dark blue steel.

In a second of time the dance was a bedlam. The musicians stopped with a
discord, and the middle of the crowded floor bared itself instantly. It
was like sand blown from off a rock; the throng of guests, carried by an
impulse that was not to be resisted, bore back against the sides of
the barn, overturning chairs, tripping upon each other, falling down,
scrambling to their feet again, stepping over one another, getting
behind each other, diving under chairs, flattening themselves against
the wall--a wild, clamouring pell-mell, blind, deaf, panic-stricken;
a confused tangle of waving arms, torn muslin, crushed flowers, pale
faces, tangled legs, that swept in all directions back from the centre
of the floor, leaving Annixter and Hilma, alone, deserted, their arms
about each other, face to face with Delaney, mad with alcohol, bursting
with remembered insult, bent on evil, reckless of results.

After the first scramble for safety, the crowd fell quiet for the
fraction of an instant, glued to the walls, afraid to stir, struck dumb
and motionless with surprise and terror, and in the instant's silence
that followed Annixter, his eyes on Delaney, muttered rapidly to Hilma:

“Get back, get away to one side. The fool MIGHT shoot.”

There was a second's respite afforded while Delaney occupied himself
in quieting the buckskin, and in that second of time, at this moment of
crisis, the wonderful thing occurred. Hilma, turning from Delaney, her
hands clasped on Annixter's arm, her eyes meeting his, exclaimed:

“You, too!”

And that was all; but to Annixter it was a revelation. Never more alive
to his surroundings, never more observant, he suddenly understood. For
the briefest lapse of time he and Hilma looked deep into each other's
eyes, and from that moment on, Annixter knew that Hilma cared.

The whole matter was brief as the snapping of a finger. Two words and
a glance and all was done. But as though nothing had occurred, Annixter
pushed Hilma from him, repeating harshly:

“Get back, I tell you. Don't you see he's got a gun? Haven't I enough on
my hands without you?”

He loosed her clasp and his eyes once more on Delaney, moved diagonally
backwards toward the side of the barn, pushing Hilma from him. In
the end he thrust her away so sharply that she gave back with a long
stagger; somebody caught her arm and drew her in, leaving Annixter alone
once more in the middle of the floor, his hands in his coat pockets,
watchful, alert, facing his enemy.

But the cow-puncher was not ready to come to grapples yet. Fearless,
his wits gambolling under the lash of the alcohol, he wished to make the
most of the occasion, maintaining the suspense, playing for the gallery.
By touches of the hand and knee he kept the buckskin in continual,
nervous movement, her hoofs clattering, snorting, tossing her head,
while he, himself, addressing himself to Annixter, poured out a torrent
of invective.

“Well, strike me blind if it ain't old Buck Annixter! He was going to
show me off Quien Sabe at the toe of his boot, was he? Well, here's
your chance,--with the ladies to see you do it. Gives a dance, does
he, high-falutin' hoe-down in his barn and forgets to invite his old
broncho-bustin' friend. But his friend don't forget him; no, he don't.
He remembers little things, does his broncho-bustin' friend. Likes to
see a dance hisself on occasion, his friend does. Comes anyhow, trustin'
his welcome will be hearty; just to see old Buck Annixter dance, just to
show Buck Annixter's friends how Buck can dance--dance all by hisself, a
little hen-on-a-hot-plate dance when his broncho-bustin' friend asks
him so polite. A little dance for the ladies, Buck. This feature of
the entertainment is alone worth the price of admission. Tune up, Buck.
Attention now! I'll give you the key.”

He “fanned” his revolver, spinning it about his index finger by the
trigger-guard with incredible swiftness, the twirling weapon a mere blur
of blue steel in his hand. Suddenly and without any apparent cessation
of the movement, he fired, and a little splinter of wood flipped into
the air at Annixter's feet.

“Time!” he shouted, while the buckskin reared to the report. “Hold
on--wait a minute. This place is too light to suit. That big light
yonder is in my eyes. Look out, I'm going to throw lead.”

A second shot put out the lamp over the musicians' stand. The assembled
guests shrieked, a frantic, shrinking quiver ran through the crowd like
the huddling of frightened rabbits in their pen.

Annixter hardly moved. He stood some thirty paces from the buster,
his hands still in his coat pockets, his eyes glistening, watchful.
Excitable and turbulent in trifling matters, when actual bodily danger
threatened he was of an abnormal quiet.

“I'm watching you,” cried the other. “Don't make any mistake about that.
Keep your hands in your COAT pockets, if you'd like to live a little
longer, understand? And don't let me see you make a move toward your hip
or your friends will be asked to identify you at the morgue to-morrow
morning. When I'm bad, I'm called the Undertaker's Friend, so I am, and
I'm that bad to-night that I'm scared of myself. They'll have to revise
the census returns before I'm done with this place. Come on, now, I'm
getting tired waiting. I come to see a dance.”

“Hand over that horse, Delaney,” said Annixter, without raising his
voice, “and clear out.”

The other affected to be overwhelmed with infinite astonishment, his
eyes staring. He peered down from the saddle.

“Wh-a-a-t!” he exclaimed; “wh-a-a-t did you say? Why, I guess you must
be looking for trouble; that's what I guess.”

“There's where you're wrong, m'son,” muttered Annixter, partly to
Delaney, partly to himself. “If I was looking for trouble there wouldn't
be any guess-work about it.”

With the words he began firing. Delaney had hardly entered the barn
before Annixter's plan had been formed. Long since his revolver was
in the pocket of his coat, and he fired now through the coat itself,
without withdrawing his hands.

Until that moment Annixter had not been sure of himself. There was
no doubt that for the first few moments of the affair he would
have welcomed with joy any reasonable excuse for getting out of the
situation. But the sound of his own revolver gave him confidence. He
whipped it from his pocket and fired again.

Abruptly the duel began, report following report, spurts of pale blue
smoke jetting like the darts of short spears between the two men,
expanding to a haze and drifting overhead in wavering strata. It was
quite probable that no thought of killing each other suggested itself to
either Annixter or Delaney. Both fired without aiming very deliberately.
To empty their revolvers and avoid being hit was the desire common to
both. They no longer vituperated each other. The revolvers spoke for
them.

Long after, Annixter could recall this moment. For years he could
with but little effort reconstruct the scene--the densely packed crowd
flattened against the sides of the barn, the festoons of lanterns, the
mingled smell of evergreens, new wood, sachets, and powder smoke;
the vague clamour of distress and terror that rose from the throng of
guests, the squealing of the buckskin, the uneven explosions of the
revolvers, the reverberation of trampling hoofs, a brief glimpse of
Harran Derrick's excited face at the door of the harness room, and
in the open space in the centre of the floor, himself and Delaney,
manoeuvring swiftly in a cloud of smoke.

Annixter's revolver contained but six cartridges. Already it seemed to
him as if he had fired twenty times. Without doubt the next shot was
his last. Then what? He peered through the blue haze that with every
discharge thickened between him and the buster. For his own safety
he must “place” at least one shot. Delaney's chest and shoulders rose
suddenly above the smoke close upon him as the distraught buckskin
reared again. Annixter, for the first time during the fight, took
definite aim, but before he could draw the trigger there was a great
shout and he was aware of the buckskin, the bridle trailing, the saddle
empty, plunging headlong across the floor, crashing into the line of
chairs. Delaney was scrambling off the floor. There was blood on the
buster's wrist and he no longer carried his revolver. Suddenly he turned
and ran. The crowd parted right and left before him as he made toward
the doorway. He disappeared.

Twenty men promptly sprang to the buckskin's head, but she broke away,
and wild with terror, bewildered, blind, insensate, charged into the
corner of the barn by the musicians' stand. She brought up against the
wall with cruel force and with impact of a sack of stones; her head was
cut. She turned and charged again, bull-like, the blood streaming from
her forehead. The crowd, shrieking, melted before her rush. An old
man was thrown down and trampled. The buckskin trod upon the dragging
bridle, somersaulted into a confusion of chairs in one corner, and came
down with a terrific clatter in a wild disorder of kicking hoofs and
splintered wood. But a crowd of men fell upon her, tugging at the bit,
sitting on her head, shouting, gesticulating. For five minutes she
struggled and fought; then, by degrees, she recovered herself, drawing
great sobbing breaths at long intervals that all but burst the girths,
rolling her eyes in bewildered, supplicating fashion, trembling in every
muscle, and starting and shrinking now and then like a young girl in
hysterics. At last she lay quiet. The men allowed her to struggle to her
feet. The saddle was removed and she was led to one of the empty stalls,
where she remained the rest of the evening, her head low, her pasterns
quivering, turning her head apprehensively from time to time, showing
the white of one eye and at long intervals heaving a single prolonged
sigh.

And an hour later the dance was progressing as evenly as though nothing
in the least extraordinary had occurred. The incident was closed--that
abrupt swoop of terror and impending death dropping down there from out
the darkness, cutting abruptly athwart the gayety of the moment, come
and gone with the swiftness of a thunderclap. Many of the women had gone
home, taking their men with them; but the great bulk of the crowd still
remained, seeing no reason why the episode should interfere with the
evening's enjoyment, resolved to hold the ground for mere bravado, if
for nothing else. Delaney would not come back, of that everybody was
persuaded, and in case he should, there was not found wanting fully half
a hundred young men who would give him a dressing down, by jingo! They
had been too surprised to act when Delaney had first appeared, and
before they knew where they were at, the buster had cleared out. In
another minute, just another second, they would have shown him--yes,
sir, by jingo!--ah, you bet!

On all sides the reminiscences began to circulate. At least one man in
every three had been involved in a gun fight at some time of his life.
“Ah, you ought to have seen in Yuba County one time--” “Why, in Butte
County in the early days--” “Pshaw! this to-night wasn't anything! Why,
once in a saloon in Arizona when I was there--” and so on, over and over
again. Osterman solemnly asserted that he had seen a greaser sawn in two
in a Nevada sawmill. Old Broderson had witnessed a Vigilante lynching in
'55 on California Street in San Francisco. Dyke recalled how once in his
engineering days he had run over a drunk at a street crossing. Gethings
of the San Pablo had taken a shot at a highwayman. Hooven had bayonetted
a French Chasseur at Sedan. An old Spanish-Mexican, a centenarian from
Guadalajara, remembered Fremont's stand on a mountain top in San Benito
County. The druggist had fired at a burglar trying to break into
his store one New Year's eve. Young Vacca had seen a dog shot in
Guadalajara. Father Sarria had more than once administered the
sacraments to Portuguese desperadoes dying of gunshot wounds. Even the
women recalled terrible scenes. Mrs. Cutter recounted to an interested
group how she had seen a claim jumped in Placer County in 1851, when
three men were shot, falling in a fusillade of rifle shots, and expiring
later upon the floor of her kitchen while she looked on. Mrs. Dyke
had been in a stage hold-up, when the shotgun messenger was murdered.
Stories by the hundreds went the round of the company. The air was
surcharged with blood, dying groans, the reek of powder smoke, the crack
of rifles. All the legends of '49, the violent, wild life of the early
days, were recalled to view, defiling before them there in an endless
procession under the glare of paper lanterns and kerosene lamps.

But the affair had aroused a combative spirit amongst the men of the
assembly. Instantly a spirit of aggression, of truculence, swelled up
underneath waistcoats and starched shirt bosoms. More than one offender
was promptly asked to “step outside.” It was like young bucks excited
by an encounter of stags, lowering their horns upon the slightest
provocation, showing off before the does and fawns. Old quarrels were
remembered. One sought laboriously for slights and insults, veiled in
ordinary conversation. The sense of personal honour became refined to
a delicate, fine point. Upon the slightest pretext there was a haughty
drawing up of the figure, a twisting of the lips into a smile of scorn.
Caraher spoke of shooting S. Behrman on sight before the end of the
week. Twice it became necessary to separate Hooven and Cutter, renewing
their quarrel as to the ownership of the steer. All at once Minna
Hooven's “partner” fell upon the gayly apparelled clerk from
Bonneville, pummelling him with his fists, hustling him out of the hall,
vociferating that Miss Hooven had been grossly insulted. It took three
men to extricate the clerk from his clutches, dazed, gasping, his collar
unfastened and sticking up into his face, his eyes staring wildly into
the faces of the crowd.

But Annixter, bursting with pride, his chest thrown out, his chin in
the air, reigned enthroned in a circle of adulation. He was the Hero. To
shake him by the hand was an honour to be struggled for. One clapped
him on the back with solemn nods of approval. “There's the BOY for you;”
 “There was nerve for you;” “What's the matter with Annixter?” “How about
THAT for sand, and how was THAT for a SHOT?” “Why, Apache Kid couldn't
have bettered that.” “Cool enough.” “Took a steady eye and a sure hand
to make a shot like that.” “There was a shot that would be told about in
Tulare County fifty years to come.”

Annixter had refrained from replying, all ears to this conversation,
wondering just what had happened. He knew only that Delaney had run,
leaving his revolver and a spatter of blood behind him. By degrees,
however, he ascertained that his last shot but one had struck Delaney's
pistol hand, shattering it and knocking the revolver from his grip. He
was overwhelmed with astonishment. Why, after the shooting began he
had not so much as seen Delaney with any degree of plainness. The whole
affair was a whirl.

“Well, where did YOU learn to shoot THAT way?” some one in the crowd
demanded. Annixter moved his shoulders with a gesture of vast unconcern.

“Oh,” he observed carelessly, “it's not my SHOOTING that ever worried
ME, m'son.”

The crowd gaped with delight. There was a great wagging of heads.

“Well, I guess not.”

“No, sir, not much.”

“Ah, no, you bet not.”

When the women pressed around him, shaking his hands, declaring that
he had saved their daughters' lives, Annixter assumed a pose of superb
deprecation, the modest self-obliteration of the chevalier. He delivered
himself of a remembered phrase, very elegant, refined. It was Lancelot
after the tournament, Bayard receiving felicitations after the battle.

“Oh, don't say anything about it,” he murmured. “I only did what any man
would have done in my place.”

To restore completely the equanimity of the company, he announced
supper. This he had calculated as a tremendous surprise. It was to have
been served at mid-night, but the irruption of Delaney had dislocated
the order of events, and the tables were brought in an hour ahead of
time. They were arranged around three sides of the barn and were loaded
down with cold roasts of beef, cold chickens and cold ducks, mountains
of sandwiches, pitchers of milk and lemonade, entire cheeses, bowls
of olives, plates of oranges and nuts. The advent of this supper was
received with a volley of applause. The musicians played a quick step.
The company threw themselves upon the food with a great scraping of
chairs and a vast rustle of muslins, tarletans, and organdies; soon
the clatter of dishes was a veritable uproar. The tables were taken by
assault. One ate whatever was nearest at hand, some even beginning with
oranges and nuts and ending with beef and chicken. At the end the paper
caps were brought on, together with the ice cream. All up and down the
tables the pulled “crackers” snapped continually like the discharge of
innumerable tiny rifles.

The caps of tissue paper were put on--“Phrygian Bonnets,” “Magicians'
Caps,” “Liberty Caps;” the young girls looked across the table at their
vis-a-vis with bursts of laughter and vigorous clapping of the hands.

The harness room crowd had a table to themselves, at the head of which
sat Annixter and at the foot Harran. The gun fight had sobered
Presley thoroughly. He sat by the side of Vanamee, who ate but little,
preferring rather to watch the scene with calm observation, a little
contemptuous when the uproar around the table was too boisterous,
savouring of intoxication. Osterman rolled bullets of bread and shot
them with astonishing force up and down the table, but the others--Dyke,
old Broderson, Caraher, Harran Derrick, Hooven, Cutter, Garnett of the
Ruby rancho, Keast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings of the San
Pablo, and Chattern of the Bonanza--occupied themselves with eating as
much as they could before the supper gave out. At a corner of the table,
speechless, unobserved, ignored, sat Dabney, of whom nothing was known
but his name, the silent old man who made no friends. He ate and drank
quietly, dipping his sandwich in his lemonade.

Osterman ate all the olives he could lay his hands on, a score of them,
fifty of them, a hundred of them. He touched no crumb of anything else.
Old Broderson stared at him, his jaw fallen. Osterman declared he had
once eaten a thousand on a bet. The men called each others' attention to
him. Delighted to create a sensation, Osterman persevered. The contents
of an entire bowl disappeared in his huge, reptilian slit of a mouth.
His cheeks of brownish red were extended, his bald forehead glistened.
Colics seized upon him. His stomach revolted. It was all one with him.
He was satisfied, contented. He was astonishing the people.

“Once I swallowed a tree toad.” he told old Broderson, “by mistake.
I was eating grapes, and the beggar lived in me three weeks. In rainy
weather he would sing. You don't believe that,” he vociferated. “Haven't
I got the toad at home now in a bottle of alcohol.”

And the old man, never doubting, his eyes starting, wagged his head in
amazement.

“Oh, yes,” cried Caraher, the length of the table, “that's a pretty good
one. Tell us another.”

“That reminds me of a story,” hazarded old Broderson uncertainly; “once
when I was a lad in Ukiah, fifty years.”

“Oh, yes,” cried half a dozen voices, “THAT'S a pretty good one. Tell us
another.”

“Eh--wh--what?” murmured Broderson, looking about him. “I--I don't know.
It was Ukiah. You--you--you mix me all up.”

As soon as supper was over, the floor was cleared again. The guests
clamoured for a Virginia reel. The last quarter of the evening, the time
of the most riotous fun, was beginning. The young men caught the
girls who sat next to them. The orchestra dashed off into a rollicking
movement. The two lines were formed. In a second of time the dance
was under way again; the guests still wearing the Phrygian bonnets and
liberty caps of pink and blue tissue paper.

But the group of men once more adjourned to the harness room. Fresh
boxes of cigars were opened; the seventh bowl of fertiliser was mixed.
Osterman poured the dregs of a glass of it upon his bald head, declaring
that he could feel the hair beginning to grow.

But suddenly old Broderson rose to his feet.

“Aha,” he cackled, “I'M going to have a dance, I am. Think I'm too
old? I'll show you young fellows. I'm a regular old ROOSTER when I get
started.”

He marched out into the barn, the others following, holding their sides.
He found an aged Mexican woman by the door and hustled her, all confused
and giggling, into the Virginia reel, then at its height. Every one
crowded around to see. Old Broderson stepped off with the alacrity of a
colt, snapping his fingers, slapping his thigh, his mouth widening in
an excited grin. The entire company of the guests shouted. The City Band
redoubled their efforts; and the old man, losing his head, breathless,
gasping, dislocated his stiff joints in his efforts. He became
possessed, bowing, scraping, advancing, retreating, wagging his beard,
cutting pigeons' wings, distraught with the music, the clamour, the
applause, the effects of the fertiliser.

Annixter shouted:

“Nice eye, Santa Claus.”

But Annixter's attention wandered. He searched for Hilma Tree, having
still in mind the look in her eyes at that swift moment of danger. He
had not seen her since then. At last he caught sight of her. She was not
dancing, but, instead, was sitting with her “partner” at the end of the
barn near her father and mother, her eyes wide, a serious expression on
her face, her thoughts, no doubt, elsewhere. Annixter was about to go to
her when he was interrupted by a cry.

Old Broderson, in the midst of a double shuffle, had clapped his hand
to his side with a gasp, which he followed by a whoop of anguish. He
had got a stitch or had started a twinge somewhere. With a gesture
of resignation, he drew himself laboriously out of the dance, limping
abominably, one leg dragging. He was heard asking for his wife. Old Mrs.
Broderson took him in charge. She jawed him for making an exhibition of
himself, scolding as though he were a ten-year-old.

“Well, I want to know!” she exclaimed, as he hobbled off, dejected and
melancholy, leaning upon her arm, “thought he had to dance, indeed! What
next? A gay old grandpa, this. He'd better be thinking of his coffin.”

It was almost midnight. The dance drew towards its close in a storm
of jubilation. The perspiring musicians toiled like galley slaves; the
guests singing as they danced.

The group of men reassembled in the harness room. Even Magnus Derrick
condescended to enter and drink a toast. Presley and Vanamee, still
holding themselves aloof, looked on, Vanamee more and more disgusted.
Dabney, standing to one side, overlooked and forgotten, continued to
sip steadily at his glass, solemn, reserved. Garnett of the Ruby rancho,
Keast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings of the San Pablo, and
Chattern of the Bonanza, leaned back in their chairs, their waist-coats
unbuttoned, their legs spread wide, laughing--they could not tell why.
Other ranchers, men whom Annixter had never seen, appeared in the room,
wheat growers from places as far distant as Goshen and Pixley; young men
and old, proprietors of veritable principalities, hundreds of thousands
of acres of wheat lands, a dozen of them, a score of them; men who were
strangers to each other, but who made it a point to shake hands with
Magnus Derrick, the “prominent man” of the valley. Old Broderson, whom
every one had believed had gone home, returned, though much sobered, and
took his place, refusing, however, to drink another spoonful.

Soon the entire number of Annixter's guests found themselves in two
companies, the dancers on the floor of the barn, frolicking through the
last figures of the Virginia reel and the boisterous gathering of men in
the harness room, downing the last quarts of fertiliser. Both assemblies
had been increased. Even the older people had joined in the dance, while
nearly every one of the men who did not dance had found their way into
the harness room. The two groups rivalled each other in their noise. Out
on the floor of the barn was a very whirlwind of gayety, a tempest of
laughter, hand-clapping and cries of amusement. In the harness room
the confused shouting and singing, the stamping of heavy feet, set a
quivering reverberation in the oil of the kerosene lamps, the flame of
the candles in the Japanese lanterns flaring and swaying in the gusts
of hilarity. At intervals, between the two, one heard the music, the
wailing of the violins, the vigorous snarling of the cornet, and the
harsh, incessant rasping of the snare drum.

And at times all these various sounds mingled in a single vague
note, huge, clamorous, that rose up into the night from the colossal,
reverberating compass of the barn and sent its echoes far off across the
unbroken levels of the surrounding ranches, stretching out to infinity
under the clouded sky, calm, mysterious, still.

Annixter, the punch bowl clasped in his arms, was pouring out the last
spoonful of liquor into Caraher's glass when he was aware that some one
was pulling at the sleeve of his coat. He set down the punch bowl.

“Well, where did YOU come from?” he demanded.

It was a messenger from Bonneville, the uniformed boy that the telephone
company employed to carry messages. He had just arrived from town on his
bicycle, out of breath and panting.

“Message for you, sir. Will you sign?”

He held the book to Annixter, who signed the receipt, wondering.

The boy departed, leaving a thick envelope of yellow paper in Annixter's
hands, the address typewritten, the word “Urgent” written in blue pencil
in one corner.

Annixter tore it open. The envelope contained other sealed envelopes,
some eight or ten of them, addressed to Magnus Derrick, Osterman,
Broderson, Garnett, Keast, Gethings, Chattern, Dabney, and to Annixter
himself.

Still puzzled, Annixter distributed the envelopes, muttering to himself:

“What's up now?”

The incident had attracted attention. A comparative quiet followed, the
guests following the letters with their eyes as they were passed around
the table. They fancied that Annixter had arranged a surprise.

Magnus Derrick, who sat next to Annixter, was the first to receive his
letter. With a word of excuse he opened it.

“Read it, read it, Governor,” shouted a half-dozen voices. “No secrets,
you know. Everything above board here to-night.”

Magnus cast a glance at the contents of the letter, then rose to his
feet and read:


     Magnus Derrick,
         Bonneville, Tulare Co., Cal.


     Dear Sir:

     By regrade of October 1st, the value of the railroad land you
     occupy, included in your ranch of Los Muertos, has been fixed at
     $27.00 per acre.  The land is now for sale at that price to any
     one.

                           Yours, etc.,
                   CYRUS BLAKELEE RUGGLES,
                           Land Agent, P. and S. W. R. R.

                   S. BEHRMAN,
                           Local Agent, P. and S. W. R. R.

In the midst of the profound silence that followed, Osterman was heard
to exclaim grimly:

“THAT'S a pretty good one. Tell us another.”

But for a long moment this was the only remark.

The silence widened, broken only by the sound of torn paper as Annixter,
Osterman, old Broderson, Garnett, Keast, Gethings, Chattern, and Dabney
opened and read their letters. They were all to the same effect, almost
word for word like the Governor's. Only the figures and the proper names
varied. In some cases the price per acre was twenty-two dollars. In
Annixter's case it was thirty.

“And--and the company promised to sell to me, to--to all of us,” gasped
old Broderson, “at TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF an acre.”

It was not alone the ranchers immediately around Bonneville who would
be plundered by this move on the part of the Railroad. The “alternate
section” system applied throughout all the San Joaquin. By striking at
the Bonneville ranchers a terrible precedent was established. Of
the crowd of guests in the harness room alone, nearly every man was
affected, every man menaced with ruin. All of a million acres was
suddenly involved.

Then suddenly the tempest burst. A dozen men were on their feet in an
instant, their teeth set, their fists clenched, their faces purple with
rage. Oaths, curses, maledictions exploded like the firing of successive
mines. Voices quivered with wrath, hands flung upward, the fingers
hooked, prehensile, trembled with anger. The sense of wrongs, the
injustices, the oppression, extortion, and pillage of twenty years
suddenly culminated and found voice in a raucous howl of execration.
For a second there was nothing articulate in that cry of savage
exasperation, nothing even intelligent. It was the human animal hounded
to its corner, exploited, harried to its last stand, at bay, ferocious,
terrible, turning at last with bared teeth and upraised claws to meet
the death grapple. It was the hideous squealing of the tormented brute,
its back to the wall, defending its lair, its mate and its whelps, ready
to bite, to rend, to trample, to batter out the life of The Enemy in a
primeval, bestial welter of blood and fury.

The roar subsided to intermittent clamour, in the pauses of which the
sounds of music and dancing made themselves audible once more.

“S. Behrman again,” vociferated Harran Derrick.

“Chose his moment well,” muttered Annixter. “Hits his hardest when we're
all rounded up having a good time.”

“Gentlemen, this is ruin.”

“What's to be done now?”

“FIGHT! My God! do you think we are going to stand this? Do you think we
CAN?”

The uproar swelled again. The clearer the assembly of ranchers
understood the significance of this move on the part of the Railroad,
the more terrible it appeared, the more flagrant, the more intolerable.
Was it possible, was it within the bounds of imagination that this
tyranny should be contemplated? But they knew--past years had driven
home the lesson--the implacable, iron monster with whom they had to
deal, and again and again the sense of outrage and oppression lashed
them to their feet, their mouths wide with curses, their fists clenched
tight, their throats hoarse with shouting.

“Fight! How fight? What ARE you going to do?”

“If there's a law in this land”

“If there is, it is in Shelgrim's pocket. Who owns the courts in
California? Ain't it Shelgrim?”

“God damn him.”

“Well, how long are you going to stand it? How long before you'll settle
up accounts with six inches of plugged gas-pipe?”

“And our contracts, the solemn pledges of the corporation to sell to us
first of all----”

“And now the land is for sale to anybody.”

“Why, it is a question of my home. Am I to be turned out? Why, I have
put eight thousand dollars into improving this land.”

“And I six thousand, and now that I have, the Railroad grabs it.”

“And the system of irrigating ditches that Derrick and I have been
laying out. There's thousands of dollars in that!”

“I'll fight this out till I've spent every cent of my money.”

“Where? In the courts that the company owns?”

“Think I am going to give in to this? Think I am to get off my land? By
God, gentlemen, law or no law, railroad or no railroad, I--WILL--NOT.”

“Nor I.”

“Nor I.”

“Nor I.”

“This is the last. Legal means first; if those fail--the shotgun.”

“They can kill me. They can shoot me down, but I'll die--die fighting
for my home--before I'll give in to this.”

At length Annixter made himself heard:

“All out of the room but the ranch owners,” he shouted. “Hooven,
Caraher, Dyke, you'll have to clear out. This is a family affair.
Presley, you and your friend can remain.”

Reluctantly the others filed through the door. There remained in the
harness room--besides Vanamee and Presley--Magnus Derrick, Annixter, old
Broderson Harran, Garnett from the Ruby rancho, Keast from the ranch of
the same name, Gethings of the San Pablo, Chattern of the Bonanza, about
a score of others, ranchers from various parts of the county, and, last
of all, Dabney, ignored, silent, to whom nobody spoke and who, as yet,
had not uttered a word. But the men who had been asked to leave the
harness room spread the news throughout the barn. It was repeated from
lip to lip. One by one the guests dropped out of the dance. Groups were
formed. By swift degrees the gayety lapsed away. The Virginia reel
broke up. The musicians ceased playing, and in the place of the noisy,
effervescent revelry of the previous half hour, a subdued murmur filled
all the barn, a mingling of whispers, lowered voices, the coming and
going of light footsteps, the uneasy shifting of positions, while from
behind the closed doors of the harness room came a prolonged, sullen
hum of anger and strenuous debate. The dance came to an abrupt end.
The guests, unwilling to go as yet, stunned, distressed, stood clumsily
about, their eyes vague, their hands swinging at their sides, looking
stupidly into each others' faces. A sense of impending calamity,
oppressive, foreboding, gloomy, passed through the air overhead in the
night, a long shiver of anguish and of terror, mysterious, despairing.

In the harness room, however, the excitement continued unchecked. One
rancher after another delivered himself of a torrent of furious words.
There was no order, merely the frenzied outcry of blind fury. One spirit
alone was common to all--resistance at whatever cost and to whatever
lengths.

Suddenly Osterman leaped to his feet, his bald head gleaming in the
lamp-light, his red ears distended, a flood of words filling his great,
horizontal slit of a mouth, his comic actor's face flaming. Like the
hero of a melodrama, he took stage with a great sweeping gesture.

“ORGANISATION,” he shouted, “that must be our watch-word. The curse
of the ranchers is that they fritter away their strength. Now, we must
stand together, now, NOW. Here's the crisis, here's the moment. Shall we
meet it? I CALL FOR THE LEAGUE. Not next week, not to-morrow, not in the
morning, but now, now, now, this very moment, before we go out of that
door. Every one of us here to join it, to form the beginnings of a vast
organisation, banded together to death, if needs be, for the protection
of our rights and homes. Are you ready? Is it now or never? I call for
the League.”

Instantly there was a shout. With an actor's instinct, Osterman had
spoken at the precise psychological moment. He carried the others off
their feet, glib, dexterous, voluble. Just what was meant by the League
the others did not know, but it was something, a vague engine, a machine
with which to fight. Osterman had not done speaking before the room rang
with outcries, the crowd of men shouting, for what they did not know.

“The League! The League!”

“Now, to-night, this moment; sign our names before we leave.”

“He's right. Organisation! The League!”

“We have a committee at work already,” Osterman vociferated. “I am a
member, and also Mr. Broderson, Mr. Annixter, and Mr. Harran Derrick.
What our aims are we will explain to you later. Let this committee
be the nucleus of the League--temporarily, at least. Trust us. We are
working for you and with you. Let this committee be merged into the
larger committee of the League, and for President of the League”--he
paused the fraction of a second--“for President there can be but one
name mentioned, one man to whom we all must look as leader--Magnus
Derrick.”

The Governor's name was received with a storm of cheers. The harness
room reechoed with shouts of:

“Derrick! Derrick!”

“Magnus for President!”

“Derrick, our natural leader.”

“Derrick, Derrick, Derrick for President.”

Magnus rose to his feet. He made no gesture. Erect as a cavalry officer,
tall, thin, commanding, he dominated the crowd in an instant. There was
a moment's hush. “Gentlemen,” he said, “if organisation is a good word,
moderation is a better one. The matter is too grave for haste. I would
suggest that we each and severally return to our respective homes for
the night, sleep over what has happened, and convene again to-morrow,
when we are calmer and can approach this affair in a more judicious
mood. As for the honour with which you would inform me, I must affirm
that that, too, is a matter for grave deliberation. This League is but
a name as yet. To accept control of an organisation whose principles are
not yet fixed is a heavy responsibility. I shrink from it--”

But he was allowed to proceed no farther. A storm of protest developed.
There were shouts of:

“No, no. The League to-night and Derrick for President.”

“We have been moderate too long.”

“The League first, principles afterward.”

“We can't wait,” declared Osterman. “Many of us cannot attend a meeting
to-morrow. Our business affairs would prevent it. Now we are all
together. I propose a temporary chairman and secretary be named and
a ballot be taken. But first the League. Let us draw up a set of
resolutions to stand together, for the defence of our homes, to death,
if needs be, and each man present affix his signature thereto.”

He subsided amidst vigorous applause. The next quarter of an hour was
a vague confusion, every one talking at once, conversations going on
in low tones in various corners of the room. Ink, pens, and a sheaf of
foolscap were brought from the ranch house. A set of resolutions was
draughted, having the force of a pledge, organising the League of
Defence. Annixter was the first to sign. Others followed, only a few
holding back, refusing to join till they had thought the matter over.
The roll grew; the paper circulated about the table; each signature was
welcomed by a salvo of cheers. At length, it reached Harran Derrick, who
signed amid tremendous uproar. He released the pen only to shake a score
of hands.

“Now, Magnus Derrick.”

“Gentlemen,” began the Governor, once more rising, “I beg of you to
allow me further consideration. Gentlemen--”

He was interrupted by renewed shouting.

“No, no, now or never. Sign, join the League.”

“Don't leave us. We look to you to help.”

But presently the excited throng that turned their faces towards the
Governor were aware of a new face at his elbow. The door of the harness
room had been left unbolted and Mrs. Derrick, unable to endure the
heart-breaking suspense of waiting outside, had gathered up all her
courage and had come into the room. Trembling, she clung to Magnus's
arm, her pretty light-brown hair in disarray, her large young girl's
eyes wide with terror and distrust. What was about to happen she did not
understand, but these men were clamouring for Magnus to pledge himself
to something, to some terrible course of action, some ruthless,
unscrupulous battle to the death with the iron-hearted monster of
steel and steam. Nerved with a coward's intrepidity, she, who so easily
obliterated herself, had found her way into the midst of this frantic
crowd, into this hot, close room, reeking of alcohol and tobacco smoke,
into this atmosphere surcharged with hatred and curses. She seized her
husband's arm imploring, distraught with terror.

“No, no,” she murmured; “no, don't sign.”

She was the feather caught in the whirlwind. En masse, the crowd surged
toward the erect figure of the Governor, the pen in one hand, his wife's
fingers in the other, the roll of signatures before him. The clamour
was deafening; the excitement culminated brusquely. Half a hundred
hands stretched toward him; thirty voices, at top pitch, implored,
expostulated, urged, almost commanded. The reverberation of the shouting
was as the plunge of a cataract.

It was the uprising of The People; the thunder of the outbreak of
revolt; the mob demanding to be led, aroused at last, imperious,
resistless, overwhelming. It was the blind fury of insurrection, the
brute, many-tongued, red-eyed, bellowing for guidance, baring its teeth,
unsheathing its claws, imposing its will with the abrupt, resistless
pressure of the relaxed piston, inexorable, knowing no pity.

“No, no,” implored Annie Derrick. “No, Magnus, don't sign.”

“He must,” declared Harran, shouting in her ear to make himself heard,
“he must. Don't you understand?”

Again the crowd surged forward, roaring. Mrs. Derrick was swept back,
pushed to one side. Her husband no longer belonged to her. She paid the
penalty for being the wife of a great man. The world, like a colossal
iron wedge, crushed itself between. She was thrust to the wall. The
throng of men, stamping, surrounded Magnus; she could no longer see him,
but, terror-struck, she listened. There was a moment's lull, then a vast
thunder of savage jubilation. Magnus had signed.

Harran found his mother leaning against the wall, her hands shut over
her ears; her eyes, dilated with fear, brimming with tears. He led her
from the harness room to the outer room, where Mrs. Tree and Hilma took
charge of her, and then, impatient, refusing to answer the hundreds of
anxious questions that assailed him, hurried back to the harness room.
Already the balloting was in progress, Osterman acting as temporary
chairman on the very first ballot he was made secretary of the League
pro tem., and Magnus unanimously chosen for its President. An executive
committee was formed, which was to meet the next day at the Los Muertos
ranch house.

It was half-past one o'clock. In the barn outside the greater number of
the guests had departed. Long since the musicians had disappeared. There
only remained the families of the ranch owners involved in the meeting
in the harness room. These huddled in isolated groups in corners of the
garish, echoing barn, the women in their wraps, the young men with
their coat collars turned up against the draughts that once more made
themselves felt.

For a long half hour the loud hum of eager conversation continued to
issue from behind the door of the harness room. Then, at length, there
was a prolonged scraping of chairs. The session was over. The men came
out in groups, searching for their families.

At once the homeward movement began. Every one was worn out. Some of the
ranchers' daughters had gone to sleep against their mothers' shoulders.

Billy, the stableman, and his assistant were awakened, and the teams
were hitched up. The stable yard was full of a maze of swinging lanterns
and buggy lamps. The horses fretted, champing the bits; the carry-alls
creaked with the straining of leather and springs as they received their
loads. At every instant one heard the rattle of wheels as vehicle after
vehicle disappeared in the night.

A fine, drizzling rain was falling, and the lamps began to show dim in a
vague haze of orange light.

Magnus Derrick was the last to go. At the doorway of the barn he found
Annixter, the roll of names--which it had been decided he was to keep
in his safe for the moment--under his arm. Silently the two shook hands.
Magnus departed. The grind of the wheels of his carry-all grated sharply
on the gravel of the driveway in front of the ranch house, then, with
a hollow roll across a little plank bridge, gained the roadway. For a
moment the beat of the horses' hoofs made itself heard on the roadway.
It ceased. Suddenly there was a great silence.

Annixter, in the doorway of the great barn, stood looking about him
for a moment, alone, thoughtful. The barn was empty. That astonishing
evening had come to an end. The whirl of things and people, the crowd
of dancers, Delaney, the gun fight, Hilma Tree, her eyes fixed on him
in mute confession, the rabble in the harness room, the news of the
regrade, the fierce outburst of wrath, the hasty organising of the
League, all went spinning confusedly through his recollection. But he
was exhausted. Time enough in the morning to think it all over. By now
it was raining sharply. He put the roll of names into his inside pocket,
threw a sack over his head and shoulders, and went down to the ranch
house.

But in the harness room, lighted by the glittering lanterns and flaring
lamps, in the midst of overturned chairs, spilled liquor, cigar stumps,
and broken glasses, Vanamee and Presley still remained talking, talking.
At length, they rose, and came out upon the floor of the barn and stood
for a moment looking about them.

Billy, the stableman, was going the rounds of the walls, putting out
light after light. By degrees, the vast interior was growing dim. Upon
the roof overhead the rain drummed incessantly, the eaves dripping.
The floor was littered with pine needles, bits of orange peel, ends and
fragments of torn organdies and muslins and bits of tissue paper from
the “Phrygian Bonnets” and “Liberty Caps.” The buckskin mare in the
stall, dozing on three legs, changed position with a long sigh. The
sweat stiffening the hair upon her back and loins, as it dried, gave off
a penetrating, ammoniacal odour that mingled with the stale perfume of
sachet and wilted flowers.

Presley and Vanamee stood looking at the deserted barn. There was a long
silence. Then Presley said:

“Well... what do you think of it all?”

“I think,” answered Vanamee slowly, “I think that there was a dance in
Brussels the night before Waterloo.”
