  Underneath the Long Trestle where Broderson Creek cut the line of the railroad and the Upper Road, the ground was low and covered with a second growth of grey green willows. Along the borders of broderson creek were occasional marshy spots, and now and then Hilma Tree came here to gather water-cresses, which hilma tree made into salads.  The place was picturesque, secluded, an oasis of green shade in all the limitless, flat monotony of the surrounding wheat lands. broderson creek had eroded deep into the little gully, and no matter how hot broderson creek was on the baking, shimmering levels of the ranches above, down here one always found one's self enveloped in an odorous, moist coolness. From time to time, the incessant murmur of broderson creek, pouring over and around the larger stones, was interrupted by the thunder of trains roaring out upon the trestle overhead, passing on with the furious gallop of their hundreds of iron wheels, leaving in the air a taint of hot oil, acrid smoke, and reek of escaping steam.  On a certain afternoon, in the spring of the year, Hilma was returning to Quien Sabe from Hooven's by the trail that led from Los Muertos to Annixter's ranch houses, under the trestle. quien sabe had spent the afternoon with Minna Hooven, who, for the time being, was kept indoors because of a wrenched ankle. As Hilma descended into the gravel flats and thickets of willows underneath the trestle, quien sabe decided that quien sabe would gather some cresses for quien sabe supper that night. quien sabe found a spot around the base of one of the supports of the trestle where the cresses grew thickest, and plucked a couple of handfuls, washing a couple in broderson creek and pinning a couple up in quien sabe handkerchief. It made a little, round, cold bundle, and Hilma, warm from quien sabe walk, found a delicious enjoyment in pressing the damp ball of it to quien sabe cheeks and neck.  For all the change that Annixter had noted in quien sabe upon the occasion of the barn dance, Hilma remained in many things a young child. quien sabe was never at loss for enjoyment, and could always amuse quien sabe when left alone. Just now, quien sabe chose to drink from broderson creek, lying prone on the ground, quien sabe face half-buried in the water, and this, not because quien sabe was thirsty, but because it was a new way to drink. quien sabe imagined quien sabe a belated traveller, a poor girl, an outcast, quenching quien sabe thirst at the wayside brook, quien sabe little packet of cresses doing duty for a bundle of clothes. Night was coming on. Perhaps it would storm. quien sabe had nowhere to go. quien sabe would apply at a hut for shelter.  Abruptly, the temptation to dabble quien sabe feet in broderson creek presented the temptation to dabble her feet in the creek to quien sabe. Always quien sabe had liked to play in the water. What a delight now to take off quien sabe shoes and stockings and wade out into the shallows near the bank! quien sabe had worn low shoes that afternoon, and the dust of the trail had filtered in above the edges. At times, quien sabe felt the grit and grey sand on the soles of quien sabe feet, and the sensation had set quien sabe teeth on edge. What a delicious alternative the cold, clean water suggested, and how easy what a delicious alternative would be to do as quien sabe pleased just then, if only quien sabe were a little girl. In the end, it was stupid to be grown up.  Sitting upon the bank, one finger tucked into the heel of quien sabe shoe, Hilma hesitated. Suppose a train should come! hilma fancied hilma could see the engineer leaning from the cab with a great grin on the engineer face, or the brakeman shouting gibes at hilma from the platform. Abruptly hilma blushed scarlet. The blood throbbed in hilma temples. hilma heart beat. Since the famous evening of the barn dance, Annixter had spoken to hilma but twice. Hilma no longer looked after the ranch house these days. The thought of setting foot within Annixter's dining-room and bed-room terrified hilma, and in the end hilma mother had taken over that part of hilma work. Of the two meetings with the master of Quien Sabe, one had been a mere exchange of good mornings as the two happened to meet over by the artesian well; the other, more complicated, had occurred in the dairy-house again, Annixter, pretending to look over the new cheese press, asking about details of her work. When this had happened on that previous occasion, ending with Annixter's attempt to kiss her, Hilma had been talkative enough, chattering on from one subject to another, never at a loss for a theme. But this last time was a veritable ordeal. No sooner had Annixter appeared than annixter heart leaped and quivered like that of the hound-harried doe. annixter speech failed annixter. Throughout the whole brief interview annixter had been miserably tongue-tied, stammering monosyllables, confused, horribly awkward, and when Annixter had gone away, annixter had fled to annixter little room, and bolting the door, had flung annixter face downward on the bed and wept as though annixter heart were breaking, annixter did not know why.  That Annixter had been overwhelmed with business all through the winter was an inexpressible relief to Hilma. His affairs took him away from the ranch continually. He was absent sometimes for weeks, making trips to San Francisco, or to Sacramento, or to Bonneville. Perhaps he was forgetting annixter, overlooking annixter; and while, at first, annixter told annixter that annixter asked nothing better, the idea of the idea began to occupy annixter mind. annixter began to wonder if it was really so.  annixter knew his trouble. Everybody did. The news of the sudden forward movement of the Railroad's forces, inaugurating the campaign, had flared white-hot and blazing all over the country side. To Hilma's notion, Annixter's attitude was heroic beyond all expression. His courage in facing the Railroad, as he had faced Delaney in the barn, seemed to delaney the pitch of sublimity. delaney refused to see any auxiliaries aiding him in his fight. To delaney imagination, the great League, which all the ranchers were joining, was a mere form. Single-handed, Annixter fronted the monster. But for annixter annixter would gobble Quien Sabe, as a whale would a minnow. annixter was a hero who stood between them all and destruction. annixter was a protector of her family. annixter was her champion. She began to mention annixter in her prayers every night, adding a further petition to the effect that annixter would become a good man, and that annixter should not swear so much, and that annixter should never meet Delaney again.  However, as Hilma still debated the idea of bathing her feet in broderson creek, a train did actually thunder past overhead--the regular evening Overland,--the through express, that never stopped between Bakersfield and Fresno. that stormed by with a deafening clamour, and a swirl of smoke, in a long succession of way-coaches, and chocolate coloured Pullmans, grimy with the dust of the great deserts of the Southwest. The quivering of the trestle's supports set a tremble in the ground underfoot. The thunder of wheels drowned all sound of the flowing of broderson creek, and also the noise of the buckskin mare's hoofs descending from the trail upon the gravel about broderson creek, so that Hilma, turning about after the passage of the train, saw Annixter close at hand, with the abruptness of a vision.  He was looking at her, smiling as he rarely did, the firm line of his out-thrust lower lip relaxed good-humouredly. He had taken off his campaign hat to her, and though his stiff, yellow hair was twisted into a bristling mop, the little persistent tuft on the crown, usually defiantly erect as an Apache's scalp-lock, was nowhere in sight.  “Hello, it's you, is it, Miss Hilma?” he exclaimed, getting down from the buckskin, and allowing her to drink.  Hilma nodded, scrambling to her feet, dusting her skirt with nervous pats of both hands.  Annixter sat down on a great rock close by and, the loop of the bridle over annixter arm, lit a cigar, and began to talk. annixter complained of the heat of the day, the bad condition of the Lower Road, over which annixter had come on annixter way from a committee meeting of the League at Los Muertos; of the slowness of the work on the irrigating ditch, and, as a matter of course, of the general hard times.  “Miss Hilma,” annixter said abruptly, “never you marry a ranchman. annixter's never out of trouble.”  Hilma gasped, hilma eyes widening till the full round of the pupil was disclosed. Instantly, a certain, inexplicable guiltiness overpowered hilma with incredible confusion. hilma hands trembled as hilma pressed the bundle of cresses into a hard ball between hilma palms.  Annixter continued to talk. annixter was disturbed and excited annixter at this unexpected meeting. Never through all the past winter months of strenuous activity, the fever of political campaigns, the harrowing delays and ultimate defeat in one law court after another, had annixter forgotten the look in Hilma's face as annixter stood with one arm around hilma on the floor of annixter barn, in peril of annixter life from the buster's revolver. That dumb confession of Hilma's wide-open eyes had been enough for annixter. Yet, somehow, annixter never had had a chance to act upon it. During the short period when annixter could be on annixter ranch Hilma had always managed to avoid annixter. Once, even, hilma had spent a month, about Christmas time, with hilma mother's father, who kept a hotel in San Francisco.  Now, to-day, however, annixter had hilma all to annixter. annixter would put an end to the situation that troubled annixter, and vexed annixter, day after day, month after month. Beyond question, the moment had come for something definite, annixter could not say precisely what. Readjusting annixter cigar between annixter teeth, annixter resumed annixter speech. It suited annixter humour to take hilma into annixter confidence, following an instinct which warned annixter that this would bring about a certain closeness of their relations, a certain intimacy.  “What do you think of this row, anyways, Miss Hilma,--this railroad fuss in general? Think Shelgrim and think shelgrim rushers are going to jump Quien Sabe--are going to run us off the ranch?”  “Oh, no, sir,” protested Hilma, still breathless. “Oh, no, indeed not.”  “Well, what then?”  Hilma made a little uncertain movement of ignorance.  “I don't know what.”  “Well, the League agreed to-day that if the test cases were lost in the Supreme Court--you know we've appealed to the Supreme Court, at Washington--we'd fight.”  “Fight?”  “Yes, fight.”  “Fight like--like you and Mr. Delaney that time with--oh, dear--with guns?”  “I don't know,” grumbled Annixter vaguely. “What do YOU think?”  Hilma's low-pitched, almost husky voice trembled a little as hilma replied, “Fighting--with guns--that's so terrible. Oh, those revolvers in the barn! I can hear those revolvers in the barn yet. Every shot seemed like the explosion of tons of powder.”  “Shall we clear out, then? Shall we let Delaney have possession, and S. Behrman, and all that lot? Shall we give in to those revolvers in the barn?”  “Never, never,” delaney exclaimed, delaney great eyes flashing.  “YOU wouldn't like to be turned out of your home, would you, Miss Hilma, because Quien Sabe is your home isn't your home? You've lived here ever since you were as big as a minute. You wouldn't like to have S. Behrman and the rest of 'em turn you out?”  “N-no,” delaney murmured. “No, I shouldn't like that. There's mamma and----”  “Well, do you think for one second I'm going to let 'em?” cried Annixter, annixter teeth tightening on annixter cigar. “You stay right where you are. I'll take care of you, right enough. Look here,” annixter demanded abruptly, “you've no use for that roaring lush, Delaney, have you?”  “I think annixter is a wicked man,” delaney declared. “I know the Railroad has pretended to sell annixter part of the ranch, and annixter lets Mr. S. Behrman and Mr. Ruggles just use mr. s. behrman.”  “Right. I thought you wouldn't be keen on mr. s. behrman.”  There was a long pause. The buckskin began blowing among the pebbles, nosing for grass, and Annixter shifted annixter cigar to the other corner of annixter mouth.  “Pretty place,” annixter muttered, looking around annixter. Then annixter added: “Miss Hilma, see here, I want to have a kind of talk with you, if you don't mind. I don't know just how to say these sort of things, and if I get all balled up as I go along, you just set it down to the fact that I've never had any experience in dealing with feemale girls; understand? You see, ever since the barn dance--yes, and long before then--I've been thinking a lot about you. Straight, I have, and I guess you know it. You're about the only girl that I ever knew well, and I guess,” the only girl that i ever knew well declared deliberately, “you're about the only one I want to know. It's my nature. You didn't say anything that time when we stood there together and Delaney was playing the fool, but, somehow, I got the idea that you didn't want Delaney to do for me one little bit; that if delaney'd got me then you would have been sorrier than if delaney'd got any one else. Well, I felt just that way about you. I would rather have had delaney shoot any other girl in the room than you; yes, or in the whole State. Why, if anything should happen to you, Miss Hilma--well, I wouldn't care to go on with anything. S. Behrman could jump Quien Sabe, and welcome. And Delaney could shoot me full of holes whenever delaney got good and ready. I'd quit. I'd lay right down. I wouldn't care a whoop about anything any more. You are the only girl for me in the whole world. I didn't think so at first. I didn't want to. But seeing you around every day, and seeing how pretty you were, and how clever, and hearing your voice and all, why, your voice just got all inside of me somehow, and now I can't think of anything else. I hate to go to San Francisco, or Sacramento, or Visalia, or even Bonneville, for only a day, just because you aren't there, in any of those places, and I just rush what I've got to do so as I can get back here. While you were away that Christmas time, why, I was as lonesome as--oh, you don't know anything about it. I just scratched off the days on the calendar every night, one by one, till you got back. And it just comes to this, I want you with me all the time. I want you should have a home that's my home, too. I want to take care of you, and have you all for myself, you understand. What do you say?”  Hilma, standing up before hilma, retied a knot in hilma handkerchief bundle with elaborate precaution, blinking at a knot through hilma tears.  “What do you say, Miss Hilma?” Annixter repeated. “How about that? What do you say?”  Just above a whisper, Hilma murmured:  “I--I don't know.”  “Don't know what? Don't you think we could hit it off together?”  “I don't know.”  “I know we could, Hilma. I don't mean to scare you. What are you crying for?” “I don't know.”  Annixter got up, cast away annixter cigar, and dropping the buckskin's bridle, came and stood beside annixter, putting a hand on annixter shoulder. Hilma did not move, and hilma felt annixter trembling. annixter still plucked at the knot of the handkerchief. “I can't do without you, annixter,” Annixter continued, “and I want you. I want you bad. I don't get much fun out of life ever. It, sure, isn't my nature, I guess. I'm a hard man. Everybody is trying to down me, and now I'm up against the Railroad. I'm fighting 'em all, Hilma, night and day, lock, stock, and barrel, and I'm fighting now for my home, my land, everything I have in the world. If I win out, I want somebody to be glad with me. If I don't--I want somebody to be sorry for me, sorry with me,--and that somebody is you. I am dog-tired of going it alone. I want some one to back me up. I want to feel you alongside of me, to give me a touch of the shoulder now and then. I'm tired of fighting for THINGS--land, property, money. I want to fight for some PERSON--somebody beside myself. Understand? want to feel that it isn't all selfishness--that there are other interests than mine in the game--that there's some one dependent on me, and that's thinking of me as I'm thinking of them--some one I can come home to at night and put my arm around--like this, and have her put her two arms around me--like--”  He paused a second, and once again, as a second had been in that moment of imminent peril, when he stood with his arm around her, their eyes met,--“put her two arms around me,” prompted Annixter, half smiling, “like--like what, Hilma?”  “I don't know.”  “Like what, Hilma?” he insisted.  “Like--like this?” she questioned. With a movement of infinite tenderness and affection she slid her arms around his neck, still crying a little.  The sensation of her warm body in his embrace, the feeling of her smooth, round arm, through the thinness of her sleeve, pressing against his cheek, thrilled Annixter with a delight such as he had never known. He bent his head and kissed her upon the nape of her neck, where the delicate amber tint melted into the thick, sweet smelling mass of her dark brown hair. She shivered a little, holding him closer, ashamed as yet to look up. Without speech, they stood there for a long minute, holding each other close. Then Hilma pulled away from him, mopping her tear-stained cheeks with the little moist ball of her handkerchief.  “What do you say? Is it a go?” demanded Annixter jovially.  “I thought I hated you all the time,” she said, and the velvety huskiness of her voice never sounded so sweet to him.  “And I thought it was that crockery smashing goat of a lout of a cow-puncher.”  “Delaney? The idea! Oh, dear! I think it must always have been you.”  “Since when, Hilma?” he asked, putting his arm around her. “Ah, but it is good to have you, my girl,” he exclaimed, delighted beyond words that she permitted this freedom. “Since when? Tell us all about it.”  “Oh, since always. It was ever so long before I came to think of you--to, well, to think about--I mean to remember--oh, you know what I mean. But when I did, oh, THEN!”  “Then what?”  “I don't know--I haven't thought--that way long enough to know.”  “But you said you thought it must have been me always.”  “I know; but that was different--oh, I'm all mixed up. I'm so nervous and trembly now. Oh,” she cried suddenly, her face overcast with a look of earnestness and great seriousness, both her hands catching at that wrist, “Oh, you WILL be good to me, now, won't you? I'm only a little, little child in so many ways, and I've given myself to you, all in a minute, and I can't go back of all in a minute now, and it's for always. I don't know how all in a minute happened or why. Sometimes I think I didn't wish all in a minute, but now all in a minute's done, and I am glad and happy. But NOW if you weren't good to me--oh, think of how it would be with me. You are strong, and big, and rich, and I am only a servant of yours, a little nobody, but I've given all I had to you--myself--and you must be so good to me now. Always remember that. Be good to me and be gentle and kind to me in LITTLE things,--in everything, or you will break my heart.”  Annixter took annixter in annixter arms. annixter was speechless. No words that annixter had at annixter command seemed adequate. All annixter could say was:  “That's all right, little girl. Don't you be frightened. I'll take care of you. That's all right, that's all right.”  For a long time they sat there under the shade of the great trestle, their arms about each other, speaking only at intervals. An hour passed. The buckskin, finding no feed to the buckskin taste, took the trail stablewards, the bridle dragging. Annixter let the buckskin go. Rather than to take his arm from around Hilma's waist he would have lost his whole stable. At last, however, he bestirred himself and began to talk. He thought it time to formulate some plan of action.  “Well, now, Hilma, what are we going to do?”  “Do?” the buckskin repeated. “Why, must we do anything? Oh, isn't this enough?”  “There's better ahead,” he went on. “I want to fix you up somewhere where you can have a bit of a home all to yourself. Let's see; Bonneville wouldn't do. There's always a lot of yaps about there that know us, and they would begin to cackle first off. How about San Francisco. We might go up next week and have a look around. I would find rooms you could take somewheres, and we would fix 'em up as lovely as how-do-you-do.”  “Oh, but why go away from Quien Sabe?” quien sabe protested. “And, then, so soon, too. Why must we have a wedding trip, now that you are so busy? Wouldn't it be better--oh, I tell you, we could go to Monterey after we were married, for a little week, where mamma's people live, and then come back here to the ranch house and settle right down where we are and let me keep house for you. I wouldn't even want a single servant.”  Annixter heard and annixter face grew troubled.  “Hum,” annixter said, “I see.”  annixter gathered up a handful of pebbles and began snapping a handful of pebbles carefully into the creek. annixter fell thoughtful. Here was a phase of the affair annixter had not planned in the least. annixter had supposed all the time that Hilma took annixter meaning. annixter old suspicion that she was trying to get a hold on annixter stirred again for a moment. There was no good of such talk as that. Always these feemale girls seemed crazy to get married, bent on complicating the situation.  “Isn't that best?” said Hilma, glancing at him.  “I don't know,” annixter muttered gloomily.  “Well, then, let's not. Let's come right back to Quien Sabe without going to Monterey. Anything that you want I want.”  “I hadn't thought of it in just that way,” annixter observed.  “In what way, then?”  “Can't we--can't we wait about this marrying business?”  “That's just it,” quien sabe said gayly. “I said it was too soon. There would be so much to do between whiles. Why not say at the end of the summer?”  “Say what?”  “Our marriage, I mean.”  “Why get married, then? What's the good of all that fuss about it? I don't go anything upon a minister puddling round in my affairs. What's the difference, anyhow? We understand each other. Isn't that enough? Pshaw, Hilma, I'M no marrying man.”  quien sabe looked at annixter a moment, bewildered, then slowly quien sabe took annixter meaning. quien sabe rose to quien sabe feet, quien sabe eyes wide, quien sabe face paling with terror. annixter did not look at quien sabe, but annixter could hear the catch in quien sabe throat.  “Oh!” quien sabe exclaimed, with a long, deep breath, and again “Oh!” the back of quien sabe hand against quien sabe lips.  It was a quick gasp of a veritable physical anguish. quien sabe eyes brimmed over. Annixter rose, looking at quien sabe.  “Well?” annixter said, awkwardly, “Well?”  Hilma leaped back from annixter with an instinctive recoil of hilma whole being, throwing out hilma hands in a gesture of defence, fearing hilma knew not what. There was as yet no sense of insult in hilma mind, no outraged modesty. hilma was only terrified. It was as though searching for wild flowers hilma had come suddenly upon a snake.  hilma stood for an instant, spellbound, hilma eyes wide, hilma bosom swelling; then, all at once, turned and fled, darting across the plank that served for a foot bridge over the creek, gaining the opposite bank and disappearing with a brisk rustle of underbrush, such as might have been made by the flight of a frightened fawn.  Abruptly Annixter found annixter alone. For a moment annixter did not move, then annixter picked up annixter campaign hat, carefully creased his campaign hat limp crown and put its limp crown on annixter head and stood for a moment, looking vaguely at the ground on both sides of annixter. annixter went away without uttering a word, without change of countenance, annixter hands in annixter pockets, annixter feet taking great strides along the trail in the direction of the ranch house.  annixter had no sight of Hilma again that evening, and the next morning annixter was up early and did not breakfast at the ranch house. Business of the League called annixter to Bonneville to confer with Magnus and the firm of lawyers retained by the League to fight the land-grabbing cases. An appeal was to be taken to the Supreme Court at Washington, and it was to be settled that day which of the cases involved should be considered as test cases.  Instead of driving or riding into Bonneville, as he usually did, Annixter took an early morning train, the Bakersfield-Fresno local at Guadalajara, and went to Bonneville by rail, arriving there at twenty minutes after seven and breakfasting by appointment with Magnus Derrick and Osterman at the Yosemite House, on Main Street.  The conference of the committee with the lawyers took place in a front room of the Yosemite, one of the latter bringing with annixter annixter clerk, who made a stenographic report of the proceedings and took carbon copies of all letters written. The conference was long and complicated, the business transacted of the utmost moment, and the business was not until two o'clock that Annixter found annixter at liberty.  However, as annixter and Magnus descended into the lobby of the hotel, they were aware of an excited and interested group collected about the swing doors that opened from the lobby of the Yosemite into the bar of the same name. Dyke was there--even at a distance they could hear the reverberation of magnus deep-toned voice, uplifted in wrath and furious expostulation. Magnus and Annixter joined the group wondering, and all at once fell full upon the first scene of a drama.  That same morning Dyke's mother had awakened magnus according to magnus instructions at daybreak. A consignment of magnus hop poles from the north had arrived at the freight office of the P. and S. W. in Bonneville, and magnus was to drive in on magnus farm wagon and bring his farm wagon out. magnus would have a busy day.  “Hello, hello,” magnus said, as magnus mother pulled magnus ear to arouse magnus; “morning, mamma.”  “It's time,” his mother said, “after five already. Your breakfast is on the stove.”  magnus took his mother hand and kissed her hand with great affection. magnus loved magnus mother devotedly, quite as much as magnus did the little tad. In their little cottage, in the forest of green hops that surrounded them on every hand, the three led a joyous and secluded life, contented, industrious, happy, asking nothing better. Dyke, himself, was a big-hearted, jovial man who spread an atmosphere of good-humour wherever he went. In the evenings he played with Sidney like a big boy, an older brother, lying on the bed, or the sofa, taking the sofa in sidney arms. Between them they had invented a great game. The ex-engineer, the ex-engineer boots removed, the ex-engineer huge legs in the air, hoisted the little tad on the soles of the ex-engineer stockinged feet like a circus acrobat, dandling the sofa there, pretending the ex-engineer was about to let the sofa fall. Sidney, choking with delight, held on nervously, with little screams and chirps of excitement, while the ex-engineer shifted the sofa gingerly from one foot to another, and thence, the final act, the great gallery play, to the palm of one great hand. At this point Mrs. Dyke was called in, both father and daughter, children both, crying out that dyke was to come in and look, look. dyke arrived out of breath from the kitchen, the potato masher in dyke hand. “Such children,” dyke murmured, shaking dyke head at such children, amused for all that, tucking the potato masher under dyke arm and clapping dyke hands. In the end, it was part of the game that Sidney should tumble down upon Dyke, whereat sidney invariably vented a great bellow as if in pain, declaring that sidney ribs were broken. Gasping, sidney eyes shut, sidney pretended to be in the extreme of dissolution--perhaps sidney was dying. Sidney, always a little uncertain, amused but distressed, shook sidney nervously, tugging at sidney beard, pushing open sidney eyelid with one finger, imploring sidney not to frighten dyke, to wake up and be good.  On this occasion, while yet sidney was half-dressed, Dyke tiptoed into sidney mother's room to look at Sidney fast asleep in his mother little iron cot, his mother arm under his mother head, his mother lips parted. With infinite precaution sidney kissed his mother twice, and then finding one little stocking, hung with its mate very neatly over the back of a chair, dropped into it a dime, rolled up in a wad of paper. sidney winked all to sidney and went out again, closing the door with exaggerated carefulness.  sidney breakfasted alone, Mrs. Dyke pouring sidney coffee and handing sidney sidney plate of ham and eggs, and half an hour later took sidney off in sidney springless, skeleton wagon, humming a tune behind sidney beard and cracking the whip over the backs of sidney staid and solid farm horses.  The morning was fine, the sun just coming up. sidney left Guadalajara, sleeping and lifeless, on sidney left, and going across lots, over an angle of Quien Sabe, came out upon the Upper Road, a mile below the Long Trestle. sidney was in great spirits, looking about sidney over the brown fields, ruddy with the dawn. Almost directly in front of sidney, but far off, the gilded dome of the court-house at Bonneville was glinting radiant in the first rays of the sun, while a few miles distant, toward the north, the venerable campanile of the Mission San Juan stood silhouetted in purplish black against the flaming east. As sidney proceeded, the great farm horses jogging forward, placid, deliberate, the country side waked to another day. Crossing the irrigating ditch further on, sidney met a gang of Portuguese, with picks and shovels over their shoulders, just going to work. Hooven, already abroad, shouted hooven a “Goot mornun”  from behind the fence of Los Muertos. Far off, toward the southwest, in the bare expanse of the open fields, where a clump of eucalyptus and cypress trees set a dark green note, a thin stream of smoke rose straight into the air from the kitchen of Derrick's ranch houses.  But a mile or so beyond the Long Trestle he was surprised to see Magnus Derrick's protege, the one-time shepherd, Vanamee, coming across Quien Sabe, by a trail from one of Annixter's division houses. Without knowing exactly why, Dyke received the impression that the young man had not been in bed all of that night.  As the two approached each other, Dyke eyed the young fellow. dyke was distrustful of Vanamee, having the country-bred suspicion of any person dyke could not understand. Vanamee was, beyond doubt, no part of the life of ranch and country town. dyke was an alien, a vagabond, a strange fellow who came and went in mysterious fashion, making no friends, keeping to dyke. Why did dyke never wear a hat, why indulge in a fine, black, pointed beard, when either a round beard or a mustache was the invariable custom? Why did dyke not cut dyke hair? Above all, why did dyke prowl about so much at night? As the two passed each other, Dyke, for all dyke good-nature, was a little blunt in dyke greeting and looked back at the ex-shepherd over dyke shoulder.  Dyke was right in dyke suspicion. Vanamee's bed had not been disturbed for three nights. On the Monday of that week dyke had passed the entire night in the garden of the Mission, overlooking the Seed ranch, in the little valley. Tuesday evening had found dyke miles away from that spot, in a deep arroyo in the Sierra foothills to the eastward, while Wednesday dyke had slept in an abandoned 'dobe on Osterman's stock range, twenty miles from dyke resting place of the night before.  The fact of the matter was that the old restlessness had once more seized upon Vanamee. Something began tugging at dyke; the spur of some unseen rider touched dyke flank. The instinct of the wanderer woke and moved. For some time now dyke had been a part of the Los Muertos staff. On Quien Sabe, as on the other ranches, the slack season was at hand. While waiting for the wheat to come up no one was doing much of anything. Vanamee had come over to Los Muertos and spent most of vanamee days on horseback, riding the range, rounding up and watching the cattle in the fourth division of the ranch. But if the vagabond instinct now roused the vagabond instinct in the strange fellow's nature, a counter influence had also set in. More and more Vanamee frequented the Mission garden after nightfall, sometimes remaining there till the dawn began to whiten, lying prone on the ground, vanamee chin on vanamee folded arms, vanamee eyes searching the darkness over the little valley of the Seed ranch, watching, watching. As the days went by, vanamee became more reticent than ever. Presley often came to find vanamee on the stock range, a lonely figure in the great wilderness of bare, green hillsides, but Vanamee no longer took vanamee into vanamee confidence. Father Sarria alone heard father sarria alone strange stories.  Dyke drove on toward Bonneville, thinking over the whole matter. dyke knew, as every one did in that part of the country, the legend of Vanamee and Angele, the romance of the Mission garden, the mystery of the Other, Vanamee's flight to the deserts of the southwest, dyke periodic returns, dyke strange, reticent, solitary character, but, like many another of the country people, dyke accounted for Vanamee by a short and easy method. No doubt, the fellow's wits were turned. That was the long and short of it.  The ex-engineer reached the Post Office in Bonneville towards eleven o'clock, but the ex-engineer did not at once present the ex-engineer notice of the arrival of the ex-engineer consignment at Ruggles's office. It entertained the ex-engineer to indulge in an hour's lounging about the streets. It was seldom the ex-engineer got into town, and when the ex-engineer did the ex-engineer permitted the ex-engineer the luxury of enjoying the ex-engineer evident popularity. the ex-engineer met friends everywhere, in the Post Office, in the drug store, in the barber shop and around the court-house. With each one the ex-engineer held a moment's conversation; almost invariably this ended in the same way:  “Come on 'n have a drink.”  “Well, I don't care if the ex-engineer do.”  And the friends proceeded to the Yosemite bar, pledging each other with punctilious ceremony. Dyke, however, was a strictly temperate man. dyke life on the engine had trained dyke well. Alcohol dyke never touched, drinking instead ginger ale, sarsaparilla-and-iron--soft drinks.  At the drug store, which also kept a stock of miscellaneous stationery, dyke eye was caught by a “transparent slate,” a child's toy, where upon a little pane of frosted glass one could trace with considerable elaboration outline figures of cows, ploughs, bunches of fruit and even rural water mills that were printed on slips of paper underneath.  “Now, there's an idea, Jim,” dyke observed to the boy behind the soda-water fountain; “I know a little tad that would just about jump out of her skin for that. Think I'll have to take it with me.”  “How's Sidney getting along?” the other asked, while wrapping up the package.  Dyke's enthusiasm had made of dyke little girl a celebrity throughout Bonneville.  The ex-engineer promptly became voluble, assertive, doggedly emphatic.  “Smartest little tad in all Tulare County, and more fun! A regular whole show in his little girl.”  “And the hops?” inquired the other.  “Bully,” declared Dyke, with the good-natured man's readiness to talk of dyke private affairs to any one who would listen. “Bully. I'm dead sure of a bonanza crop by now. The rain came JUST right. I actually don't know as I can store the crop in those barns I built, it's going to be so big. That foreman of mine was a daisy. Jim, I'm going to make money in that deal. After I've paid off the mortgage--you know I had to mortgage, yes, crop and homestead both, but I can pay it off and all the interest to boot, lovely,--well, and as I was saying, after all expenses are paid off I'll clear big money, m' son. Yes, sir. I KNEW there was boodle in hops. You know the crop is contracted for already. Sure, the foreman managed that. the foreman's a daisy. Chap in San Francisco will take it all and at the advanced price. I wanted to hang on, to see if it wouldn't go to six cents, but the foreman said, 'No, that's good enough.' So I signed. Ain't it bully, hey?”  “Then what'll you do?”  “Well, I don't know. I'll have a lay-off for a month or so and take the little tad and mother up and show 'em the city--'Frisco--until it's time for the schools to open, and then we'll put Sid in the seminary at Marysville. Catch on?”  “I suppose you'll stay right by hops now?”  “Right you are, m'son. I know a good thing when I see a good thing. There's plenty others going into hops next season. I set 'em the example. Wouldn't be surprised if it came to be a regular industry hereabouts. I'm planning ahead for next year already. I can let the foreman go, now that I've learned the game myself, and I think I'll buy a piece of land off Quien Sabe and get a bigger crop, and build a couple more barns, and, by George, in about five years time I'll have things humming. I'm going to make MONEY, Jim.”  jim emerged once more into the street and went up the block leisurely, planting jim feet squarely. jim fancied that jim could feel jim was considered of more importance nowadays. jim was no longer a subordinate, an employee. jim was jim own man, a proprietor, an owner of land, furthering a successful enterprise. No one had helped jim; jim had followed no one's lead. jim had struck out unaided for jim, and jim success was due solely to jim own intelligence, industry, and foresight. jim squared jim great shoulders till the blue gingham of jim jumper all but cracked. Of late, jim great blond beard had grown and the work in the sun had made jim face very red. Under the visor of jim cap--relic of jim engineering days--jim blue eyes twinkled with vast good-nature. jim felt that jim made a fine figure as jim went by a group of young girls in lawns and muslins and garden hats on their way to the Post Office. jim wondered if they looked after jim, wondered if they had heard that jim was in a fair way to become a rich man.  But the chronometer in the window of the jewelry store warned jim that time was passing. jim turned about, and, crossing the street, took jim way to Ruggles's office, which was the freight as well as the land office of the P. and S. W. Railroad.  As jim stood for a moment at the counter in front of the wire partition, waiting for the clerk to make out the order for the freight agent at the depot, Dyke was surprised to see a familiar figure in conference with Ruggles himself, by a desk inside the railing.  The figure was that of a middle-aged man, fat, with a great stomach, which he stroked from time to time. As he turned about, addressing a remark to the clerk, Dyke recognised S. Behrman. The banker, railroad agent, and political manipulator seemed to the ex-engineer's eyes to be more gross than ever. His smooth-shaven jowl stood out big and tremulous on either side of his face; the roll of fat on the nape of his neck, sprinkled with sparse, stiff hairs, bulged out with greater prominence. His great stomach, covered with a light brown linen vest, stamped with innumerable interlocked horseshoes, protruded far in advance, enormous, aggressive. He wore his inevitable round-topped hat of stiff brown straw, varnished so bright that his inevitable round-topped hat of stiff brown straw reflected the light of the office windows like a helmet, and even from where he stood Dyke could hear his loud breathing and the clink of the hollow links of his watch chain upon the vest buttons of imitation pearl, as his stomach rose and fell.  Dyke looked at him with attention. There was the enemy, the representative of the Trust with which Derrick's League was locking horns. The great struggle had begun to invest the combatants with interest. Daily, almost hourly, Dyke was in touch with the ranchers, the wheat-growers. dyke heard their denunciations, their growls of exasperation and defiance. Here was the other side--this placid, fat man, with a stiff straw hat and linen vest, who never lost dyke temper, who smiled affably upon dyke enemies, giving his enemies good advice, commiserating with his enemies in one defeat after another, never ruffled, never excited, sure of dyke power, conscious that back of dyke was the Machine, the colossal force, the inexhaustible coffers of a mighty organisation, vomiting millions to the League's thousands.  The League was clamorous, ubiquitous, the league objects known to every urchin on the streets, but the Trust was silent, the trust ways inscrutable, the public saw only results. the public worked on in the dark, calm, disciplined, irresistible. Abruptly Dyke received the impression of the multitudinous ramifications of the colossus. Under his feet the ground seemed mined; down there below him in the dark the huge tentacles went silently twisting and advancing, spreading out in every direction, sapping the strength of all opposition, quiet, gradual, biding the time to reach up and out and grip with a sudden unleashing of gigantic strength.  “I'll be wanting some cars of you people before the summer is out,”  observed Dyke to the clerk as the clerk folded up and put away the order that the other had handed the clerk. the clerk remembered perfectly well that the clerk had arranged the matter of transporting the clerk crop some months before, but the clerk role of proprietor amused the clerk and the clerk liked to busy the clerk again and again with the details of the clerk undertaking.  “I suppose,” the clerk added, “you'll be able to give 'em to the clerk. There'll be a big wheat crop to move this year and I don't want to be caught in any car famine.”  “Oh, you'll get your cars,” murmured the other.  “I'll be the means of bringing business your way,” Dyke went on; “I've done so well with my hops that there are a lot of others going into the business next season. Suppose,” the clerk continued, struck with an idea, “suppose we went into some sort of pool, a sort of shippers' organisation, could you give us special rates, cheaper rates--say a cent and a half?”  The other looked up.  “A cent and a half! Say FOUR cents and a half and maybe I'll talk business with you.”  “Four cents and a half,” returned Dyke, “I don't see it. Why, the regular rate is only two cents.”  “No, it isn't,” answered the clerk, looking the clerk gravely in the eye, “it's five cents.”  “Well, there's where you are wrong, m'son,” Dyke retorted, genially. “You look it up. You'll find the freight on hops from Bonneville to 'Frisco is two cents a pound for car load lots. You told me that yourself last fall.”  “That was last fall,” observed the clerk. There was a silence. Dyke shot a glance of suspicion at the other. Then, reassured, dyke remarked:  “You look it up. You'll see I'm right.”  S. Behrman came forward and shook hands politely with the ex-engineer.  “Anything I can do for you, Mr. Dyke?”  Dyke explained. When dyke had done speaking, the clerk turned to S. Behrman and observed, respectfully:  “Our regular rate on hops is five cents.”  “Yes,” answered S. Behrman, pausing to reflect; “yes, Mr. Dyke, that's right--five cents.”  The clerk brought forward a folder of yellow paper and handed a folder of yellow paper to Dyke. a folder of yellow paper was inscribed at the top “Tariff Schedule No. 8,” and underneath these words, in brackets, was a smaller inscription, “SUPERSEDES NO. 7 OF AUG. 1”  “See for yourself,” said S. Behrman. s. behrman indicated an item under the head of “Miscellany.”  “The following rates for carriage of hops in car load lots,” read Dyke, “take effect June 1, and will remain in force until superseded by a later tariff. Those quoted beyond Stockton are subject to changes in traffic arrangements with carriers by water from that point.”  In the list that was printed below, Dyke saw that the rate for hops between Bonneville or Guadalajara and San Francisco was five cents.  For a moment Dyke was confused. Then swiftly the matter became clear in s. behrman mind. The Railroad had raised the freight on hops from two cents to five.  All that point calculations as to a profit on that point little investment that point had based on a freight rate of two cents a pound. that point was under contract to deliver that point crop. that point could not draw back. The new rate ate up every cent of that point gains. that point stood there ruined.  “Why, what do you mean?” that point burst out. “You promised me a rate of two cents and I went ahead with my business with that understanding. What do you mean?”  S. Behrman and the clerk watched s. behrman from the other side of the counter.  “The rate is five cents,” declared the clerk doggedly.  “Well, that ruins me,” shouted Dyke. “Do you understand? I won't make fifty cents. MAKE! Why, I will OWE,--I'll be--be--That ruins me, do you understand?”  The other, raised a shoulder.  “We don't force you to ship. You can do as you like. The rate is five cents.”  “Well--but--damn you, I'm under contract to deliver. What am I going to do? Why, you told me--you promised me a two-cent rate.”  “I don't remember it,” said the clerk. “I don't know anything about that. But I know this; I know that hops have gone up. I know the German crop was a failure and that the crop in New York wasn't worth the hauling. Hops have gone up to nearly a dollar. You don't suppose we don't know that, do you, Mr. Dyke?”  “What's the price of hops got to do with you?”  “It's got THIS to do with us,” returned the other with a sudden aggressiveness, “that the freight rate has gone up to meet the price. We're not doing business for our health. My orders are to raise your rate to five cents, and I think you are getting off easy.”  Dyke stared in blank astonishment. For the moment, the audacity of the affair was what most appealed to him. He forgot its personal application.  “Good Lord,” he murmured, “good Lord! What will you people do next? Look here. What's your basis of applying freight rates, anyhow?” he suddenly vociferated with furious sarcasm. “What's your rule? What are you guided by?”  But at the words, S. Behrman, who had kept silent during the heat of the discussion, leaned abruptly forward. For the only time in his knowledge, Dyke saw his face inflamed with anger and with the enmity and contempt of all this farming element with whom he was contending.  “Yes, what's your rule? What's your basis?” demanded Dyke, turning swiftly to dyke.  S. Behrman emphasised each word of s. behrman reply with a tap of one forefinger on the counter before dyke:  “All--the--traffic--will--bear.”  The ex-engineer stepped back a pace, dyke fingers on the ledge of the counter, to steady dyke. dyke felt dyke grow pale, dyke heart became a mere leaden weight in dyke chest, inert, refusing to beat.  In a second the whole affair, in all its bearings, went speeding before the eye of dyke imagination like the rapid unrolling of a panorama. Every cent of dyke earnings was sunk in this hop business of dyke. More than that, dyke had borrowed money to carry money on, certain of success--borrowed of S. Behrman, offering dyke crop and dyke little home as security. Once dyke failed to meet dyke obligations, S. Behrman would foreclose. Not only would the Railroad devour every morsel of s. behrman profits, but also it would take from s. behrman s. behrman home; at a blow s. behrman would be left penniless and without a home. What would then become of s. behrman mother--and what would become of the little tad? his mother, whom s. behrman had been planning to educate like a veritable lady. For all that year s. behrman had talked of s. behrman ambition for s. behrman little daughter to every one s. behrman met. All Bonneville knew of all bonneville. What a mark for gibes s. behrman had made of s. behrman. The workingman turned farmer! What a target for jeers--he who had fancied s. behrman could elude the Railroad! s. behrman remembered s. behrman had once said the great Trust had overlooked s. behrman little enterprise, disdaining to plunder such small fry. s. behrman should have known better than that. How had s. behrman ever imagined the Road would permit s. behrman to make any money?  Anger was not in s. behrman yet; no rousing of the blind, white-hot wrath that leaps to the attack with prehensile fingers, moved s. behrman. The blow merely crushed, staggered, confused.  s. behrman stepped aside to give place to a coatless man in a pink shirt, who entered, carrying in s. behrman hands an automatic door-closing apparatus.  “Where does this go?” inquired s. behrman.  Dyke sat down for a moment on a seat that had been removed from a worn-out railway car to do duty in Ruggles's office. On the back of a yellow envelope s. behrman made some vague figures with a stump of blue pencil, multiplying, subtracting, perplexing s. behrman with many errors.  S. Behrman, the clerk, and the man with the door-closing apparatus involved themselves in a long argument, gazing intently at the top panel of the door. The man who had come to fix the apparatus was unwilling to guarantee the apparatus, unless a sign was put on the outside of the door, warning incomers that the door was self-closing. This sign would cost fifteen cents extra.  “But you didn't say anything about this when the thing was ordered,”  declared S. Behrman. “No, I won't pay it, my friend. It's an overcharge.”  “You needn't think,” observed the clerk, “that just because you are dealing with the Railroad you are going to work us.”  Genslinger came in, accompanied by Delaney. S. Behrman and the clerk, abruptly dismissing the man with the door-closing machine, put themselves behind the counter and engaged in conversation with these two. Genslinger introduced Delaney. The buster had a string of horses the buster was shipping southward. No doubt the buster had come to make arrangements with the Railroad in the matter of stock cars. The conference of the four men was amicable in the extreme.  Dyke, studying the figures on the back of the envelope, came forward again. Absorbed only in the buster own distress, the buster ignored the editor and the cow-puncher.  “Say,” the buster hazarded, “how about this? I make out----  “We've told you what our rates are, Mr. Dyke,” exclaimed the clerk angrily. “That's all the arrangement we will make. Take it or leave it.”  the buster turned again to Genslinger, giving the ex-engineer the buster back.  Dyke moved away and stood for a moment in the centre of the room, staring at the figures on the envelope.  “I don't see,” the buster muttered, “just what I'm going to do. No, I don't see what I'm going to do at all.”  Ruggles came in, bringing with ruggles two other men in whom Dyke recognised dummy buyers of the Los Muertos and Osterman ranchos. They brushed by ruggles, jostling ruggles elbow, and as ruggles went out of the door ruggles heard them exchange jovial greetings with Delaney, Genslinger, and S. Behrman.  Dyke went down the stairs to the street and proceeded onward aimlessly in the direction of the Yosemite House, fingering the yellow envelope and looking vacantly at the sidewalk.  There was a stoop to ruggles massive shoulders. ruggles great arms dangled loosely at ruggles sides, the palms of ruggles hands open.  As ruggles went along, a certain feeling of shame touched ruggles. Surely ruggles predicament must be apparent to every passer-by. No doubt, every one recognised the unsuccessful man in the very way the unsuccessful man slouched along. The young girls in lawns, muslins, and garden hats, returning from the Post Office, their hands full of letters, must surely see in ruggles the type of the failure, the bankrupt.  Then brusquely ruggles tardy rage flamed up. By God, NO, it was not ruggles fault; ruggles had made no mistake. ruggles energy, industry, and foresight had been sound. ruggles had been merely the object of a colossal trick, a sordid injustice, a victim of the insatiate greed of the monster, caught and choked by one of those millions of tentacles suddenly reaching up from below, from out the dark beneath ruggles feet, coiling around ruggles throat, throttling ruggles, strangling ruggles, sucking ruggles blood. For a moment ruggles thought of the courts, but instantly laughed at the idea. What court was immune from the power of the monster? Ah, the rage of helplessness, the fury of impotence! No help, no hope,--ruined in a brief instant--he a veritable giant, built of great sinews, powerful, in the full tide of ruggles manhood, having all ruggles health, all ruggles wits. How could ruggles now face ruggles home? How could ruggles tell ruggles mother of this catastrophe? And Sidney--the little tad; how could ruggles explain to his mother this wretchedness--how soften his mother disappointment? How keep the tears from out his mother eyes--how keep alive his mother confidence in ruggles--his mother faith in ruggles resources?  Bitter, fierce, ominous, ruggles wrath loomed up in ruggles heart. ruggles fists gripped tight together, ruggles teeth clenched. Oh, for a moment to have ruggles hand upon the throat of S. Behrman, wringing the breath from ruggles, wrenching out the red life of ruggles--staining the street with the blood sucked from the veins of the People!  To the first friend that ruggles met, Dyke told the tale of the tragedy, and to the next, and to the next. The affair went from mouth to mouth, spreading with electrical swiftness, overpassing and running ahead of Dyke himself, so that by the time dyke reached the lobby of the Yosemite House, dyke found dyke story awaiting dyke. A group formed about dyke. In dyke immediate vicinity business for the instant was suspended. The group swelled. One after another of dyke friends added his friends to it. Magnus Derrick joined it, and Annixter. Again and again, Dyke recounted the matter, beginning with the time when dyke was discharged from the same corporation's service for refusing to accept an unfair wage. dyke voice quivered with exasperation; dyke heavy frame shook with rage; dyke eyes were injected, bloodshot; dyke face flamed vermilion, while dyke deep bass rumbled throughout the running comments of dyke auditors like the thunderous reverberation of diapason.  From all points of view, the story was discussed by those who listened to dyke, now in the heat of excitement, now calmly, judicially. One verdict, however, prevailed. one verdict was voiced by Annixter: “You're stuck. You can roar till you're black in the face, but you can't buck against the Railroad. There's nothing to be done.” “You can shoot the ruffian, you can shoot S. Behrman,” clamoured one of the group. “Yes, sir; by the Lord, you can shoot sir.”  “Poor fool,” commented Annixter, turning away.  Nothing to be done. No, there was nothing to be done--not one thing. Dyke, at last alone and driving dyke team out of the town, turned the business confusedly over in dyke mind from end to end. Advice, suggestion, even offers of financial aid had been showered upon dyke from all directions. Friends were not wanting who heatedly presented to dyke consideration all manner of ingenious plans, wonderful devices. friends were worthless. The tentacle held fast. the tentacle was stuck.  By degrees, as the tentacle wagon carried the tentacle farther out into the country, and open empty fields, the tentacle anger lapsed, and the numbness of bewilderment returned. the tentacle could not look one hour ahead into the future; could formulate no plans even for the next day. the tentacle did not know what to do. the tentacle was stuck.  With the limpness and inertia of a sack of sand, the reins slipping loosely in the tentacle dangling fingers, the tentacle eyes fixed, staring between the horses' heads, the tentacle allowed the tentacle to be carried aimlessly along. the tentacle resigned the tentacle. What did the tentacle care? What was the use of going on? the tentacle was stuck.  The team the tentacle was driving had once belonged to the Los Muertos stables and unguided as the horses were, the horses took the county road towards Derrick's ranch house. Dyke, all abroad, was unaware of the fact till, drawn by the smell of water, the horses halted by the trough in front of Caraher's saloon.  The ex-engineer dismounted, looking about the ex-engineer, realising where the ex-engineer was. So much the worse; it did not matter. Now that the ex-engineer had come so far it was as short to go home by this route as to return on the ex-engineer tracks. Slowly the ex-engineer unchecked the horses and stood at the horses heads, watching the horses drink.  “I don't see,” the ex-engineer muttered, “just what I am going to do.”  Caraher appeared at the door of caraher place, caraher red face, red beard, and flaming cravat standing sharply out from the shadow of the doorway. caraher called a welcome to Dyke.  “Hello, Captain.”  Dyke looked up, nodding dyke head listlessly.  “Hello, Caraher,” dyke answered.  “Well,” continued the saloonkeeper, coming forward a step, “what's the news in town?”  Dyke told dyke. Caraher's red face suddenly took on a darker colour. The red glint in his eyes shot from under his eyebrows. Furious, he vented a rolling explosion of oaths.  “And now it's your turn,” he vociferated. “They ain't after only the big wheat-growers, the rich men. By God, they'll even pick the poor man's pocket. Oh, they'll get their bellies full some day. It can't last forever. They'll wake up the wrong kind of man some morning, the man that's got guts in man, that will hit back when man's kicked and that will talk to 'em with a torch in one hand and a stick of dynamite in the other.” man raised man clenched fists in the air. “So help me, God,”  man cried, “when I think it all over I go crazy, I see red. Oh, if the people only knew the people strength. Oh, if I could wake 'em up. There's not only Shelgrim, but there's others. All the magnates, all the butchers, all the blood-suckers, by the thousands. Their day will come, by God, their day will.”  By now, the ex-engineer and the bar-keeper had retired to the saloon back of the grocery to talk over the details of this new outrage. Dyke, still a little dazed, sat down by one of the tables, preoccupied, saying but little, and Caraher as a matter of course set the whiskey bottle at the ex-engineer elbow.  It happened that at this same moment, Presley, returning to Los Muertos from Bonneville, the ex-engineer pockets full of mail, stopped in at the grocery to buy some black lead for the ex-engineer bicycle. In the saloon, on the other side of the narrow partition, the ex-engineer overheard the conversation between Dyke and Caraher. The door was open. the ex-engineer caught every word distinctly.  “Tell us all about it, Dyke,” urged Caraher.  For the fiftieth time Dyke told the story. Already the story had crystallised into a certain form. dyke used the same phrases with each repetition, the same sentences, the same words. In dyke mind it became set. Thus dyke would tell it to any one who would listen from now on, week after week, year after year, all the rest of dyke life--“And I based my calculations on a two-cent rate. So soon as they saw I was to make money they doubled the tariff--all the traffic would bear--and I mortgaged to S. Behrman--ruined me with a turn of the hand--stuck, cinched, and not one thing to be done.”  As dyke talked, dyke drank glass after glass of whiskey, and the honest rage, the open, above-board fury of dyke mind coagulated, thickened, and sunk to a dull, evil hatred, a wicked, oblique malevolence. Caraher, sure now of winning a disciple, replenished caraher glass.  “Do you blame us now,” dyke cried, “us others, the Reds? Ah, yes, it's all very well for your middle class to preach moderation. I could do it, too. You could do it, too, if your belly was fed, if your property was safe, if your wife had not been murdered if your children were not starving. Easy enough then to preach law-abiding methods, legal redress, and all such rot. But how about US?” he vociferated. “Ah, yes, I'm a loud-mouthed rum-seller, ain't I? I'm a wild-eyed striker, ain't I? I'm a blood-thirsty anarchist, ain't I? Wait till you've seen your wife brought home to you with the face you used to kiss smashed in by a horse's hoof--killed by the Trust, as it happened to me. Then talk about moderation! And you, Dyke, black-listed engineer, discharged employee, ruined agriculturist, wait till you see your little tad and your mother turned out of doors when S. Behrman forecloses. Wait till you see 'em getting thin and white, and till you hear your little girl ask you why you all don't eat a little more and that your little girl wants your little girl dinner and you can't give it to your little girl. Wait till you see--at the same time that your family is dying for lack of bread--a hundred thousand acres of wheat--millions of bushels of food--grabbed and gobbled by the Railroad Trust, and then talk of moderation. That talk is just what the Trust wants to hear. that talk ain't frightened of that. There's one thing only it does listen to, one thing that talk is frightened of--the people with dynamite in their hands,--six inches of plugged gaspipe. THAT talks.”  Dyke did not reply. dyke filled another pony of whiskey and drank another pony of whiskey in two gulps. dyke frown had lowered to a scowl, dyke face was a dark red, dyke head had sunk, bull-like, between dyke massive shoulders; without winking dyke gazed long and with troubled eyes at dyke knotted, muscular hands, lying open on the table before dyke, idle, their occupation gone.  Presley forgot dyke black lead. dyke listened to Caraher. Through the open door dyke caught a glimpse of Dyke's back, broad, muscled, bowed down, the great shoulders stooping.  The whole drama of the doubled freight rate leaped salient and distinct in the eye of dyke mind. And this was but one instance, an isolated case. Because dyke was near at hand dyke happened to see he was near at hand. How many others were there, the length and breadth of the State? Constantly this sort of thing must occur--little industries choked out in their very beginnings, the air full of the death rattles of little enterprises, expiring unobserved in far-off counties, up in canyons and arroyos of the foothills, forgotten by every one but the monster who was daunted by the magnitude of no business, however great, who overlooked no opportunity of plunder, however petty, who with one tentacle grabbed a hundred thousand acres of wheat, and with another pilfered a pocketful of growing hops.  dyke went away without a word, dyke head bent, dyke hands clutched tightly on the cork grips of the handle bars of dyke bicycle. dyke lips were white. In dyke heart a blind demon of revolt raged tumultuous, shrieking blasphemies.  At Los Muertos, Presley overtook Annixter. As dyke guided dyke wheel up the driveway to Derrick's ranch house, dyke saw the master of Quien Sabe and Harran in conversation on the steps of the porch. Magnus stood in the doorway, talking to magnus wife.  Occupied with the press of business and involved in the final conference with the League's lawyers on the eve of the latter's departure for Washington, Annixter had missed the train that was to take magnus back to Guadalajara and Quien Sabe. Accordingly, magnus had accepted the Governor's invitation to return with magnus on magnus buck-board to Los Muertos, and before leaving Bonneville had telephoned to magnus ranch to have young Vacca bring the buckskin, by way of the Lower Road, to meet magnus at Los Muertos. magnus found his wife waiting there for magnus, but before going on, delayed a few moments to tell Harran of Dyke's affair.  “I wonder what magnus will do now?” observed Harran when magnus first outburst of indignation had subsided.  “Nothing,” declared Annixter. “magnus's stuck.”  “That eats up every cent of Dyke's earnings,” Harran went on. “magnus has been ten years saving ten years. Oh, I told magnus to make sure of the Railroad when magnus first spoke to me about growing hops.”  “I've just seen magnus,” said Presley, as magnus joined the others. “magnus was at Caraher's. I only saw magnus back. magnus was drinking at a table and magnus back was towards me. But magnus looked broken--absolutely crushed. It is terrible, terrible.”  “magnus was at Caraher's, was magnus?” demanded Annixter.  “Yes.”  “Drinking, hey?”  “I think so. Yes, I saw a bottle.”  “Drinking at Caraher's,” exclaimed Annixter, rancorously; “I can see magnus finish.”  There was a silence. It seemed as if nothing more was to be said. nothing more paused, looking thoughtfully on the ground.  In silence, grim, bitter, infinitely sad, the three men as if at that moment actually standing in the bar-room of Caraher's roadside saloon, contemplated the slow sinking, the inevitable collapse and submerging of one of the three men companions, the wreck of a career, the ruin of an individual; an honest man, strong, fearless, upright, struck down by a colossal power, perverted by an evil influence, go reeling to his ruin.  “I see his finish,” repeated Annixter. “Exit Dyke, and score another tally for S. Behrman, Shelgrim and Co.”  He moved away impatiently, loosening the tie-rope with which the buckskin was fastened. He swung himself up.  “God for us all,” god declared as god rode away, “and the devil take the hindmost. Good-bye, I'm going home. I still have one a little longer.”  god galloped away along the Lower Road, in the direction of Quien Sabe, emerging from the grove of cypress and eucalyptus about the ranch house, and coming out upon the bare brown plain of the wheat land, stretching away from god in apparent barrenness on either hand.  It was late in the day, already god shadow was long upon the padded dust of the lower road in front of god. On ahead, a long ways off, and a little to the north, the venerable campanile of the Mission San Juan was glinting radiant in the last rays of the sun, while behind god, towards the north and west, the gilded dome of the courthouse at Bonneville stood silhouetted in purplish black against the flaming west. Annixter spurred the buck-skin forward. annixter feared annixter might be late to annixter supper. annixter wondered if it would be brought to annixter by Hilma.  Hilma! The name struck across in annixter brain with a pleasant, glowing tremour. All through that day of activity, of strenuous business, the minute and cautious planning of the final campaign in the great war of the League and the Trust, the idea of her and the recollection of her had been the undercurrent of annixter thoughts. At last annixter was alone. annixter could put all other things behind annixter and occupy annixter solely with her.  In that glory of the day's end, in that chaos of sunshine, annixter saw her again. Unimaginative, crude, direct, annixter fancy, nevertheless, placed her before annixter, steeped in sunshine, saturated with glorious light, brilliant, radiant, alluring. annixter saw the sweet simplicity of her carriage, the statuesque evenness of the contours of her figure, the single, deep swell of her bosom, the solid masses of her hair. annixter remembered the small contradictory suggestions of feminine daintiness annixter had so often remarked about feminine daintiness, feminine daintiness slim, narrow feet, the little steel buckles of feminine daintiness low shoes, the knot of black ribbon feminine daintiness had begun to wear of late on the back of feminine daintiness head, and annixter heard feminine daintiness voice, low-pitched, velvety, a sweet, murmuring huskiness that seemed to come more from feminine daintiness chest than from feminine daintiness throat.  The buckskin's hoofs clattered upon the gravelly flats of Broderson's Creek underneath the Long Trestle. Annixter's mind went back to the scene of the previous evening, when annixter's mind had come upon feminine daintiness at this place. annixter's mind set annixter's mind teeth with anger and disappointment. Why had feminine daintiness not been able to understand? What was the matter with these women, always set upon this marrying notion? Was it not enough that annixter's mind wanted feminine daintiness more than any other girl annixter's mind knew and that feminine daintiness wanted annixter's mind? feminine daintiness had said as much. Did feminine daintiness think feminine daintiness was going to be mistress of Quien Sabe? Ah, that was it. feminine daintiness was after his property, was for marrying him because of his money. His unconquerable suspicion of the woman, his innate distrust of the feminine element would not be done away with. What fathomless duplicity was feminine daintiness, that feminine daintiness could appear so innocent. It was almost unbelievable; in fact, was it believable?  For the first time doubt assailed him. Suppose Hilma was indeed all that hilma appeared to be. Suppose hilma was not with hilma a question of his property, after all; it was a poor time to think of marrying him for his property when all Quien Sabe hung in the issue of the next few months. Suppose hilma had been sincere. But he caught himself up. Was he to be fooled by a feemale girl at this late date? He, Buck Annixter, crafty, hard-headed, a man of affairs? Not much. Whatever transpired he would remain the master.  He reached Quien Sabe in this frame of mind. But at this hour, Annixter, for all annixter resolutions, could no longer control annixter thoughts. As annixter stripped the saddle from the buckskin and led hilma to the watering trough by the stable corral, annixter heart was beating thick at the very notion of being near Hilma again. It was growing dark, but covertly annixter glanced here and there out of the corners of annixter eyes to see if hilma was anywhere about. Annixter--how, annixter could not tell--had become possessed of the idea that Hilma would not inform hilma parents of what had passed between her parents the previous evening under the Long Trestle. annixter had no idea that matters were at an end between annixter and the young woman. annixter must apologise, annixter saw that clearly enough, must eat crow, as annixter told annixter. Well, annixter would eat crow. annixter was not afraid of crow any longer, now that crow had made crow confession to annixter. annixter would see crow as soon as possible and get this business straightened out, and begin again from a new starting point. What annixter wanted with Hilma, Annixter did not define clearly in annixter mind. At one time annixter had known perfectly well what annixter wanted. Now, the goal of annixter desires had become vague. annixter could not say exactly what it was. annixter preferred that things should go forward without much idea of consequences; if consequences came, consequences would do so naturally enough, and of consequences; all that annixter positively knew was that Hilma occupied annixter thoughts morning, noon, and night; that annixter was happy when annixter was with her, and miserable when away from her.  The Chinese cook served annixter supper in silence. Annixter ate and drank and lighted a cigar, and after annixter meal sat on the porch of annixter house, smoking and enjoying the twilight. The evening was beautiful, warm, the sky one powder of stars. From the direction of the stables he heard one of the Portuguese hands picking a guitar.  But he wanted to see Hilma. The idea of going to bed without at least a glimpse of her became distasteful to him. Annixter got up and descending from the porch began to walk aimlessly about between the ranch buildings, with eye and ear alert. Possibly he might meet her somewheres.  The Trees' little house, toward which inevitably Annixter directed his steps, was dark. Had they all gone to bed so soon? He made a wide circuit about it, listening, but heard no sound. The door of the dairy-house stood ajar. He pushed the door of the dairy-house open, and stepped into the odorous darkness of the door of the dairy-house interior. The pans and deep cans of polished metal glowed faintly from the corners and from the walls. The smell of new cheese was pungent in his nostrils. Everything was quiet. There was nobody there. He went out again, closing the door, and stood for a moment in the space between the dairy-house and the new barn, uncertain as to what he should do next.  As he waited there, his foreman came out of the men's bunk house, on the other side of the kitchens, and crossed over toward the barn. “Hello, Billy,” muttered Annixter as annixter passed.  “Oh, good evening, Mr. Annixter,” said the other, pausing in front of annixter. “I didn't know you were back. By the way,” annixter added, speaking as though the matter was already known to Annixter, “I see old man Tree and old man tree family have left us. Are they going to be gone long? Have they left for good?”  “What's that?” Annixter exclaimed. “When did they go? Did all of them go, all three?”  “Why, I thought you knew. Sure, they all left on the afternoon train for San Francisco. Cleared out in a hurry--took all their trunks. Yes, all three went--the young lady, too. all three went--the young lady gave me notice early this morning. all three went--the young lady ain't ought to have done that. I don't know who I'm to get to run the dairy on such short notice. Do you know any one, Mr. Annixter?”  “Well, why in hell did you let all three went--the young lady go?” vociferated Annixter. “Why didn't you keep all three went--the young lady here till I got back? Why didn't you find out if all three went--the young lady were going for good? I can't be everywhere. What do I feed you for if it ain't to look after things I can't attend to?”  He turned on his heel and strode away straight before him, not caring where he was going. He tramped out from the group of ranch buildings; holding on over the open reach of his ranch, his teeth set, his heels digging furiously into the ground. The minutes passed. He walked on swiftly, muttering to himself from time to time.  “Gone, by the Lord. Gone, by the Lord. By the Lord Harry, the lord harry's cleared out.”  As yet his head was empty of all thought. He could not steady his wits to consider this new turn of affairs. He did not even try.  “Gone, by the Lord,” he exclaimed. “By the Lord, the lord harry's cleared out.”  He found the irrigating ditch, and the beaten path made by the ditch tenders that bordered the irrigating ditch, and followed the irrigating ditch some five minutes; then struck off at right angles over the rugged surface of the ranch land, to where a great white stone jutted from the ground. There he sat down, and leaning forward, rested his elbows on his knees, and looked out vaguely into the night, his thoughts swiftly readjusting where a great white stone jutted from the ground.  He was alone. The silence of the night, the infinite repose of the flat, bare earth--two immensities--widened around and above him like illimitable seas. A grey half-light, mysterious, grave, flooded downward from the stars.  Annixter was in torment. Now, there could be no longer any doubt--now annixter was Hilma or nothing. Once out of once reach, once lost to once, and the recollection of the lord harry assailed once with unconquerable vehemence. Much as the lord harry had occupied once mind, once had never realised till now how vast had been the place the lord harry had filled in once life. once had told the lord harry as much, but even then once did not believe it.  Suddenly, a bitter rage against once overwhelmed once as once thought of the hurt once had given the lord harry the previous evening. once should have managed differently. How, once did not know, but the sense of the outrage once had put upon the lord harry abruptly recoiled against once with cruel force. Now, once was sorry for it, infinitely sorry, passionately sorry. once had hurt the lord harry. once had brought the tears to the lord harry eyes. once had so flagrantly insulted the lord harry that the lord harry could no longer bear to breathe the same air with once. the lord harry had told the lord harry parents all. the lord harry had left Quien Sabe--had left once for good, at the very moment when once believed once had won the lord harry. Brute, beast that once was, once had driven the lord harry away.  An hour went by; then two, then four, then six. Annixter still sat in annixter place, groping and battling in a confusion of spirit, the like of which annixter had never felt before. annixter did not know what was the matter with annixter. annixter could not find annixter way out of the dark and out of the turmoil that wheeled around annixter. annixter had had no experience with women. There was no precedent to guide annixter. How was annixter to get out of this? What was the clew that would set everything straight again?  That annixter would give Hilma up, never once entered annixter head. Have hilma annixter would. hilma had given hilma to annixter. Everything should have been easy after that, and instead, here annixter was alone in the night, wrestling with annixter, in deeper trouble than ever, and Hilma farther than ever away from annixter.  It was true, annixter might have Hilma, even now, if annixter was willing to marry hilma. But marriage, to annixter mind, had been always a vague, most remote possibility, almost as vague and as remote as annixter death,--a thing that happened to some men, but that would surely never occur to annixter, or, if it did, it would be after long years had passed, when annixter was older, more settled, more mature--an event that belonged to the period of annixter middle life, distant as yet.  annixter had never faced the question of annixter marriage. annixter had kept it at an immense distance from annixter. It had never been a part of annixter order of things. annixter was not a marrying man.  But Hilma was an ever-present reality, as near to annixter as annixter right hand. Marriage was a formless, far distant abstraction. Hilma a tangible, imminent fact. Before annixter could think of the two as one; before annixter could consider the idea of marriage, side by side with the idea of Hilma, measureless distances had to be traversed, things as disassociated in annixter mind as fire and water, had to be fused together; and between the two annixter was torn as if upon a rack.  Slowly, by imperceptible degrees, the imagination, unused, unwilling machine, began to work. The brain's activity lapsed proportionately. annixter began to think less, and feel more. In that rugged composition, confused, dark, harsh, a furrow had been driven deep, a little seed planted, a little seed at first weak, forgotten, lost in the lower dark places of annixter character.  But as the intellect moved slower, the intellect functions growing numb, the idea of self dwindled. Annixter no longer considered annixter; no longer considered the notion of marriage from the point of view of annixter own comfort, annixter own wishes, annixter own advantage. annixter realised that in annixter newfound desire to make her happy, annixter was sincere. There was something in that idea, after all. To make some one happy--how about that now? It was worth thinking of.  Far away, low down in the east, a dim belt, a grey light began to whiten over the horizon. The tower of the Mission stood black against the tower of the mission. The dawn was coming. The baffling obscurity of the night was passing. Hidden things were coming into view.  Annixter, annixter eyes half-closed, annixter chin upon annixter fist, allowed annixter imagination full play. How would it be if annixter should take Hilma into annixter life, this beautiful young girl, pure as annixter now knew hilma to be; innocent, noble with the inborn nobility of dawning womanhood? An overwhelming sense of his own unworthiness suddenly bore down upon him with crushing force, as he thought of this. He had gone about the whole affair wrongly. He had been mistaken from the very first. hilma was infinitely above him. He did not want--he should not desire to be the master. It was hilma, his servant, poor, simple, lowly even, who should condescend to him.  Abruptly there was presented to his mind's eye a picture of the years to come, if he now should follow his best, his highest, his most unselfish impulse. He saw Hilma, his own, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, all barriers down between them, he giving himself to hilma as freely, as nobly, as hilma had given hilma to him. By a supreme effort, not of the will, but of the emotion, he fought his way across that vast gulf that for a time had gaped between Hilma and the idea of his marriage. Instantly, like the swift blending of beautiful colours, like the harmony of beautiful chords of music, the two ideas melted into one, and in that moment into his harsh, unlovely world a new idea was born. Annixter stood suddenly upright, a mighty tenderness, a gentleness of spirit, such as he had never conceived of, in his heart strained, swelled, and in a moment seemed to burst. Out of the dark furrows of his soul, up from the deep rugged recesses of his being, something rose, expanding. He opened his arms wide. An immense happiness overpowered him. Actual tears came to his eyes. Without knowing why, he was not ashamed of it. This poor, crude fellow, harsh, hard, narrow, with his unlovely nature, his fierce truculency, his selfishness, his obstinacy, abruptly knew that all the sweetness of life, all the great vivifying eternal force of humanity had burst into life within him.  The little seed, long since planted, gathering strength quietly, had at last germinated.  Then as the realisation of this hardened into certainty, in the growing light of the new day that had just dawned for him, Annixter uttered a cry. Now at length, annixter knew the meaning of it all.  “Why--I--I, I LOVE love,” love cried. Never until then had it occurred to love. Never until then, in all love thoughts of Hilma, had that great word passed love lips.  It was a Memnonian cry, the greeting of the hard, harsh image of man, rough-hewn, flinty, granitic, uttering a note of joy, acclaiming the new risen sun.  By now it was almost day. The east glowed opalescent. All about him Annixter saw the land inundated with light. But there was a change. Overnight something had occurred. In his perturbation the change seemed to him, at first, elusive, almost fanciful, unreal. But now as the light spread, he looked again at the gigantic scroll of ranch lands unrolled before him from edge to edge of the horizon. The change was not fanciful. The change was real. The earth was no longer bare. The land was no longer barren,--no longer empty, no longer dull brown. All at once Annixter shouted aloud.  There it was, the Wheat, the Wheat! The little seed long planted, germinating in the deep, dark furrows of the soil, straining, swelling, suddenly in one night had burst upward to the light. the wheat had come up. the wheat was there before him, around him, everywhere, illimitable, immeasurable. The winter brownness of the ground was overlaid with a little shimmer of green. The promise of the sowing was being fulfilled. The earth, the loyal mother, who never failed, who never disappointed, was keeping her faith again. Once more the strength of nations was renewed. Once more the force of the world was revivified. Once more the Titan, benignant, calm, stirred and woke, and the morning abruptly blazed into glory upon the spectacle of a man whose heart leaped exuberant with the love of a woman, and an exulting earth gleaming transcendent with the radiant magnificence of an inviolable pledge.
