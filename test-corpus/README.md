This directory contains two corpora:

1. Suspected Algo

Several texts that we strongly suspect were written by using combinatorial aids such as
*Plotto* and *Plot Genie*. In many cases, these novelettes were written by William Wallace Cook
himself, and bear the obvious mark of formulaic plot development. We will use these texts to
determine the threshold in text reuse metrics.

The Suspected Algo corpus includes:

- Cook, William Wallace. *Adrift in the Unknown, or, Queer Adventures in a Queer Realm*. New
  York, NY: Street & Smith, 1904.
- Cook. *Cast Away At The Pole*. The Adventure Library 144. New York, NY: Street & Smith, 1904.
- Cook. “Castaways of the Year 2000.” *The Argosy*, December 1912.
- Cook. “Gold Grabbers.” *The Argosy*, June 1914.  
- Cook. “Skates, Skis and a Saphead.” *Wide-Awake Magazine*, January 10, 1916.
- Cook. “Dollars Romantic.” *Top Notch Magazine*, February 1, 1922.
- Olsen, James P. “Six-Gun Gamble.” Speed Western Stories, December 1945.

2. Suspected No-algo

Containing several modernist classics that were unlikely to result to formulaic methods of
composition.
