Dollars Romantic
William Wallace Cook
(A COMPLETE NOVEL) 

CHAPTER I. 

Along the Black Canon Trail 
Wesley J. Whipple rode sing- 
ing; and when he turned into 
Grand Avenue he scattered 
his husky ballads the full 
length of it, and on past the Five Points 
to Doolittle's corral in First Avenue. 
He was always happy; but he was al- 
ways twice as happy when he had money 
to spend as he was when “broke" and 
with difficult times in prospect. Now 
he had thirty dollars in his pocket, the 
old reliable rabbit’s foot on his watch 
chain, and a note from Uncle Wes un- 
der the sweatband of his Stetson. 

The note was responsible for Whip- 
ple’s arrival in Phoenix that bright, 

sunny afternoon, when all the birds were 
warbling in the tops of the cottonwoods 
along the town ditch, and chaffering 
melodiously among the umbrella trees 
and oleanders of the courthouse plaza. 
For it was springtime and nesting time, 
and there is a difference even in sunny 
southern Arizona at such a season. 

Blind Fate, always conjuring with a 
mortal's affairs, had made of that sum- 
mons from Uncle Wes merely an ex- 
cuse for Whipple to spend two days on 
a trail that had a big town at the end 
of it/ After the monotony of three 
months spent in “dressing down" plates 
and “hanging up" stamps in the Three- 
ply gold mill, the prospect of picture 
shows enjoyed with Katie or Mamie or 
Lorena was not without its thrills. And 
there was all of thirty pesos with which 

to finance a period of pleasure in the 
city. 

True, Uncle Wes had said in his let- 
ter: ‘‘Pm sick; and this time it’s so 
blamed serious I feel like I wanted my 
only relative handy.” But then, Uncle 
Wes was of the complaining kind and 
enjoyed his ailments. Six times in three 
years he had called his nephew to town 
in the fear that he was already cross- 
ing the Great Divide; but the shadow 
had passed, and the Great Divide had 
receded from Uncle Wesley's sky line. 
And during these supposed crises Whip- 
ple had acted as nurse, without pay, 
thereby saving the canny Uncle Wes 
many dollars which otherwise would 
have gone to some stranger. Uncle 
Wesley Plunkett McDougal was a tight- 
wad and knew how to hang on to his 
money. 

Uncle Wes had never lost any sleep 
worrying about his nephew, so the 
nephew could hardly be blamed if he 
had no hard and fast apprehensions re- 
garding Uncle Wes. Nevertheless, 
Whipple had a warm and sympathetic 
heart. If he had really thought his un- 
cle was critically ill, he would not have 
come singing into town that afternoon, 
and he would not have planned his pro- 
gram of innocent pleasures with such 
joyous abandon. But when an imagi- 
native relative has cried “Wolf !” half 
a dozen times and no wolf has material- 
ized, what logical reason is there for 
thinking that a seventh summons should 
be taken in any other way than cum 
grano sjalis — “with a grain of salt,” as 
the saying is? 

So, in a pleasant frame of mind, 
Whipple rode into Doolittle's corral. 
The bay horse, Baldy, which he had 
borrowed from the superintendent at 
the Three-Ply Mine, he turned over 
to Doolittle in person. The proprietor 
of the corral did not greet Whipple ef- 
fusively; in fact, he wore a sour ex- 
pression and stood watching with 
knitted brows while the newcomer un- 
hitched a dusty suit case from the sad- 
dle cantle. 

“What's the matter, Lafe?” inquired 
Whipple, turning about, satchel in hand, 
to give the corral man a steady look. 


“What means that fishy eye and for- 
bidding manner?” 

“You owe me six dollars, W. J.,” re-, 
turned Doolittle frankly, “and some of 
it has been runnin’ for two years. This 
ain't no free corral, and I can't keep 
things goin' without the dinero. You 
got to pay up what y'u owe or take your 
hoss some other place. Sorry a heap 
I got to talk like this, but business is 
business, and I ain't here for my health.” 

“Well, well !” Whipple pulled out his 
thirty dollars and subtracted six from 
the roll. “What's a little matter like 
that between friends? There's your 
money, Lafe.” 

Lafe Doolittle thawed immediately. 
“I wasn't worried a mite, W. J.,” he 
averred brightly, “but you know how it 
is. Plunk McDougal is down ag'in ?” 

“He writes me lie is.” 

“The old curmudgeon is full o’ funny 
nations that a way. Reg’lar false 
alarm. He's too pesky ornery to kick 
the bucket and leave his boodle to you, 
or any one else. That's the one thing 
that keeps him on the turf — can’t bear 
to give up what he's got.” 

“He's my uncle, Doolittle, and that 
sort of talk doesn’t set well.” 

“I don't care how it sets, W. J. The 
truth never hurt nobody yet. This hull 
town knows that when Plunk McDougal 
goes up the spout he'll take the spout 
right with him. Darn little you'll git. 
Bank on Plunk to fix it somehow.” ^ 

A feeling of loyalty to his only liv- 
ing relative brought a hot rebuke to 
Whipple's lips; but he smothered the 
sharp words, realizing in his heart that 
there was considerable truth in Doo- 
little's remarks. Leaving the corral with 
his suit case, Whipple made his way 
to the Hotel Fordham. 

Felix Vannell, the day clerk, did not 
display much enthusiasm as he watched 
Whipple approach the counter and pick 
up a pen. “Buenos, Felix,” said Whip- 
ple, in his friendliest manner. 

“Howdy,” 

In that little word “howdy,” passed 
from friend to friend, can be wrapped 
up all the pleasant reminiscences of the 
past, a lot of present good cheer, and a 
cordial wish for future joys. But all

Felix, the day clerk, wrapped up in it 
was a perfunctory recognition right off 
the ice. 

Whipple hung the inked pen over the 
register and stared hard at his quondam 
amigo. “What’s wrong ?” he inquired. 
“Is it possible I'm not welcome here, 
Mr. Vannell? Are you trying to chase 
me over to The Plaza ?” 

“I got orders to chase eight dollars 
out o’ your clothes, W. J., before ever 
allowin’ you to register here again.” It 
seemed to hurt Vannell to voice this 
ultimatum. “We’ve had you on the slate 
for those eight plunks ever since last 
fall. I’m sorry; but you know Pm only 
a hired man and don’t own the place.” 

“Why, shucks!” exclaimed Whipple. 
“Everybody knows I pay my honest 
debts. This is the first time I’ve been 
in town since last fall.” He took out 
his twenty-four dollars and passed over 
eight of them to the clerk. “Now are 
we all right?” 

The eight dollars worked their in- 
stant magic. All the frost vanished 
from the clerk’s face and manner. 
Heartily he gripped the hand holding 
the pen, placed the register more con- 
veniently, and sounded the alarm for 
Wing Loo the Chinaman bell hop. 

“I’m sure glad to see you, W. J.,” 
babbled Vannell. “Uncle off his feed 
once more, eh? Well, here’s hoping.” 

“Hoping what?” queried Whipple, 
after carefully writing his name in the 
book. 

“Why, that when Plunk McDougal 
does make up his mind to kick off he 
leaves you all his dough; but every- 
body says he won’t, or any part of it. 
Still, we’re all hoping.” 

“It’s my uncle, my mother’s only 
brother, you're talking about, Vannell,” 
Whipple returned, “so you might use 
the soft pedal with me. I don’t want 
his money.” 

“You could use it, couldn’t you?” 
Here was the old siren's song against 
which Whipple had stopped his ears 
ever since he had been old enough to 
realize what money meant in this world. 

“Use it?” he echoed. “Say ” He 

stopped short, however, and did not fin- 
ish. The enthusiasm that had rushed 


into his sun-browned face vanished as 
suddenly as it had appeared. “No 
chance,” he added. “Anyhow, I couldn’t 
be happy if I didn’t stand on my own 
feet. Same old room?” 

“Sure !” VanYiell handed a key to the 
Chinaman. “Fifteen, Loo.” 

“Fifteen,” echoed the careful Loo; 
“awri*.” 

A little later, in room 15, Whipple 
shaved himself, took a hot bath, and 
got into his best clothes, which he had 
brought along with him in the suit case. 
All the gold mills in Arizona could not 
have turned out a finer-looking amalga- 
mator than Wesley J. Whipple as he 
stood, clad in his best, onceymore in 
the Fordham lobby. He stepped into 
a telephone booth and rang up the home 
of Mr. Galusha Mingo. The head of 
the house answered, and his warm voice 
chilled when he discovered who was at 
the Fordham end of the wire. 

“How’s Katie, Mr. Mingo?” queried 
Whipple, just a little unnerved by an in- 
tangible feeling that something more 
was wrong. 

“She’s well as usual, W. J.,” said 
Mingo, still distantly. He was only six 
blocks away, but one might have im- 
agined that he was six miles. 

“Uncle Wes is under the weather 
again,” Whipple went on, “and I’m in 
town for a spell. But this evening is 
mine, and I’d like to make a date with 
Katie to ” 

“You will make no more dates with 
Katie, young man,” and the receiver 
fairly snapped. “I thought you had 
prospects, but I’ve come to the conclu- 
sion you haven’t. You are always in 
debt ; you’ll never get ahead. Out 
at the Three-ply Mine you pull down 
thirty a week, but you never save a 
cent of it, and you owe everybody in 
town. Katie can’t afford to waste her 
time. Good-by.” Bang ! And Mr. 
Galusha Mingo “hung up.” 

Whipple was staggered, but only for 
a moment. His acquaintance among the 
gentler sex was not limited to Katie 
Mingo, although his dreams were more 
about Katie than any other. He called 
the boarding house of Miss Serena Has- 
kins and asked for Miss Lorena Marlin,

only to learn that Miss Marlin was out 
of town. Then he had central give him 
Mr. Anson Philbrick’s residence. As 
luck would have it, Miss Mamie Phil- 
brick answered the phone herself ; and, 
although her voice was courteous in the 
extreme, there was totally lacking any 
quality of pleasure. Miss Philbrick was 
sorry, but she had an engagement for 
the evening. 

“Compliments of J. Hardluck,” mut- 
tered Whipple as he replaced the re- 
ceiver on the hooks and left the booth. 

A man was waiting for him — one 
Hathaway, a custom tailor. He ap- 
proached Whipple in the cautious man- 
ner of a hunter stalking an antelope. 

“Hello, Hathaway !” called Whipple. 

Hathaway nodded. He was measur- 
ing the amalgamator with his eyes, tak- 
ing in every detail of the nobby suit 
which had been built in his establish- 
ment and for which, as yet, he had re- 
ceived only a fifty-per-cent payment on 
account. 

“There’s a balance of thirty dollars 
on your bill, W. J.,” Hathaway said, 
“and you told me you would settle next 
time you were in town.” 

“Well, here I am,” Whipple answered. 
“This is the first time I’ve been in 
town since I got these clothes. I’ll be 
here probably for two or three days — 
maybe longer. Before I leave, Hath- 
away, m ” 

But no, that would not do for Hath- 
away. He believed a bird in the hand 
worth a whole flock in the bush. Whip- 
ple was a fine chap, but his money had 
a way of getting away from him. He 
would like a little something on account. 
How about fifteen dollars, just half of 
what Whipple owed him? Expenses 
were heavy and collections hard. Hath- 
away would be very grateful to Whipple 
if he could pay something. Whipple 
was touched with remorse and gave 
Hathaway all he had left — sixteen dol- 
lars. Then Hathaway, cheered and 
grateful, shook hands with Whipple and 
asked him to drop around and look at 
some new suitings which had just ar- 
rived. After this he blithely left the 
hotel. 

“Strapped !” murmured Whipple, 


sinking into a chair. “ ‘All dressed up 
and no place to go/ But I’ve got to 
go some place, or there’ll be more credi- 
tors here, and I’ll have to stand ’em 
off; and I certainly hate to sidestep a 
man to whom I owe an honest debt. By 
George,” he told himself, jumping up, 
“I’ll go and see Uncle Wes. He’s not 
expecting me till late this evening, but 
I’ll give him a surprise. I’ll be safe 
with Uncle Wes. Nobody with a bill 
ever calls on him.” 

He left the hotel humming a song. 
His mood was not so exalted as it had 
been while he was riding into town, but 
he was still happy in a subdued, irre- 
sponsible sort of way. If he had to 
have more money, Uncle Wes might 
lend him some and take his watch for 
security. 

CHAPTER II. 

CATCHING HIS BREATH. 

P OR ten years — ever since he had sold 
* the Letty Lee Mine for three hun- 
dred and five thousand dollars — Wesley 
Plunkett McDougal had tried with con- 
siderable success to convince himself 
that he was a confirmed invalid. He 
was sixty years old, and stood six feet 
three in his stockings, running mostly 
to length and very little to breadth. 
Some said he was “narrow,” others said 
he was “near,” but the majority said he 
was “close.” All these colloquial 
phrases hit the one mark — “tightfisted.” 
His acquaintances referred to him 
among themselves as “Old Plunks.” 
This sobriquet, harking back to the col- 
loquial once more, was derived from 
the word “plunk,” meaning dollar, and 
also from McDougal’s middle name, 
Plunkett. 

For ten years the old man had lived 
in Josh Hopper’s boarding house on 
Fourth Avenue, beating Hopper down 
in his rates a little with each succeed- 
ing year on the score of being a steady 
boarder. So well did McDougal man- 
age that his living had not cost him 
two hundred and fifty dollars a year; 
nor had his “amusements” cost him any 
more. His only amusement consisted in 
patronizing quack doctors and in buy- 
ing advertised tonics and nostrums.

Whenever he emptied a bottle he treas- 
ured it, finally selling the bottles in 
dozen lots at five cents a lot. This bot- 
tle money kept him in smoking tobacco. 

Among McDougal’s many queer 
ideas was his hatred of paying taxes. 
He would have had a small house of 
his own, but that would have meant 
dealing with the assessor. He had 
chances galore to invest his money safely 
at a good rate of interest, but the in- 
come tax would have caught him. His 
funds were on deposit, subject to check, 
but just where they were, or how much 
they totaled, no supervisor had ever 
been able to discover. The tax-exempt 
feature of municipal bonds had ap- 
pealed to him once, but he had with- 
stood the temptation to buy such bonds ; 
for he feared that the government 
would pass a law putting a tax upon 
them as soon as it was known that he 
had loaded up with the securities. 

It was five o'clock in the afternoon 
when Whipple made his call upon his 
uncle. The old man was reclining in a 
lazy-back, canvas chair on Hopper's sec- 
ond-story porch. On a table at his el- 
bow were various panaceas in bottles, 
an empty glass, and a pitcher of water. 
The invalid was smoking a corncob pipe 
and looking very pale and feeble. He 
was too long for the chair, and his feet, 
in old carpet slippers, stuck out into 
space from beneath the Navajo blanket 
that sought to cover him. 

“Well, W. J.," said Uncle Wes, ex- 
tending his hand with a painful effort, 
“I reckon this is the last time I'll ever 
call you in from the Three-ply. Pull 
a chair up close. I’ve got to talk to 
you for a spell, and my voice is so weak 
it won't carry far." 

“Oh, I guess you're not so bad off, 
Uncle Wes," returned Whipple cheer- 
ily, placing a chair within confidential 
distance and seating himself. “What 
seems to be the matter now?" 

“Everything," answered Uncle Wes 
gloomily; “but the last thing to put a 
crimp into me is my heart. Doc Flick- 
inger says I’ll last three months. He's 
been right on the job, watching me 
every minute. Why, I've paid him 
eleven dollars in the last two weeks! 


Three months, W. J. ! After that, I’ll 
stop being an expense to myself, and 
everybody else. First I want to tell you 
I've bought a place for myself out to 
the cem'tery. It’s on Ham Biffle’s plot, 
and I got just room enough for one for 
five dollars. Ham was needing money, 
so I picked it up at a bargain." 

Being young, and more or less in love 
with life, these particulars gave Whip- 
ple a gruesome feeling. “I wouldn't 
talk about it, Uncle Weo," he admon- 
ished. ) 

“Got to," insisted the other. “I’ve 
reached a p'int where you’ve got to be 
in the know about every blamed thing, 
W. J. I want everything plain and 
simple; no fuss, feathers or trimmings. 
Understand? Prices are scandalous for 
things like that, and I want you to keep 
down the cost. Promise !" 

Whipple promised hastily, eager for 
his uncle to shift the subject. Mc- 
Dougal, having received the promise, 
drew a long breath of satisfaction, then 
refilled his pipe and lighted it. 

“Your heart would be all right," 
averred Whipple, “if you stopped smok- 
ing so much, and if you cut out all that 
patent dope." 

Uncle Wes frowned. “You've got 
the darnedest notions," he grunted. 
“Tobacco, and the stuff in them bottles, 
is all that’s keeping me alive. I'll be 
around for three months; Doc Flick- 
inger promises me three months." 

“Maybe Doc Flickinger is wrong," 
Whipple suggested. “Why don't you 
get a specialist from out of town?" 

“And throw away good money, huh ?" 
came scathingly from Uncle Wes. “I 
wrote Doc Mixinger, of Prescott, and 
asked what he'd charge to come down 
for a consultation. And what do you 
think he 'wrote back? Five hundred 
dollars! Robber! I offered him fifty, 
and he sent back a postal card sayin' 
'Die in peace.' And, by gorry, that’s 
what I'm going to do. I won't be 
trimmed in my last days; never have 
been trimmed, and I won't let any spe- 
cialist begin It now. Three months, 
W. J. ! That’ll bring it July fifteenth. 
I'll miss the real hot weather, anyway." 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


Flickinger seems to have it figured 
out pretty fine,” Whipple commented. 

“He figgered it out for Dan Jipley 
jest like that, W. J. He gave Dan nine- 
teen days and a half, and Dan kept 
the appointment on the dot. Same with 
Steve Suffern. Doc gave him five 
months, and Steve didn’t disapp’int him. 
So I know I’ve got to hike on July 
fifteenth. But that don’t worry me. 
1 11 be cuttin’ off a bill of expense, and 
I’ve always found that cheerin’. Hop- 
per will take it hard, I expect. I’ve 
h e cn a pretty steady boarder here. 

“You know how it was with me, W. 
J. All the time I was prospectin’ in the 
hills I had to live on cottonwood bark 
and niggerhead cactus, mostly. They 
was tough times. I had to skimp and 
save, and I sorto got into the habit; 
then, when I struck the Letty Lee, and 
sold out for a fortune, I didn’t know 
how to spend what I had. And that’s 
kind of worried me. But the publicans ! 
By gorry,” and here Uncle Wes 
chuckled, “I’ve kept away from the pub- 
licans. No tax collector ever got me, 
and no tax collector is ever goin’ to. 

“W. J., I’ve got three hundred thou- 
sand dollars. It’s all in the banks, and 
not in the savings departments, either. 
You re my only heir. If I pass out and 
leave the three hundred thousand to 
you by will, there’ll be an inheritance 
tax to be paid. But if I give you the 
money outright, as a free gift, there 
won’t be no tax — inheritance, income, 
or otherwise.” 

Whipple caught his breath. “You — 
you wouldn’t do that, Uncle Wes!” he 
exclaimed. 

“I’m figgerin’ on it. It’s the only way 
to beat the tax collectors, W. J. I'd 
strain myself a lot to do that. But I 
don’t allow to give it to you all in a 
bunch. I’m aimin’ to scatter it over 
three months, making the last and final 
donation on the evenin’ of Tulv four- 
teenth.” J 

This was overwhelming. Uncle Wes 
had never given Whipple so much as 
a plugged nickel before. And now he 
was going to present him with three 
hundred thousand dollars. 

“I call that mighty generous of you, 


Uncle Wes,” said the nephew, with feel- 
ing. “Only uncle I ever had ! And I’ve 
always thought a lot of you. I won’t 
squander the money; I’ll— I’ll invest it 
and make it grow !” 

“No; you don’t!” Uncle Wes barked 
at him fiercely. “If you invest it, and 
it grows, you’ll be payin’ taxes. I won’t 
have that ! I won’t have a cent of my 
money invested and growin’ into taxes. 
Get that straight, W. J. That’s one 
reason .I’m going to hand the dinero 
to you in installments. I want to watch 
you squander it, and have the good time 
with it that I ought to have had and 
didn t know how. You needn’t squan- 
der the last installment, because I won’t 
be here to watch. The final donation 
I want you to put in a bank in a check- 
ing account, and jest draw on it for 
livin’ expenses. Get the idea? Here, 
look at this.” 

He drew an old wallet from his pocket 
and removed an oblong slip of paper. 
Holding the slip for a moment, he 
looked at it with fond, greedy eves ; 
then, with an effort, he passed the 'slip 
to Whipple. The latter’s fingers trem- 
bled, and his eyes dimmed somewhat. It 
was a check, payable to his order, for 
one hundred thousand dollars. 

"That's certified, W. J.,” said Uncle 
\\ es, ‘ and you can cash it at any bank 
in town. Spend it. I want it all used 
up in thirty days, so you can come back 
to me, broke, and get another check 
like it on June fourteenth. Then, on 
July fourteenth, you get the last one. 
But remember, don’t you lay out even 
a two-bit piece in hope of gain. Those 
are my orders. If you don’t live up 
to instructions, W. J., that first check 
will be the last one. I’ll leave the rest 
of my money to charity — some home 
for superannuated miners and prospec- 
tors, if there is any such thing. You’ll 
have thirty days to spend a hundred 
thousand dollars. Show me how you 
do it. Everybody says you’re a great 
spender, but I never learned the knack. 

I m stakin’ you to a round of pleasure ; 
now go out and make a business of 
bein’ happy. 

“I want you to be a gentleman about 
it, W. J. I know you are an honest

soul, and that you have a lot of fine 
sensibilities inherited from your mother. 
Your pa was short of ability as a money- 
maker, and some other things, but you 
got an A i inheritance of character 
from the McDougals. Squander that 
money in a genteel way, but don't let 
one sou of it make anything through in- 
vestments. Report to me often in per- 
son or by letter; you see, Fm aimin’ to 
spend my last days enjoyin' your ex-

fun out of the money myself, so Fm 
plannin’ to take my fun secondhand. 
Make it snappy, W. J. And if you caQ 
throw in a few thrills, you’ll oblige. 
When a man is packin’ for his trip 
across the Great Divide, same as me, 
a leetle excitement will make him for- 
get the trip ahead of him and be, as 
you might say, soothin’.

I want you to pick it up — real life, 
mind— the kind I’ve missed. I ” 

Faintly, somewhere within the con- 
fines of the boarding house, there 
sounded the musical notes of a triangle. 
Uncle Wes stirred restlessly. 

‘‘There goes the supper call, W. J.,” 
he said. “Hopper charges four bits a 
meal for transients. I’d like right well 
to have you stay and eat with me, but 
Fm short four bits in change. If you 
happen to have it- — ” 

“I haven't a red, Uncle Wes,” put in 
Whipple, “but my credit is good at the 
Fordham.” 

44 Your credit ought to be good any- 
where, with that paper I just gave you ; 
but the banks are closed, and Hopper 
wants cash on the nail. Maybe you’d 
better go to the Fordham. To-morrow, 
when the banks open, you can begin to 
step high, wide, and handsome. I only 
wished I was able to trot along with 
you, W. J., but it’s all I can do to walk 
from this porch to the dinin’ room. This 
heart of mine won’t let me exercise. 
Help me downstairs, and then you can 
go to your hotel and plan your campaign. 
If you put away a dollar of that money 
where it brings any interest, remember, 
you're done.” 

Whipple caught his breath once more. 
He was hardly able to realize his good 


fortune. As one in a waking dream 
he helped Uncle Wes out of the can- 
vas chair, into the boarding house, and 
down the stairs to the door of the din- 
ing room. There he thanked him 
mechanically, left him, and drifted out 
into the bright, beautiful afternoon. 
One hundred thousand dollars, all his 
own! Whipple was so dazed by it all 
that he barely missed being run down 
by a street car in Washington Street. 


CHAPTER III. 

OH, WHAT A DIFFERENCE? 

\^HEN Whipple came into the lobby 
” of the Hotel Fordham, five men 
arose from their chairs and advanced 
upon him. They had learned he was 
in town, and each had a bill. One hun- 
dred dollars would pay every cent that 
Whipple owed ; and while that was a 
large amount to an amalgamator earn- 
ing thirty a week, and with a thousand 
ways in which to lay out that meager 
stipend, it was a mere bagatelle to a 
young Croesus upon whom had devolved 
the pleasant duty of spending more than 
three thousand dollars a day for thirty 
days. Whipple dropped into a chair 
while his creditors surrounded him and 
held out their statements of account. 
Swayed by a spirit of mischief, Whip- 
ple mutely pulled his pockets inside out. 

“Gentlemen,” he said, “I came into 
town with thirty dollars, and it is all 
gone.” 

Five faces grew very long, and then 
came some peppery comments. Whip- 
ple allowed this to continue until it 
got on his nerves ; then, with a flourish, 
he brought out his certified check and 
held it under five pairs of popping eyes. 

“However,” he went on, “to-morrow, 
as soon as the banks open, I shall have 
the money. Spread the good news that 
Monte Cristo, junior, will be at Hotel 
Fordham at eleven o’clock to-morrow 
morning, loaded to the guards with ma- 
zuma and ready to meet all comers with 
a claim on him.” 

Money has a magic touch. Long 
faces broadened and sour looks faded 
into genial smiles. The boot-and-shoe 
man, the haberdasher, the jeweler who

had overhauled Whipple's watch. Cof- 
fee A1 of the short-order cafe, and the 
garage proprietor with a bill for taxis, 
all these nearly smothered Whipple with 
their kindly attentions. One hundred 
thousand dollars! The good will, 
mounting in a direct ratio with the size 
of the check, reached heights that Whip- 
ple found rather annoying. 

He was known to be a good spender, 
whenever he had the cash, or if he did 
not have the ready money, wherever his 
credit was good. But the limit of cash 
and credit, for a thirty-dollar-a-week 
amalgamator, was modest. The wealthy 
Wesley Plunkett McDougal, because of 
his known character as a tightwad, never 
had influenced the merchants in putting 
Whipple on their books. Now that Mc- 
Dougal had “loosened" in such a royal 
manner, however, every tradesman had 
cheerful glimpses of the nephew in the 
role of a princely spendthrift, and they 
began laying their plans accordingly. 
Wrenching himself clear of the enthu- 
siastic group, Whipple went in to din- 
ner. 

Every one, even the waiters, had a 
smile and a nod for him. News of the 
hundred-thousand-dollar cl\eck was 
traveling like wildfire. It hardly seemed 
possible that Old Plunks had reversed 
himself so magnificently, but every one 
who smiled and nodded had seen some 
one who had seen somebody else who 
had feasted his eyes on that oblong 
square of negotiable, certified paper. So 
the check was a fact; and the quickest 
way to get a little of McDougal's money 
was to be on a friendly footing with 
McDougal's lucky nephew. 

Later in the evening, Whipple found 
time to do a little sober thinking. In 
order to be completely strapped by next 
May fourteenth, it would be necessary 
for him to spend three thousand three 
hundred and thirty-three dollars every 
day. And he could make no invest- 
ments; all the money would have to go 
for a good time — a period of pleasure, 
snappy and full of thrills, if the ap- 
proval of Uncle Wes was to be won. 
The problem, when considered at some 
length, gave Whipple a sinking sensa- 
tion. 


On one never-to-be-forgotten eve- 
ning, the previous fall, he, had spent 
fifteen dollars and forty cents. This 
maddening round of pleasure had in- 
cluded taxicab hire, a picture show, a 
dance, and then a little supper ; and 
Katie Mingo had been his companion. 
He had given that jamboree all the 
trimmings he could imagine, even buy- 
ing Katie a bunch of flowers and a box 
of chocolates. He had considered it a 
wonderful plunge; and he recalled how 
Katie had gently reproved him for his 
extravagance. But that fifteen forty 
wasn't a circumstance to the obligations 
that faced him now. How in Sam Hill 
was he going to spend more than three 
thousand dollars a day for the next 
thirty days? 

“It can't be done!" he told himself 
gloomily. “All the pleasures I know 
anything about wouldn’t cost me three 
thousand a month in this man's town." 

Like many another man, Whipple had 
often dreamed of the fun he would have 
if some kind-hearted genie would toss 
a million dollars into his lap. Now, 
faced with cold fact, he couldn't de- 
vise ways and means for getting rid of 
one tenth of a million. He needed help. 
In a flash of inspiration he thought of 
“Concho" Charley Vandeever. By 
George, that was an idea ! 

Vandeever was an old-time friend of 
Whipple's, and his proud boast was that 
he never had anything more than a 
Stetson on his mind. Charley Van was 
a cowboy. An aunt in the East had 
died and left him four thousand dollars. 
The moment he got the money, Charley 
Van had excused himself from the 
ranch ; and in just ten days he was back 
at the Tumbling H punching cows again, 
flat broke. That feat of Concho Char- 
ley's had gone down in the history of 
the cattle country as a performance 
never before equaled ; it had even been 
perpetuated in a song entitled, “Charley 
and the Wad that Wilted," and so had 
been embalmed for all time as a lesson 
to spendthrifts. As soon as he could 
get to a telegraph office, Whipple sent 
the following message, marking it 
“Rush:" 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


9 


Charley Vandeevef, 

Tumbling H Ranch, Prescott, Arizona. 

Got to get rid of one hundred thousand 
dollars in thirty days. Come on and help. 

W. J. 

At the rate of four thousand dollars 
in ten days, Charley's supreme effort 
would have amounted to only twelve 
thousand dollars in a month. If that 
was the best he could do, then Whipple 
was leaning on a broken reed. Never- 
theless, he had confidence in Charley 
Van. His experience would be valu- 
able, and there was no telling what 
prodigal heights he might not attain if 
backed with unlimited funds. The nim- 
ble fancies of a free range would sug- 
gest ways and means for pleasuring not 
to be found within the four walls of 
a gold mill. Two heads were better 
than one in the emergency, anyhow, and 
there was nothing in Uncle Wesley’s 
instructions barring an assistant 
spender. Whipple went to bed that 
night in a fairly comfortable frame of 
mind. 

Next morning at ten o'clock he de- 
posited his check in a checking account 
and drew three thousand three hundred 
and thirty-three dollars and thirty-four 
cents. He would try his prentice hand 
at getting rid of it before midnight. 
Charley Van could not possibly connect 
with the telegram and reach the side of 
his hard-pressed friend before some 
time the following day; meanwhile, 
Whipple could experiment unaided with 
his latent powers as a spendthrift. He 
had a chance to begin just as he turned 
from the paying teller’s window. 

“Hello, W. J.!" called a voice. “Put 
'er there, son ! I've been trailing 
around for two hours trying to find 
you. Congratulations !'' 

A chunky man in a shiny Prince Al- 
bert coat, a slouch hat, and trousers 
bagged at the knees, stood in front of 
Whipple and held out his hand. He 
was middle-aged, had gray chin whisk- 
ers, and wore a pair of large, tortoise- 
shell glasses. This person had the look 
of an amiable owl, and his advances 
were more than friendly. 

“Doc Flickinger !" exclaimed Whip- 
ple, taking the hand. 


“Erasmus T. Flickinger, M. D., by 
special appointment at cut rates physi- 
cian in ordinary to that doomed and 
unhappy man, your uncle." Still cling- 
ing to Whipple's hand, Flickinger pulled 
him close and whispered in his ear : 
“Nobody'll miss him but Hopper, eh? 
Well, such is life, W. J., and we never 
know what minute is going to be the 
next. Auricles and ventricles all shot 
to pieces, and now there's a valvular le- 
sion. July fifteenth, along about three 
in the afternoon, I should say, will tell 
the story. How about a commission ?" 

“Commission?" echoed Whipple, 
freeing himself and drawing back to 
look full at the M. D. 

“Sure," went on Flickinger; “always 
customary. If I hadn’t given him three 
months you wouldn't be pulling down 
a hundred thousand a month. I’m the 
source of your good luck. Ten per 
cent, all right?" 

“You are barking up the wrong tree, 
Flickinger," replied Whipple coldly ; 
“I'm not handing anybody an honora- 
rium for giving my uncle bad news." 

“Make it one per cent then," begged 
Flickinger. “All I can pry out of Old 
Plunks is fifty cents a call. Even it 
up for me. Just a measly thousand for 
shaking this plum tree for you." 

“Fifty cents a call is about half a 
dollar more than your calls are worth. 
Not a cent, Flickinger! This demand 
of yours is worse than unprofessional ; 
it's an attempted holdup." 

With that, Whipple pushed on out 
of the bank. He had no confidence in 
Erasmus T. Flickinger, even though he 
had developed some success as a prog- 
nosticator in a patient's length of days. 
His gorge rose at the brazen demand 
for a commission on the misfortunes of 
•Uncle Wes; but out of his indignation 
there came an idea. 

Making his way to the telegraph of- 
fice, he proceeded to wire five hundred 
dollars to Doctor Mixinger, of Pres- 
cott, and request his immediate atten- 
tion in the matter of Wesley Plunkett 
McDougal. Five hundred dollars, plus 
telegraph tolls, made cheering inroads 
upon the necessary disbursements of 
the day; and Whipple could not have 


10 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


spent the money for anything that would 
have contributed more to his personal 
pleasure. 

On his way back to the hotel, Whip- 
ple’s attention was arrested by the fact 
that all Phoenix seemed to know of his 
good fortune. Somehow, it had got 
into the morning papers. He bought 
one, crossed over to the courthouse 
plaza, seated himself on a bench, and 
read the racy account of what must 
have struck the townspeople as a seven- 
days’ wonder. 

The heading ran: 

W. J. Whipple, from Three-Ply, Strikes it 

Rich. Young Amalgamator at Dowsett’s 
Mine Rides into Phoenix and Drops 
into a Fortune. Easy Come, Easy 
Go, is the String to it. And 
Uncle Wes McDougal Holds 
the End of the String. 

There, on his bench in the plaza, 
Whipple leaned back in the shade of an 
oleander and smiled a little. Was he 
becoming famous or notorious? He 
wondered, and then continued to read: 


Wesley J. Whipple, more power to his 
open hand, is said to be a spender. Well, 
W. J. has now the chance of a lifetime to 
prove it. He must spend one hundred thou- 
sand dollars a month for the next two 
months, solely for his own pleasure and 
without making any investments that might 
bring money returns; and then, if he meas- 
ures up to expectations, there will be another 
hundred thousand dollars for him to put in 
the bank, and draw on only as he needs it 
for living expenses. Query: 

Will he develop such prodigal habits dur- 
ing the two months that his third hundred 
thousand will take wings and, finally, leave 
him stranded in Dowsett’s mill with only his 
salary as amalgamator for a stake in life? 
The experiment will be watched with interest 
by the many friends of W. J. in this town. 

It appears that our wealthy townsman, 
W. P. McDougal, has discovered that he has 
only three months to live. Mr. McDougal. 
as all know, is an old prospector of frugal 
habits, who turned up a fortune when he dis- 
covered and sold the famous Letty Lee Mine 
in the Harqua Halas. Ever since that time, 
ten years ago, he has been in failing health. 
He declares that he knows how to save 


money, but has never acquired the knack of 
spending it for his own comfort and pleasure. 
So, as his days draw toward a close, he turns 
his wealth over to his nephew in liberal 
monthly installments, to be spent at the rate 
of more than three thousand dollars a day 
in the quest of joy and happiness. And Mr. 
McDougal, whose eccentricity is well known, 


asserts that by this method he will be secur- 
ing thrills and excitement by watching his 
nephew riot away a fortune. 

W. J. must be flat “broke” at the end of 
his thirty days; if he is not, the deal is off, 
and he will not receive the second stake for 
another jamboree of thirty days. And he 
cannot invest in anything that will bring 
monetary returns ; every red cent he dis- 
burses must go for comfort and pleasure; 
and the question naturally arises, how may 
a man of ingrained habits, based upon the 
spending of a hundred or so a month, blos- 
som out as the regal spender of a hundred 
thousand a month? It looks easy, but is it 
as easy as it looks? 

We extend our condolences to Mr. W. P. 
McDougal; and to his nephew, Mr. W. J. 
Whipple, also, unless he can prove, as the 
spendthrift days go on, that he is entitled 
to congratulations. 

Whipple was laughing at this story in 
the paper when he looked up to see a 
young man standing in front of him. 

“Mr. Wesley J. Whipple?” inquired 
the stranger. 

“You’ve nicked it.” 

“I am Carter Wainwright, of the Ne 
Plus Ultra Sales Company, Mr. Whip- 
ple. You’ve got a lot of money to 
spend, and the right way to begin is 
by buying a Ne Plus Ultra automobile. 
It will set you back twenty-five hundred 
dollars, but will give you twenty-five 
thousand dollars’ worth of pleasure. 
Six other automobile salesmen are wait- 
ing for you at the hotel, but I have 
stolen a march on them by overhauling 
you in the plaza. Now, the Ne Plus 
Ultra is the classiest car on the market 
to-day. It comes equipped with cord 
tires, has ” 

“All right, Mr. Wainwright,” cut in 
Whipple; “I’ll take one. Couldn’t you 
charge me more by throwing in a few 
extras?” 

“Possibly. Come over to the sales- 
room and we’ll fix you up. By George,” 
enthused Mr. Wainwright, “this is the 
easiest and quickest sale I’ve made since 
I’ve been in the business !” 

“You caught me at what they call 
the psychological moment,” was Whip- 
ple's comment. 

He arose from the bench, the sales- 
man hooked an arm through his, and 
they started for the place where the 
Ne Plus Ultras were to be had.

CHAPTER IV. 

MAKING IT FLY. 

THE superintendent at the mine had 
1 a Ne Plus Ultra car ; and Whipple, 
having a “turn” for mechanics, had re- 
paired it, and tinkered with it, and 
driven it, until there was nothing about 
the Ne Plus Ultra with which he was 
not * thoroughly familiar. So he drove 
his shiny new machine back to the Ford- 
ham, and left it out in front while he 
went into the hotel and became involved 
in the designs of a greedy mob that 
filled the lobby and had been waiting 
for him. 

He singled out his creditors and paid 
them off. Three gamblers, led by 
Montgomery King LaDue, otherwise 
“Three-card Monte/’ he summarily dis- 
missed with the emphatic declaration 
that he was “out to get a run for his 
money” and not to enrich the card 
sharps. “Mogollon” Mike Moloney, a 
poverty-stricken prospector whom h$ 
had known for years and who, at that 
moment, was particularly down on his 
luck, he presented with fifty dollars. 
Four mining brokers, with “good 
things,” in which they wanted to inter- 
est him, had their ardor dampened by 
the statement -that he wasn’t allowed to 
invest — a point they would not have 
missed if they had read the morning 
papers carefully. 

At noon he went into the dining room 
for luncheon, thrilled and cheered by 
the fact that, in two hours, he had spent 
more than thirty-two hundred dollars 
and had only a trifle of eighty-eight 
dollars and some cents left. He was 
making good, by George! He hadn’t 
found it difficult at all. 

By the time he had finished his noon 
meal another crowd had gathered in the 
lobby, each member of it primed with 
suggestions for helping him get rid of 
his hundred thousand. Evading these 
callers, he dodged out at a side door, 
reached his waiting automobile with a 
rush and a jump, kicked at the self- 
starter, let in the clutch, and was off 
for a ride through the countryside. 

The car worked like a charm; and 
just to handle the controls, and realize 


that everything from the headlights for- 
ward to the tail light aft was his very 
own, caused him the most delightful 
sensations. His afternoon spin carried 
him out along the Cave Creek Road, 
around by the Indian School, and then 
back to town again. If only Katie, or 
Mamie, or Lorena had been with him 
his enjoyment would have been com- 
plete. But which one of the three would 
he have enjoyed most to have along? 

Ordinarily his answer would have 
been Katie, but Pa Mingo’s hard jolt 
over the phone had rather dazed and 
discouraged him so far as Katie was 
concerned. And Mamie Philbrick had 
turned him down, courteously but not 
with any regret that he had been able 
to discover. Miss Lorena Marlin had 
been out of town. In the absence of 
any disconcerting word from Miss Mar- 
lin, he rather guessed that he would 
have enjoyed most her company on the 
little afternoon spin. 

In the lobby of the Fordham the 
ranks of those with designs on his 
money, had been reenforced by several 
newspaper men who were looking for 
a “story.” He refused himself to all 
of them after Felix Vannell had caught 
his ear and poured into it the informa- 
tion that three ladies were in the parlor, 
upstairs, waiting to see him. 

The wide doors of the parlor, hung 
with portieres, opened at the head of 
the -first flight. As Whipple came close 
to one of the swinging curtains, a voice 
that was very familiar struck on his 
ear: 

“I knew him first, and he’s mine by 
the right of discovery. You two may 
as well be on your way.” 

That was Lorena Marlin speaking. 
Her gurgling, musical voice, which had 
always seemed so cute and childlike to 
Whipple, had lost some of its rich ca- 
dence and was tinged with temper. He 
stopped to debate with himself, and 
more conversation drifted out to him. 

“You may have known him first, 
Miss Marlin, but when he called up last 
night and you had Serena Haskins tell 
him you were out of town, I guess that 
let you out. Oh, I got wise to that! 
Wesley will feel fine when he hears you 


12 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


were in the boarding house all the time 
and didn’t want to see him.” 

“Well, Miss Smarty, since you know 
so much I’ll tell you something that / 
am wise to. He phoned to you yester- 
day, didn’t he? And you told him you 
had another engagement, but you never 
had any callers and weren’t out of the 
house all evening. So I guess we’re 
even.” 

Whipple was terribly shaken by this 
cross fire between Lorena Marlin and 
Miss Mamie Philbrick. He had no 
business standing there and listening to 
it, but he could hardly have avoided 
hearing disclosures. Were these girls 
like all the others? Had Wesley J. 
Whipple become popular with them 
merely because of the hundred thousand 
dollars? He drew out his handkerchief 
and passed it over his moist brows. 

“I think you are just horrid, both 
of you!” 

Here came a third voice, equally fa- 
miliar to Whipple, but vastly more 
pleasing. Katie Mingo was speaking. 
Her tones expressed indignation, and 
there was nothing in them of a spiteful 
quality. Whipple clutched at them as 
at a straw of hope. 

A mocking laugh greeted Katie’s 
words. “We’re horrid, are we?” re- 
turned Lorena Marlin. “Well, how has 
your father been talking about Wes 
Whipple these last few weeks? Noth- 
ing but an amalgamator, and neveT will 
be anything but an amalgamator! Just 
a spendthrift with no eye on his future 
at all ! A good-enough fellow, but lacks 
stability! He’s called on my Katie for 
the last time, if I’ve got anything to 
say about it! That’s how your father 
feels about Wes Whipple, Miss Mingo, 
and he has published his opinions all 
over town. Step lightly, my dear; step 
lightly !” 

Whipple thought it was high time to 
appear on the scene. He coughed, 
flung back his shoulders, and showed 
himself between the portieres. A cry 
of delight welcomed him, and Lorena 
and Mamie sprang up from their chairs 
and hurried forward. Katie remained 
seated by a window and did not join in 
the demonstration. 


Lorena had black hair and black eyes, 
and Katie had flaxen hair and blue eyes, 
while Mamie was neither a brunette nor 
a blonde. All were lovely of feature 
and form, but a flash of revelation had 
shown Whipple that the characters of 
at least two of them were not so lovely. 
He bowed in his best manner. 

“Congrats, Wes!” cried Lorena, put- 
ting out her hand. 

“I always thought your uncle would 
do something for you, Wes,” Mamie 
remarked ; “and isn’t it fine ? How are 
you making it?” 

“I’m making it fly,” Whipple an- 
swered. 

“Oh, we knew you would !” exclaimed 
Lorena in her most bewitching manner. 
“You were always so generous, Wes, 
and such a decided contrast to Mr. Mc- 
Dougal. I’ve come to invite you over 
to Miss Haskins’ to dinner this eve- 
ning.” 

“And I’m here to ask you to our 
house to dinner,” spoke up Mamie. 
“And I was here first, waiting for you, 
Wes.” 

“But I have known you longer than 
any of the others!” said Lorena. 

“You weren’t out of town last night, 
Miss Marlin, and Miss Philbrick had 
no engagement.” Whipple could have 
made these statements of fact very cut- 
ting, but it was not in him to be dis- 
agreeable to the ladies. He smiled as 
he spoke. “So,” he went on, “I am 
sure you will not be very much disap- 
pointed if I tell you that I have other 
plans for this evening.” He walked 
over to Katie. “Miss Mingo,” he in- 
quired, “why aren’t you congratulating 
me ?” 

“I thought I’d wait,” answered Katie. 
“The truth is, I don’t know whether 
you are to be congratulated or not. Time 
will tell about that, Wes. If the papers 
are to be believed, the conditions under 
which your uncle is giving you the 
money may prove a handicap in the long 
run. Father wants* you to come to 
dinner at our house this evening.” 

“Then he has reversed himself? His 
opinions about me have undergone a 
change — since Uncle Wes proved so lib- 
eral?” 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


13 


Mamie and Lorena tittered. Katie’s 
fair face flushed painfully. Whipple 
was sorry at once that he had spoken 
in just that way. Before Katie could 
answer, he went on : 

“Suppose we take a ride in my new 
car and talk it over? Just out around 
Camelback Mountain. I’ll get you home 
in time for supper.” 

He offered his arm. Katie arose, put 
her hand through the arm and crossed 
with Whipple to the wide doorway. 

Mamie had lost the power of speech 
and had dropped into a chair. Not so 
Lorena; she seated herself quickly at 
a piano, thrummed a few notes, and be- 
gan to sing. He; voice followed Katie 
and Whipple as they descended the 
stairs : 

“Be-yu-ti-ful Katie, 

I’ll be waiting at the k-k-kitchen door.” 

“Oh, dear!” gasped Katie, in charm- 
ing confusion. 

“Never mind,” said Whipple cheer- 
ily. “It is a little hard to find out who 
our real friends are, sometimes; espe- 
cially,” he added, “when one happens 
to have a hundred thousand dollars to 
spend. That money of Uncle Wesley's 
is going to prove a great education to 
me.” 

They had a wonderful ride; and not 
the least wonderful part of it was 
Katie’s explanation of the way her fa- 
ther had reversed himself. 

“Father’s sentiments were never 
mine,” she told Whipple earnestly. “I 
know he has always thought well of 
you, but he has had such hard luck all 
his life that he can’t bear to see any 
one squandering money. And he has 
been in debt so much himself, that it 
fills him with horror to see a young 
man starting life — as he says — com- 
pletely surrounded with bills. He has 
watched you carefully for the last three 
years, ever since you began calling at 
our house. You — you didn’t seem to 
improve, Wes, and so he took the stand 
he did. After he talked with you, I 
tried hard to get you at the hotel my- 
self, but couldn’t. Now I’m worried for 
fear you’ll think I’m like Lorena and 
Mamie — inviting you to dinner because 


you have suddenly come into a lot of 
money.” 

“No, Katie; I’d never think that of 
you,” Whipple averred. “I’ll never for- 
get how I spent fifteen dollars and forty 
cents, once, and you called me down for 
being so extravagant. Mamie and Lo- 
rena were always urging me to go the 
limit. You’re different.” 

“Well,” Katie continued, “I don’t 
want you to come to our house to din- 
ner to-night, Wes. Father is desper- 
ately in need of ten thousand dollars, 
and I know he's planning to ask you 
for it. If you come ” 

“Bless your heart. I’ll not come,” cut 
in Whipple. “Your wish is enough for 
me, Katie. But I’d like to lavish some 
of this money on you, if I can. I’m 
to buy happiness with it; and I can’t 
think of any happier way to spend it 
than to spend jt with you.” 

“I do wish you could save it, Wes; 
save it, and use it in getting ahead. It 
isn’t right to throw away so much 
money.” 

It was almost six o’clock when Whip- 
ple halted the car in front of Mingo’s 
door, let Katie out, and then drove on 
toward the hotel. Galusha Mingo met 
his daughter as she entered the house. 

“He wouldn’t come to dinner?” he 
asked. 

“No, father,” answered Katie 
brightly. 

“You told him what I wanted?” 

“Yes,” she answered dutifully. 

Galusha Mingo rubbed his hands. 
“Then you have planted the seed, and 
it will grow and bear flower and fruit, 
my dear. We shall see what we shall 
see.” 

While he was uttering this oraculaf 
comment, Whipple was just crossing the 
street car track to drive into a garage. 
His work of driving was purely me- 
chanical, for his thoughts were all about 
Katie and the delightful two hours he 
had just spent with her. He did not 
hear the jangled warning of an ap- 
proaching street car; and the first he 
knew of his danger was a tremendous 
crash. One side of the Ne Plus Ultra 
doubled up and, wrecked and broken, 
it was rolled and pushed along the track.

TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


Whipple himself had been thrown 
through the wind shield by the impact, 
and was lying crumpled and unconscious 
in the street in front of the garage. It 
had all happened so quickly that even 
the crowds on the sidewalks were slow 
in realizing that there had been an ac- 
cident. 

CHAPTER V. 

A DAY OFF. 

\VfHIPPLE awoke to find himself ly- 
vv ing on three chairs in a drug 
store. Doc Flickinger was bending 
over him. Both arms and one foot had 
been bandaged, and Flickinger was now 
decorating his face with court-plaster. 

“Get out !” he said to Flickinger. 
“Fm all right.” 

“Light-headed,” remarked Flickinger 
to the druggist and the druggist’s two 
clerks. “As near as I can make out 
he’s got a compound fracture of the 
tibia, lacerated ligaments of both arms, 
and very grave internal injuries. Call 
the ambulance and we’ll send him to a 
hospital.” 

“No; you don’t!” cried Whipple. 
“I’m staying at the Fordham, and that’s 
where I’m going, right now.” 

With that, he got off the three chairs 
and started for the door. Although he 
limped, Wesley J. Whipple walked re- 
markably well for a man with a com- 
pound fracture of the tibia. Flickinger 
chased after him wildly, but he braced 
himself in the doorway, turned and 
shook a bandaged fist under Flickin- 
ger’s nose. 

“You’ll have some internal and ex- 
ternal injuries yourself if you try to 
trail after me,” he threatened. 

Flickinger was intimidated and fell 
back. Hatless, coatless, bandaged, and 
wearing only one shoe, Whipple turned 
a corner and walked half a block to the 
Hotel Fordham. The usual crowd of 
schemers was lying in wait for him, but 
the sight of Whipple in this gruesome 
condition was discouraging, and only 
Felix Vannell and the Chinese bell hop 
accosted him. 

“For the love o’ Pete,” exclaimed the 
clerk; “what’s the matter, W. J.?” 


“Accident,” said Whipple, “but it 
isn’t as bad as it looks.” 

“Want a doctor?” 

“No; all I want is to get up to my 
room.” 

The Chinaman helped him, got him 
to his room on the second floor, and 
would have continued his ministrations 
had Whipple not ordered him out. Then 
Whipple locked the door and proceeded 
to remove the bandages. There was 
absolutely no need of them, so far as 
Whipple could discover. The com- 
pound fracture and the lacerated liga- 
ments, so feelingly mentioned by Doc 
Flickinger, were wholly imaginary. 
Whipple kicked the bandages into one 
corner of the room and aired his opin- 
ion of Flickinger in burning words. 

He realized that he was shaken and 
bruised, and that the glass of the broken 
wind shield made necessary the three 
bits of court-plaster that decorated his 
face. Aside from this, however, he 
had suffered no injuries. Being an ath- 
letic person, and hard as nails, as the 
saying is, he had come through that 
accident remarkably well. A hand tried 
the knob of his door, then the same 
hand drummed a summons on the panel. 

It was Vannell, and he brought a coat, 
hat, and the missing shoe. “These were 
just brought to the office, W. J.,” he 
explained. 

“I’m shy fifty-eight dollars and a 
quarter, Felix,” said Whipple. “See if 
it’s in the coat.” 

It was not in the coat, and Whipple 
was forced to the conclusion that when 
he was thrown from the car he must 
have emptied his pockets into the street. 
He still had his watch and chain and 
the rabbit’s foot charm; and for these, 
and for his wonderful good luck, he 
was very thankful. 

Vannell reported that the car was a 
total wreck, that brand-new Ne Plus 
Ultra which Whipple had owned and 
enjoyed for only a few fleeting hours. 
But the situation had its amenities. 
Whipple was cleaned out of every cent 
of the money which he had drawn for 
the day’s spending. He laughed jubi- 
lantly, while the clerk looked on and 
wonclered if he was right in his mind.

“In half an hour, Felix,” Whipple 
instructed, “send my dinner up to my 
room/* 

The clerk retired and Whipple locked 
himself in again ; then he took a hot bath 
and, greatly refreshed, crawled into bed. 
When his dinner came, he ate with a 
heartiness that in no way suggested the 
invalid. About eight o’clock Vannell 
brought him an evening paper and two 
telegrams. The clerk was off duty and 
would have liked to sit down and talk, 
but Whipple made it plain that he was 
in no mood for company. 

“A lot of people have called up and 
asked about you,” said Vannell, “Ga- 
lusha Mingo among others. Mingo gave 
orders that you were not to be dis- 
turbed, and informed us that he is in 
charge of your case. That all right, 
W. J.?” 

It was pleasant to know that Katie’s 
father was taking such an interest in 
him. Whipple informed the clerk that 
it was all right, and was once more left 
to himself. 

One telegram was from Doctor Mix- 
inger : “Will run down Friday and give 
your uncle my best attention.” The 
other message was from Charley Van, 
had been sent “collect” and was charged 
against Whipple on the books of the 
hotel: “Got you, pard. We’ll go out 
and take a bird’s-eye view of the uni- 
verse. Don’t spend a red till I get there 
and show you how. Will arrive Thurs- 
day a. m.” 

Whipple went to sleep that night feel- 
ing splendidly ; but he awoke next morn- 
ing, lame and sore and with an ache 
in all his joints. He tried to get up 
and dress, but toppled back into bed 
again. It was borne in on him that 
he was doomed to take a day off, and 
that his riotous spending would have to 
be broken for a twenty-four-hour in- 
terval. At the end of that time, how- 
ever, Charley Van would be with him 
in person, and there would be two heads 
to plan and four hands to scatter the 
largess of Uncle Wes. It was a quiet- 
ing thought. 

Whipple’s reflections had mostly to 
do with Katie Mingo during that inac- 
tive day. And he happened to remember 


that her father was in need of ten thou- 
sand dollars. It occurred to him that, 
unknown to Katie, he might bestow that 
amount upon Galusha Mingo, win his 
abiding friendship, and get rid of more 
than a three days’ allowance of Uncle 
Wesley’s money. 

Galusha Mingo had studied for the 
law, only to find that he could not earn 
his salt as a lawyer. He had then given 
his attention to assaying, and now had 
a little shop about six doors from Doo- 
little’s corral. The business was not 
prosperous, and Mingo had a hard time 
to get along. He was a psychologist, 
and he brought so much of the shadowy 
science into his business affairs that pos- 
sibly the fact accounted for his failures. 
He had the faculty, nevertheless, of 
seeing good things in a business way, 
and if he had had the funds with which 
to back up his analysis of opportunities 
he might have been a rich man. At the 
present moment he was very busy with 
Whipple’s affairs; and oa Wednesday 
afternoon, about three o’clock, the angle 
of his activities was brought very forc- 
ibly and not very pleasantly home to the 
young man in room 15. 

Mr. Mingo called ; and with him there 
came a little, sharp-visaged man who 
seemed deeply interested in the state of 
Whipple’s health. * Mingo introduced 
his companion as Jules A. Forthering- 
ham, a claim agent. The lawyer-as- 
sayer-psychologist plunged at once into 
the business of the interview. 

Whipple’s brand-new automobile was 
a total wreck. It had cost him, just 
a few hours before the accident, some- 
thing like twenty-six hundred dollars. 
It was a miracle, as you might say, that 
Whipple himself had not been killed 
outright. Seemingly, he had come off 
extraordinarily well. He was feeling 
fairly well at the moment, and yet who* 
knew what might not develop in the days 
or weeks to come? Mingo had visions 
of Whipple walking with a cane or a 
crutch for the rest of his life. That 
was a possibility. The claim agent rec- 
ognized the possibility ; and he was 
ready to give a check for five thousand 
dollars, part to reimburse Whipple for 
the loss of the car, and the rest to in- 


16 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


sure the company against any further 
claims. 

“But I am all right,” asserted Whip- 
ple, “and I don't want to gold-brick 
anybody.” 

Galusha Mingo put up a restraining 
hand. Whipple thought he was all 
right, but time alone could tell whether 
he was or was not. Disease, resulting 
from the accident, might creep into his 
system in course of time and put him 
completely out of the running. 

“Then, again,” Whipple continued to 
protest, “Pm not so sure that the street 
car was at fault. I ” 

Galusha Mingo interrupted hastily to 
state that there were six eyewitnesses 
who would all swear that the street car 
was at fault. 

It is probable that heredity has less 
to do with this matter of “being square” 
than environment. The child of the 
most honest parents in the world will 
be marred for life if abandoned, in the 
tender years, to evil surroundings; but 
he will grow up a credit to those who 
bore him if right teachings are sifted 
into his environment with discrimina- 
tion and care. Whipple, in his extreme 
youth, had been well grounded in proper 
principles, and he now rebelled against 
the course along which Mingo was hur- 
rying him. 

“I don’t care about your eyewit- 
nesses,” he said; “I know that what 
happened was due entirely to my own 
carelessness.” 

That settled it. Jules A. Forthering- 
ham pushed a bundle of papers, with 
which he had been busy, back into his 
pocket. 

“This frankness is — er — most unusual 
where a soulless corporation and easy 
money are concerned,” he remarked. 
“Who was the old chap who went hunt- 
ing with a lantern for an honest man? 
He could have found his prize right 
here in room 15, the Fordham.” He 
shook hands with Whipple. “Son,” he 
went on, as he moved to the door and 
paused there, “let me tell you something : 
You can’t spend or throw away a red 
cent without making an investment ; and 
the returns are bound to be made mani- 


fest in spite of yourself. Just remem- 
ber that. Good-by.” 

Galusha Mingo, to all appearances, 
was bitterly disappointed. He turned 
on Whipple, the moment they were 
alone together, and vented his feelings. 

“Young man,” he said angrily, “you 
haven’t an idea of the value of money. 
If you ever expect to get married, what 
business have you got turning down 
a chance like that? Less to yourself 
than to the lady who will some day be 
Mrs. Whipple you are under an obliga- 
tion to get ahead. On the chance that 
my little girl might somehow be con- 
cerned in your future plans, I was try- 
ing to help you. Flickinger made out 
as good a case for you as he could — 
he was to receive ten per cent of the 
gross — and I certainly pulled the wires 
for you in masterful fashion. Now you 
have knocked everything into a cocked 
hat!” 

He started for the door. “Katie is 
grieved over this orgy of fool spend- 
ing,” Mingo went on. “She is a woman, 
and takes to heart more than she ought 
to the deliberate manner in which you 
are shattering your future. I’m going 
to send her to an aunt in Los Angeles, 
so she won’t be anywhere near this 
scene of criminal extravagance. I feel 
that it will be best.” 

He jerked the door open ; but, before 
he could leave, Whipple stayed him with 
a word. 

“I am trying to give my uncle a lit- 
tle excitement and a few thrills in his 
last days, Mr. Mingo,” he explained, as 
the other turned back. “In that desk, 
over in the corner, is a check book and 
pen and ink. May I trouble you to 
bring them to me?” 

Mingo obeyed orders; and Whipple 
wrote out a check to him for ten thou- 
sand dollars. 

“Katie told me yesterday that you are 
desperately in need of this amount of 
money,” Whipple went on, as he passed 
over the check, “and I am glad to oblige 
an old friend. I would suggest, how- 
ever, that you do not tell Katie anything 
about it. She might not approve.” 

Mingo was touched almost to tears.

‘Til — I'll give you my note, W. J.,” he 
said huskily. 

“If you do, Fll tear it up. That is 
a free gift. I am empowered to spend 
the hundred thousand in ways that will 
bring me the most pleasure. Looked 
at in such a way, if the donation means 
anything to you it means infinitely more 
to me.” 

“My whole life turns right at this 
point,” continued Mingo feelingly; “on 
behalf of my family and myself, W. J., 
I thank you from my heart.” 

“Are you still of a mind to send 
Katie to Los Angeles?” 

“On second thoughts,” returned 
Mingo, “I believe 111 leave that move 
to Katie herself.” 

CHAPTER VI. 

STEPPING SOME. 

/^)N Thursday morning Whipple was 
^ feeling much better. He was out 
of bed by seven and torturing his weary 
muscles with setting-up exercises. The 
cold bath and brisk rub down that fol- 
lowed brought a warm glow and a feel- 
ing of exhilaration. The complaints of 
his dependable nerves and sinews were 
very mild indeed, and only just enough 
to remind him that he had been in a 
collision. The patches of court-plaster, 
of course, still remained as souvenirs. 
He was busily shaving when something 
like an avalanche bumped against his 
locked door. He opened it and fell into 
the fond embrace of Charley Van. 

“Here's me, you old seed,” whooped 
the cowboy, “ready to take your little 
hand in mine and go out and put some 
fancy crimps in the big wad. Youpy-yi ! 
Things was gettin’ so monotonous down 
at the ranch that life wasn't popular at 
all. Your call reached me at the physi- 
cogical moment, as the man says. Say, 
honest, W. J., I wasn't never in better 
trim to ramble around and scatter 
simoleons than I am this minute. But 
you ain't stringin' me, are you? If that 
roundelay you're singin' is the goods, 
why are you holed up in a Jim Crow 
room like this when you ort to be in 
the bridal suite? What you shavin' 
yourself for when you ort to have a 

2 A TN 


barber in chief, a hot-towel holder, and 
a bootblack on your pay roll? Seems 
like there's somethin' wror. ; here." 

Charley Van was twenty-seven. His 
eyes were brown, and his hair was an 
auburn shade and had a tendency to curl. 
He wore a wide-brimmed hat, a gray 
flannel shirt and a pair of corduroy 
trousers; and all these various articles 
of wear, it was painfully evident, had 
seen better days. If the clothes had 
fitted him they would have improved his 
appearance, but the hat was at least two 
sizes too small, while shirt and trousers 
were several sizes too large. 

Whipple pushed his friend into a 
chair, gave him a package of cigarettes 
and, while the shaving proceeded, ex- 
plained about Uncle Wes and the 
money. He finished with an account of 
his first two days' exploits as a spend- 
thrift, and Charley almost wept over the 
good money gone with such a miserly 
return in personal enjoyment. 

“Gettin' solid with the father of the 
girl you're aimin' to marry by coughin' 
up ten thousand perfectly good dollars,” 
Charley wailed, “was about as locoed 
a play as any human ever put over. 
W. J., dads-in-law ain't quoted at much 
more than a hundred a throw, if they're 
in the market at all. You been worked; 
and I don't want you to get mad if I 
allow that more'n likely the girl helped. 
But that pufformance, star of its kind 
as it is, ain't much behind vour fool 
refusal to accept five thousand dollars 
from the claim agent.” 

“I’m not at the receiving end, 
Charley,” said Whipple apologetically; 
“I'm a disbursing agent.” 

“And all thumb-hand-side as a dis- 
burse^ I'll tell a man. Uncle Wes will 
prob'ly get excited over the way that 
ten thousand went, but I’ll gamble a 
blue stack he won't be real thrilled. As 
I figger it, you've only got about eighty- 
six thousand left. Now I got to re- 
vise my plans, and sort o' cut 'em down. 
How soon before you can stake me to 
a thousand and turn me loose for a few 
gay hours? You see, I got into a game 
o' draw, cornin' down from Prescott, 
and a tinhorn I played with corralled 
sixteen dollars that was in my clothes, 


18 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


and then the clothes. What I got on 
was donated by a capper — exceptin' the 
lid; and that I took ofFn a guy asleep 
in the smokin' car. I’ll guarantee to 
massacree a thousand plunks for you be- 
fore noon, if you'll stake me; then, 
to'rd evenin', we'll hop the fast train 
for Los Angeles." 

Whipple started. “Why Los An- 
geles?" he inquired. 

“I'm plannin' to hit a place where 
we can get value received in untram- 
meled joy for every dollar we put out," 
Charley expounded. “I'm wise to this 
game, W. J. You see, I been through 
the mill. What could we get for our 
dinero in this man's town, providin' we 
don’t play the game of give-away? 
Nothin’ to mention. We want to go 
where we can hit the ceilin', and even 
lift it a trifle. The blue sky for ours, 
W. J. I ain't had no breakfast yet. 
How long before we eat and I corral 
that measly thousand?" 

“We'll eat now, Charley," Whipple 
returned, “and I’ll give you the thou- 
sand just as soon as the bank’s open. 
Then we'll call on Uncle Wes, and I’ll 
report." 

“Mebby I hadn't better go with you 
to see Uncle Wes," Charley advised; 
“mebby you hadn’t better say a word 
about me helpin’. He might get the 
idee that your money won’t last thirty 
days, if I'm mixed up with it. And 
here's somethin' else: Suppose this new 
doc you've hired discovers that Uncle 
Wes has got thirty years yet instead o' 
three months to be with us ? I wouldn’t 
trust Doc Flickinger to analyze a case 
of distemper in a sick kyoodle — if I 
happened to own the dog." 

“If Uncle Wes is to be spared to 
live to a ripe old age," said Whipple sin- 
cerely, “it will make me happy." 

“Happy!" the cowboy jeered. “Say, 
that old tax-dodgin' skinflint will be 
after you hot blocks to get back his 
money jest the minute he finds Flick- 
inger was wrong with his figgers. We'll 
have to do a fade-out before that hap- 
pens." 

Whipple was ready for the street, and 
Charley got up and looked him over 
with a critical eye. 


“That automobile wreck didn’t do a 
thing to your oufit, did it?" he remarked. 
“You need some glad rags yourself, W. 
J. Let's eat, and then both go after the 
ready-mades." 

They had breakfast in the hotel ; and 
Charley Van sent six times for a fresh 
supply of wheat cakes. After the meal, 
they started through the lobby on their 
way to the street, but were blocked by 
another crowd of schemers with designs 
on Whipple's money. The cowboy 
made short work of them, and plowed 
his way through the press with sar- 
castic comments and a threat of using 
his fists. At an establishment where 
ready-to-wear garments were sold, they 
made their selections. The bill was four 
hundred and sixty dollars, but it in- 
cluded everything from hats to shoes. 
Each climbed into his new outfit, and 
then a clerk accompanied them to the 
bank to make sure the bill was paid. 
Whipple drew’ three thousand dollars, 
settled for the clothes, turned a thou- 
sand over to his friend, and then they 
separated. Where Charley went Whip- 
ple did not know, but Whipple himself 
made his way to Josh Hopper's board- 
ing house to make his first report in 
person. 

Uncle Wes was sprawled on the same 
second-story porch, in the same canvas 
chair, with the same bottles on the table 
and the same look of weary resignation 
in his face. 

“Then it didn’t kill you after ail, 
W. J.," he remarked, as he feebly put 
out his hand. “My money's a curse, 
ain't it? I can’t even pass it on to you 
with the curse wiped off. How much 
you spent? Twenty dollars?" 

“I've spent nearly fourteen thousand 
dollars, uncle," Whipple answered, with- 
out emotion. 

Uncle Wes furnished plenty of emo- 
tion. In fact, he almost dropped out 
of his canvas chair. 

“Another shock like that, W. J.," he 
gasped, “and my heart will stop right 

here. Fourteen thou Say, you 

never! Well, you won't get no more 
out o' me until next June fourteenth. 
You better be careful. I never spent 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


19 


that much in my hull life. How’d you 
do it?” 

The old man filled and lighted his 
pipe and composed himself for a period 
of enjoyment. But he was disappointed. 
The thrills he was expecting did not ap- 
pear. Whipple said nothing about Char- 
ley Vandeever, and dwelt only lightly 
on the amount expended for clothes. 
For reasons of a different nature he 
failed to mention the money given to 
Mingo and the five hundred sent to 
Doctor Mixinger. His story had mainly 
to do with the new automobile and the 
way it had been wrecked. 

“I never took no stock in them go- 
devils, anyways,” commented Uncle 
Wes. “I ain’t enjoyed your experiences 
any yet. What else you done, W. J.? 
Can’t you amuse me at all? There’s a 
lot more that hasn’t been accounted for.” 

Whipple grew uneasy. “My other 
expenditures, for the present, must re- 
main a secret,” he said. “You’ll begin 
to find out about them to-morrow.” 

“I’ve begun to find out about ’em 
already,” was the peppery answer. 
“Katie Mingo was here to see me, last 
evening. Give her father ten thousand 
dollars, didn’t you? That ain’t playin’ 
the game, W. J. I was right warm 
about that when Katie told me. The 
girl’s fine, but her dad is no good. What 
you done worried me last night so I 
couldn’t sleep. If I hear of your givin’ 
another cent away, I’ll make you re- 
turn what’s left. That’s right. Now 
you govern yourself according. I ex- 
pected you to have some fun with that 
money, and to pass the fun along to 
me. All I’ve got out of it, so far, is 
a bad night; and all you seem to have 
got out of it was an accident that nigh 
killed you. If you don’t do better, we’ll 
call off this hull arrangement.” 

Whipple placated his uncle as best he 
could, but when he left the old fellow 
was still garrulous and peppery. At 
half -past twelve, when he got back to 
Fordham, he found a gloomy gentle- 
man in a Panama hat, a loud and ex- 
pensive suit of clothes, and tan oxfords 
waiting for him. The gentleman was 
Concho Charley Vandeever. 


“Had some hard luck, Charley ?” 
Whipple asked. 

“Worst ever!” the other muttered, 
and began to pull money from every 
pocket of his clothes. “Ain’t it plumb 
queer how, whenever you want to lose, 
you’re bound to win? A gang, headed 
by Three-card Monte, was aimin’ to 
trim you at one-call-two. I told em 
you wasn’t built for buckin’ the tiger, 
but that I was your next friend with 
a first lien on your bank account and 
that they could lead me to the slaughter. 
Well, there was a killin’, believe me, but 
the inquest is now bein’ held on Three- 
card and his crowd. I went in with a 
thousand dollars and come out with six 
thousand in cash and I O U’s for three 
thousand more. Toughest run o’ luck 
I ever had. Say, amigo, I jest couldn’t 
lose. Ever’ time there was a jack pot 
I’d draw five and have a straight flush; 
ever’ time I held up a pair, I’d get the 
two that went with it; and if I made a 
four-card draw, like enough I’d find my- 
self with a full house! Gosh!” Charley 
Van drew a pink silk handkerchief 
across his moist and wrinkled brow. 
“Hanged if I understand it!” he mum- 
bled. 

“Serves you right for gambling,” said 
Whipple severely. “If you expect to 
clean me out with the cards, Charley, 
you’ll find it isn’t possible. Now we’ve 
got just that much more to spend.” 

“Well, don’t throw it into me, pard,” 
begged Charley. “Them I O U’s ain’t 
worth a whoop, and I’ve got a way 
to get rid of my winnin’s and to make 
a fair-sized raid on your pile at the same 
time. There’ll be a man here in a 
leather coat at two o’clock. We’ll talk 
business with him.” 

“Who is he, and what has he got?” 

“He’s a bird, and his name is Sim- 
mons, Percival Simmons; Perce Sim- 
mons, jest like that, or Persimmons for 
short. He’s a flyer, and out at the park 
he’s got a three-seater aeroplane. He 
come here to start a passenger-carryin’ 
service to Maricopa, or San Diego, or 
any old place, but no one seems fool 
enough to pay him a dollar a minute to 
get to somewhere they want to go. He’s 
pretty near broke, and all he’s got is

the machine. How about travelin' to 
Los Angeles in style ? Don't you reckon 
that would thrill Uncle Wes?” 

“How much will it cost to travel by 
aeroplane to Los Angeles ?” inquired 
Whipple. 

“Well, I reckoned we'd buy the ma- 
chine, and then give Simmons a hun- 
dred a day to run it for us. He'll sell 
for sixteen thousand, spot cash. Here's 
my six, and you'll have to put up only 
what you was fool enough to hand over 
to Mingo. How does it strike you, 
W. J., More fun than a barrel o' 
monkeys to be had out of an aeroplane. 
Always wanted to own one, but it didn't 
seem possible on forty a month and a 
dozen ways for even that. What's the 
matter with you? Feelin' faint?'' 

Yes; Whipple was feeling very faint. 
Buying an aeroplane had never occurred 
to him, possibly because the chance had 
not offered itself before. But high 
places always made him dizzy. Even 
when he climbed the gold mill to put a 
few shingles on the roof he became 
light-headed. But he had his heart set 
on Los Angeles — if Katie was going to 
be there — and he and Charley might as 
well fly as travel in the steam cars. 

“All right, Charley,” he said ; “we'll 
buy it.” 

Charley Van let out a subdued whoop 
of joy. “In this day of science and in- 
vention,” he remarked, “spendin' does 
come easy. We’ll be stepping some, 
as the man says.” 

“Stepping from cloud to cloud,” 
added Whipple; “I wish to thunder, 
Charley, we had the hard ground under 
us.” 

“Oh, it’ll be under us, W. J.,” re- 
turned the delighted cowboy ; “about 
two thousand feet down.” 

CHAPTER VII. 

THE DOCTOR TAKES A HAND. 

/^VN Friday forenoon Wesley Plunkett 
^ McDougal was in a most unhappy 
frame of mind. Dyspepsia was now 
added to his other troubles, and he was 
trying a new medicine for it that cost 
him one dollar and fifty cents a bottle. 
In addition to this cost for the medicine, 


he had been stung for some revenue 
stamps pasted on the carton which con- 
tained the bottle. He could not get over 
those stamps; they struck at his heart 
and sent the bad-temper poison pulsing 
through his whole body. He was in a 
mood to have a row with somebody, 
just on general principles. At nine 
o'clock fate sent him a visitor and gave 
him his chance. 

“Mr. Wesley Plunkett McDougal?” 

A voice with a rising inflection was 
wafted to him from the doorway lead- 
ing out upon the second-story veranda. 
It was a sharp, businesslike voice, but 
Uncle Wes did not look around. 

“What's it to you ?'' he snapped. 
“Clear out and leave me alone. I'm 
a sick man and don't want to be both- 
ered.” 

He poured himself a teaspoonful of 
the new dyspepsia medicine and care- 
fully lifted the spoon toward his lips. 
The next moment the spoon was 
snatched out of his hand, and its valu- 
able contents were scattered and lost on 
the Navajo blanket and the veranda 
floor. Uncle Wes fell back in the can- 
vas chair and glared. He tried to say 
something particularly fierce, but his 
words hung in his throat. 

A woman stood at his elbow. She 
was a middle-aged woman, tall and mus- 
cular and mightily determined. She 
wore tortoise-shell spectacles, and be- 
hind them her eyes seemed to glimmer 
balefully. Her hat was a derby; and 
she had 'on a collar, necktie, and coat 
like a man's. There was even something 
masculine about her skirt, and the com- 
mon-sense shoes just below the hem of 
it. She carried a small, square satchel, 
and her hands were large, and strong, 
seemingly very capable. 

Now the only female who ever called 
on Uncle Wes was Katie Mingo. 
Women, Uncle Wes had discovered 
early in life, were a source of extrava- 
gance and trouble. So he had denied 
himself to them. Even Katie Mingo's 
calls were few and far between. In 
his wrath and indignation he had been 
going to swear, but he held back the 
unseemly language. 

“Now you’ve done it!” he rasped.

“All of a dime’s worth of my new 
dyspepsy dope gone to blazes. Lady, 
you’d better hike, or maybe something’ll 
be said that won’t sound well. I’ve got 
to be ca’m and quiet in order to last 
three months. Another shock like that 
you just gave me, and I’m liable to 
flicker out and not go the limit. You 
heard me; I said good morning.” 

“Good morning, Mr. McDougal,” said 
the other easily, and put her satchel in 
a chair and opened it. 

Uncle Wes saw that the interior of 
the satchel bore a faint resemblance to 
a bit of impedimenta Doc Flickinger 
carried, only this outfit was more ex- 
tensive and in better condition. Uncle 
Wes leaned forward restlessly. His vis- 
itor was not leaving, but was making 
preparations to stay. 

“Darn it,” he whooped, “what I meant 
was good-by !” The strength of his 
voice rather surprised him, that morn- 
ing ; it was not as feeble as usual. 
“What’s the idee of your stickin around 
like this?” 

The woman had been bending over 
the case. She straightened erect with 
an object in her hand that had two 
rubber tubes hanging from it and writh- 
ing like a pair of black snakes. 

“I’m Doctor Mixinger, of Prescott,” 
she replied calmly, “and I’m here to 
find out what’s the matter with you.” 

This was another shock to Uncle Wes. 
He gasped and gripped the arms of his 
chair. “You can’t run in no rhinecaboo 
like this!” he cried wildly. “I know 
what’s the matter with me, and I won't 
even pay you fifty dollars to make a 
guess.” 

“Don’t let that trouble you, Mr. Mc- 
Dougal,” said Doctor Mixinger. “I’ve 
already been paid the full fee; if I 
hadn’t been, I shouldn’t be here. Now 
that I am here, I intend to do my pro- 
fessional duty. I shall be pleasant about 
it, unless you make yourself disagree- 
able; in that event,” and here her fea- 
tures sharpened and her eyes gleamed, 
“I am going to be firm and transact our 
business just the same.” 

She picked up the dangling tubes and 
pushed one into each of her ears. 

“Who paid you? Who sent you?” 


Uncle Wes cringed as he demanded the 
information. 

“Mr. Wesley J. Whipple.” 

Uncle Wes went into a tantrum. So 
that’s how Whipple was spending his 
money ! He would tell him things, next 
time he came to report. 

“Say ‘ah-h-h,’ ” said Doctor Mixinger 
quietly, bending over him and pushing 
something against his heaving chest. 

“I won’t say a blamed thing but 
what’s on my mind !” barked Uncle Wes, 
rolling his eyes. “I don’t want no lady 
doc fussin’ around me! I won’t have 
any ” 

Doctor Mixinger straightened erect 
and fire flashed in her eyes. “Don’t 
you call me a ‘lady doc/ ” she admon- 
ished; “I’m a lady, and I’m a doctor, 
but J . draw the line at doc.’ Now calm 
yourself and say ‘ah-n-h !’ ” 

Here was a command, and it was 
spoken in such a tone that Uncle Wes 
said “ah-h-h” again and again, while 
all the time Doctor Mixinger pushed 
something over his chest, and half 
closed her eyes and listened; but, while 
he was saying “ah-h-h,” Uncle Wes was 
thinking in terms that were not pretty. 
Finally the doctor smiled a quiet smile, 
pulled the rubber tubes out of her ears, 
and carefully replaced the stethoscope 
in the case. 

“That’s all, ain’t it?” queried Uncle 
Wes eagerly. 

“Not quite,” was the answer. 

Doctor Mixinger pulled up a chair, 
seated herself, leaned forward, and 
looked him full in the eyes. It was a 
probing look, and Uncle Wes felt a 
shiver going through him. 

“Give me your left hand,” said the 
doctor. 

“You ain’t goin’ to hold my hand! 
I never yit ” 

Uncle Wes yielded his left hand, and 
cringed again as the lady doctor’s soft, 
firm fingers caressed his bony wrist. 
“H’m,” mused the doctor, sitting back 
a moment later and studying the pa- 
tient with a speculative stare. 

Uncle Wes grabbed at his pipe and 
tobacco. Savagely he filled the bowl 
and struck a match. “How much longer 


22 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


you goin’ to stay ?” he asked, as he sur- 
rounded himself with a fog of vapor. 

“Just long enough to get you on your 
feet, so be patient. Who has been look- 
ing after you?” 

“Doc Flickinger.” 

A faint smile showed at the corners 
of Doctor Mixinger’s lips. “What does 
he say?” she inquired. 

“He gives me three months. Next 
July fifteenth, sometime along in the 
afternoon, I'm a goner.” 

“What are those bottles on the table ?” 

“All that keeps me alive,” returned 
Uncle Wes sharply. 

“Does Doctor Flickinger prescribe 
that stuff for you?” 

“Well, he says it's helpin’.” 

“Helping to kill you.” Doctor Mix- 
inger got up, stepped to the table, and 
lifted the bottle containing the dyspep- 
sia medicine. She looked at the label, 
removed the cork, and smelled the con- 
tents ; then coolly, deliberately, she 
threw the bottle over the veranda rail, 
and it smashed to fragments on the 
ground below. “That’s the best place 
for that,” she observed calmly. 

Uncle Wes went into a flurry. He 
raged about the dollar and a half and 
the extra few cents for the stamps. 
While he was raving, three other bot- 
tles went over' the rail. He grabbed 
for the last one, but was not quick 
enough. Utterly beside himself with 
rage, the old prospector jumped out of 
his chair and began prancing up and 
down the veranda; now and then he 
would pause and look over the railing 
and moan at the sight of the broken 
glass and wasted medicine. 

“Say,” he quavered, “if I had a gun 
I surely would ” 

Doctor Mixinger drew a small, gleam- 
ing automatic pistol from one of her 
pockets. “You haven’t one handy ?” she 
said. “Well, I always make a practice 
of carrying one. You see, I have to 
travel a good deal and meet all kinds 
of people. Sit down, Mr. McDougal.” 

The automatic was pointed carelessly 
in the general direction of Uncle Wes. 
He grew quiet instantly and slumped 
into his chair again. 


“How long have you been like this?” 
went on the doctor. 

Uncle Wes moistened his lips with his 
tongue and tried twice before he could 
answer; then he managed to say: “Ten 
years.” 

“Ten years lost,” murmured Doctor 
Mixinger, “and just when you ought to 
be in your prime. Any appetite ?” 

“Not a particle,” returned Uncle Wes, 
his fascinated eyes on the automatic 
which the doctor continued to hold in 
her hand. “All I can eat for breakfast 
is about six slices o* bacon, a couple 
o’ slabs of bread, three or four eggs, 
and two cups o* coffee. That’s every 
last thing my stomach’ll take in the 
morning. Can’t eat enough t® keep life 
in a chipmunk.” 

“How about dinner and supper ?” the 
doctor went on. 

“I do better at dinner, quite a little 
better. Supper’s only jest a snack — 
mebby a hunk o* cold roast, and a pot 
o’ tea, and two or three pieces o’ pie. 
Last night I had cakes and sirup, and 
I never slept a wink. I’m turrible bad 
off to-day, and now you’re makin’ me 
a lot worse. W. J. has sent you up to 
kill me,” he added accusingly. 

“How much exercise do you take, 
Mr. McDougal?” 

“I don’t dast exert myself too much, 
Doc Flickinger says. If I was to try 
to walk around the block, I’d drop in 
my tracks before I got halfway. ’Bout 
all I navigate is to the dinin’ room for 
breakfast, out here till dinner, then to 
the dinin’ room ag’in, then back here 
till supper, then the dinin’ room, then 
along about nine I totter off to bed. 
All I can do to make it, sometimes. 
Plumb shot to pieces, that’s the trouble 
with me. I reckon you can see it, can’t 
you ?” 

“Get up, Mr. McDougal,” ordered 
Doctor Mixinger. “You and I are go- 
ing to take a walk around the block. 
Never mind your shoes; those slippers 
will do. You don’t need a hat, either. 
Come on.” 

“No!” shouted Uncle Wes, horrified. 
“You’re aimin’ to lay me out cold. 
Don’t p’int that gun at me! Go ’way, 
or I’ll call the police. I can’t ”

“Come on !” 

Doctor Mixinger’s eyes flashed, and 
she leveled the automatic. Uncle Wes 
staggered to his feet. With the doctor 
right behind him he reeled across the 
veranda and through the doorway into 
the hall. 

“Brace up !” ordered the doctor. 
“Throw your shoulders back, breathe 
deep. Don’t hang on to the banister as 
you go downstairs. There, that’s right. 
Now, then, keep step with me.” 

Down on the sidewalk, the neighbors 
had a glimpse of Uncle Wes, hatless 
and in his old slippers, moving along at 
the side of Doctor Mixinger. Josh 
Hopper stared after the two from his 
front steps. He wagged his head fore- 
bodingly. 

“She’s killin’ him !” he said to him- 
self ; “I reckon I might as well call the 
undertaker. This is awful !” 

As Doctor Mixinger and Uncle Wes 
rounded the block, the doctor steadily 
increased the pace. When they got back 
to Hopper’s front door Uncle Wes had 
to gallop to keep up; but he noticed, as 
he climbed the stairs and returned to 
the second-story veranda, that he was 
not breathing much faster than usual. 
He was astounded. 

“Well,” remarked the doctor, with a 
laugh, “you didn’t drop, did you? Mr. 
McDougal, either Flickinger has scared 
you or you have scared yourself. You 
haven’t any more heart trouble than I 
have. What you need, and all you need, 
is exercise — physical and mental. That 
is your proper tonic. Forget your 
health, take on a hobby, or find some 
compelling purpose, and follow it with 
all the enthusiasm you can muster. You 
must have an object in life that will 
make you think and stir around.” 

“Then — then I ain’t goin’ to die in 
three months?” asked Uncle Wes, faint 
with wonder. 

“You are going to die in about thirty 
years, providing you smoke less and 
stop dosing yourself with those patent 
nostrums. You are perfectly sound ; 
and that is quite remarkable, consider- 
ing the way you have coddled yourself 
for ten years. I never saw a man of 
your age who was potentially more ca- 


pable of getting the utmost out of life. 
But cut loose and be active. This is a 
bright and happy world, and you are 
perfectly competent to get your full 
share of the brightness and happiness.” 

While talking, the doctor had been 
closing the little square case. Straight- 
ening, she turned and held out her hand 
in a friendly way. 

“I was paid five hundred dollars to 
come here and tell you this,” she con- 
tinued, “and you ought to be grateful 
to your nephew, for it is the best ad- 
vice you have ever had. I beg your 
pardon for displaying the pistol, but I 
think you’ll admit that you were a dif- 
ficult case and hard to handle. I trust 
there are no hard feelings. Good-by.” 

Uncle Wes took the offered hand; 
then, startled by the great truth that 
had suddenly dawned upon him, he 
.watched wide-eyed while Doctor Mix- 
inger vanished through the doorway. 

“Ten o’ my best years plumb wasted !” 
he muttered, kicking over the canvas 
chair. “Run around that block without 
so much as ketchin’ my breath ! Nothin’ 
the matter, not a thing, except the want 
of exercise! I ” 

He broke off abruptly as his eyes, 
happening to cross the veranda railing, 
encountered Doc Flickinger moving on 
the boarding house from up the street. 
Flickinger was coming to make his cus- 
tomary morning call on Uncle Wes. 
The eyes of the old prospector nar- 
rowed, and his face grew hard. 

“There’s the cimiroon that done more 
to make me waste them ten years than 
any one else on earth !” he growled. “I 
reckon I’m due for a little more exer- 
cise,” he finished, and crouched beside 
the door leading to the second-story 
veranda. 

CHAPTER VIII. \ 

A COMPELLING PURPOSE. 

A SERIES of shocks that jarred the 
boarding house from underpin- 
ning to roof lifted Josh Hopper out of 
his chair and carried him at a double 
quick to the second floor of his estab- 
lishment. Mrs. Hopper, and Pedro, the 
man of all work, joined him as he 
raced. When the three of them arrived 


24 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


on the upper veranda, what they saw 
made them almost doubt the evidence 
of their senses. 

Uncle Wes, the confirmed invalid, had 
Doc Flickinger flat on the porch floor, 
and was pinning him there with two 
knees on his chest. In a fury, Uncle 
Wes was bumping Flickinger’s head on 
the hard boards while Flickinger begged 
for mercy. 

“Yes,” roared Uncle Wes; “I'm 
feelin’ quite well this morning, doc. 
No; this exercise ain't hurtin’ my heart 
a particle, but seems to be right soothin'. 
I reckon you needn’t call any more. 
You see, I’ve made up my mind to live 
thirty years instead of jest three months. 
I'm convalescin’ fast. Ain’t you glad 
to see how I’m recuperatin' under your 
treatment ? Ain't you ?” 

Mr. and Mrs. Hopper and Pedro 
flung at him and, with their united ef- 
forts, managed to heave him clear of 
the prostrate Flickinger. The latter, 
bounding to his feet, fled for the stairs, 
the street, and safety. He left his hat, 
spectacles, and his medicine case behind. 
Uncle Wes flung them after him over 
the railing, and the medicine case jingled 
merrily as it struck the ground. 

“What on earth is the matter ?” wailed 
Mrs. Hopper hysterically. 

Uncle Wes leaped into the air and 
let off a whoop. “I'm a well man, that’s 
what’s the matter!” he declared. “I’ve 
come to, and got wise to how Flickinger 
was stringin' me along. That lady doc 
— doctor — sort of opened my eyes. She 
made me do things that Flickinger said 
I couldn't do without passin’ out. Oh, 
my gorry, what a fool I’ve been! You 
can have your second-story porch, Hop- 
per; I’m done with it.” 

He ran to his room, kicked off his 
slippers, and began putting on a pair 
of shoes. Then he got into clothes 
which he had made it a practice to wear 
only on Sundays. He had a compelling 
object in mind. Now that he was a 
healthy man with thirty good years 
ahead of him, he realized his mistake 
in giving the hundred thousand dollars 
to his nephew. His business was to 
overhaul W. J. and recover as much of 
the money as possible. Dinner was 


ready by the time Uncle Wes was ready 
for the street, but delaying to eat while 
W. J. was spending with an open hand 
was out of the question. Uncle Wes 
reasoned that the faster he hurried the 
more of his good money he would re- 
cover. 

The sight of Wesley Plunkett Mc- 
Dougal, traveling at speed along the 
streets of Phoenix, caused the old-timers 
to rub their eyes and wonder if they 
were “seeing things.” It was ten years 
since anything like that had happened 
before. It was an incredible perform- 
ance for one whose days were said to be 
numbered. “Must be flighty,” was the 
general comment; “he ought to be cap- 
tured and taken back to Hopper’s.” But 
no one tried to capture him. There was 
a look in the old prospector’s face that 
warned against interference. 

He came to the Hotel Fordham, 
dashed through the street entrance, and . 
ran to the counter behind which Felix 
Vannell stood and blinked. 

“Where’s my nephew, W. J. ?” de- 
manded Uncle Wes. “Tell him I’m here 
and want him pronto. Get a move on, 
young feller, because this is mighty im- 
portant.” 

“W. J. left here bright and early this 
morning, Mr. McDougal,” replied the 
clerk. 

Uncle Wes dropped his elbows on the 
desk and bowed his tall form across it. 
“Where’d he go?” he barked. 

“Him and Charley Vandeever started 
for Los Angeles, where the chances for 
spending money in a big way are a lot 
better than they are here.” 

This was a terrible wrench for Un- 
cle Wes. He stifled a groan. Physi- 
cally there had been a change in him, 
a complete transformation, but men- 
tally he was the same old tightwad. The 
thought that W. J. had already escaped 
and was on his way to a big and ex- 
travagant city, where the rest of the 
hundred thousand would melt away like 
dew in the morning sun, was a blow be- 
tween the eyes. Uncle Wes came out 
of his daze to inquire: 

“Wh — what train did he take? I can 
overhaul him with a telegram. Hurry 
What train did he leave on? And 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


25 


what’s he doing with Charley Van- 
deever ?” 

“I think he called in Vandeever to 
help him get rid of his money ; and they 
didn’t leave by train. They bought one 
of these aeroplanes for sixteen thousand 
dollars and hired the chap that owned 
it to take them to Los Angeles. They’re 
paying that pilot a hundred dollars a 
day. Didn’t you see the papers this 
morning? They’re full of it.” 

Uncle Wes groaned again. He stag- 
gered. Then he thought of the bank in 
which W. J. had deposited the money. 
On a forlorn chance he went there and 
instituted inquiries. He was informed 
by the cashier that Whipple had drawn 
out all the money in his account, taking 
it in thousand-dollar bills. 

When he left the bank, Uncle Wes 
felt like a beaten man. He had his 
health, and he had a lot of money left, 
but it hurt him to the soul to see the 
remains of that hundred thousand dol- 
lars getting away from him. Back at 
Hopper’s he made his plans to go to Los 
Angeles by train, and be there to meet 
W. J. and Vandeever when they ar- 
rived. Hopper, however, explained to 
him that the aeroplane traveled so fast 
that it would probably be in Los An- 
geles before Uncle Wes could get a 
train out of Phoenix. Uncle Wes sud- 
denly had an idea. 

‘Til send a telegram to the chief of 
police in Los Angeles,” he said, “and 
have W. J. and Vandeever arrested the 
minute they come down. That’ll stop 
’em. They won’t be able to spend any 
money if they’re in jail. Jest as soon 
as I learn they’ve been arrested, I’ll go 
to Los Angeles myself, get back what’s 
left of my money, and tell the police 
to turn ’em loose.” 

He went to the courthouse and talked 
with the sheriff; then the sheriff got 
busy and wired the Los Angeles police 
department. Following this there was 
a period of waiting. Feeling that he 
had made an excellent move, Uncle Wes 
grew calm. He read the papers, and 
learned how W. J., accompanied by the 
irrepressible Charley Vandeever, had 
bought the aeroplane, hired the pilot, 
and taken flight from the city park. 


This sensation divided honors, in the 
daily press, with a big bank robbery at 
Eudora, Arizona, in which three ban- 
dits had made a daylight raid and es- 
caped with sixty thousand dollars in 
cash and Liberty Bonds. The bank was 
offering five thousand dollars for the 
capture of the robbers, and ten per cent 
of all cash and bonds recovered. This 
affair interested Uncle Wes only be- 
cause it claimed the attention of the 
local sheriff, and gave him less time to 
devote to W. J. and Vandeever. Uncle 
Wes haunted the sheriff’s office, waiting 
for news of the arrest of his nephew 
and Vandeever, and made himself a 
nuisance. 

One day, two days, passed and still 
the aeroplane had not reached Los An- 
geles; nor had it reached any other 
known port of call, east or west, north 
or south. A deep, dark mystery had 
suddenly fallen over that aeroplane. 
After leaving Phoenix it had neither 
been sighted nor heard of. Probably, 
the opinion ran, it had been wrecked 
somewhere on the deserts or in the 
mountains and would never be heard of 
again. 

Then, on the third day after the fly- 
ing machine had left Phoenix, among 
the suspicious characters brought in by 
the sheriff and his posse to be questioned 
regarding the Eudora robbery, was a 
weazel-faced ne’er-do-well known to be 
a side partner of the gambler, Three- 
card Monte. He told a story, after a 
session of the third degree, that let in 
a flood of light on the spenders bound 
for Los Angeles. 

Three-card Monte, it seemed, had 
subsidized the pilot of the aeroplane and 
won his consent to land his passengers 
on Saddleback Flats at the edge of the 
Estrella Mountains. This was a lonely 
hole in the hills, inhabited solely by 
scorpions, tarantulas, and sidewinders. 
But the gambler and some of his friends 
would be at Saddleback Flats, if not 
when the aeroplane arrived at least 
shortly thereafter, and their plans were 
to annex every dollar carried by W. J. 
and Vandeever by fair means or foul. 
The discovery that Three-card Monte 
and his confederates had left by fast 


26 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


automobile in the general direction of 
Saddleback Flats, the very morning the 
aeroplane had hopped off, corroborated 
the story told by the informer. 

Deputy sheriffs started at once for 
Saddleback Flats. They refused to let 
Uncle Wes ride in their car, but his 
enthusiasm for an active role in recov- 
ering his money spurred him to hire a 
flivver and follow on to the Flats. Ga- 
lusha Mingo went with him; and, al- 
though it was manifestly no work for 
a woman, Katie Mingo insisted on going 
with her father. Katie was wild with 
apprehension over W. J., and Uncle 
Wes had not the heart to insist that 
she stay at home, especially since Mingo 
was bearing rather more than his share 
of the flivver's hire. 

This second party got away three 
hours after the deputy sheriffs had 
started. 

“We'll all be too late," hazarded Ga- 
lusha Mingo gloomily. “More than 
likely, Three-card Monte and his gang 
have got the money and are in parts 
unknown by this time." 

“I've had a lesson," mourned Uncle 
Wes; “I'M hang on to my money, after 
this, and not fool it away on a spend- 
thrift nephew." 

“But, oh, what do you suppose has 
happened to W. J.?" wailed Katie. 

“Don't fret about him, Katie," said 
Uncle Wes, with whom Mingo's girl 
was a prime favorite ; “he'll be back in 
Dowsett's gold mill, before many days, 
working for thirty a week, as usual. 
He's a McDougal, after all's said and 
done, and nobody ever yet made him 
hard to find." 

CHAPTER IX. 

NO CHANCE TO GET OUT. 

T'HE aeroplane had been named by 
1 Percival Simmons the Ace High ; 
and since a hand in a poker game with 
nothing but ace high seldom wins, Sim- 
mons' name for his flyer was not much 
of a recommendation. Neither Whipple 
nor Vandeever, however, drew their 
speculations out so fine. The former 
paid ten thousand, and the latter six 
thousand, and when the Ace High 


hopped off at Phoenix that bright Fri- 
day morning it was their property ; and 
the former owner was on their pay roll 
at one hundred dollars a day. 

Whipple had turned the balance of 
his bank account into cash, and he had 
with him, on taking the air in his fly- 
ing start for Los Angeles, seventy-five 
one-thousand-dollar bills and a hundred 
plus in small change. It was enough, 
certainly, to finance a tolerable round 
of pleasure for two wandering spend- 
thrifts. 

The three passengers were distributed 
in separate cockpits along the backbone 
of the Ace High — Simmons in front, 
just back of the propeller, then Whipple, 
and then Vandeever. Just before the 
take-off, Whipple had overheard Sim- 
mons making inquiries about the Es- 
trella Mountains and Saddleback Flats. 
This struck him as queer, and he had 
asked the pilot why he was so interested 
in that particular part of the country. 
Simmons answered that he merely 
wanted to use the mountains and the 
flats as a landmark while conning his 
course. 

Whipple was surprised to discover, 
as soon as they were in the air, that he 
was not in the least dizzy. There was 
a deafening clamor in his ears. This 
was continuous and made conversation 
impossible. And when he got out from 
behind his wind shield to look overside, 
a frightful rush of wind tore the breath 
out of his lungs. But there were no 
unpleasant sensations, and all his doubts 
about the aeroplane being a good “buy" 
were dissipated. 

Thirty minutes after the start, a sun- 
baked wilderness, destitute of human 
life, was unrolling beneath the Ace 
High at the rate of a hundred miles an 
hour. Whipple knew that a mountain- 
ous country lay below, but viewed from 
overhead it seemed flat, and every high- 
flung butte and peak had no more vis- 
ible elevation than a cactus clump. 

Simmons kept constant watch, pre- 
sumably looking for landmarks. Why 
this was necessary, at that stage of the 
journey, was incomprehensible to Whip- 
ple. A compass course due west was 
all that was needed. The pilot, never- 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


27 


theless, seemed anxious and worried, 
and at last confused. He dipped lower, 
in order to get a clearer view of the 
country; and then he lifted higher, cir- 
cled, and cut figure eights miles long, 
twisting and turning and falling and ris- 
ing until Whipple lost all sense of di- 
rection and could only judge the way 
they were traveling by taking a slant at 
the sun. 

Charley Van was likewise puzzled by 
these maneuvers. He leaned over to 
yell something in Whipple's ear. After 
several attempts he made it manifest to 
Whipple that he did not like the pro- 
ceedings, and that they were losing time 
with all those curlicues when they ought 
to be whooping it up on a straightaway 
course; and wouldn't W. J. just yell 
that into Simmons' ear, order him to 
point for Los Angeles, keep going, and 
oblige. 

Whipple leaned over his wind shield 
and shouted at the aviator’s helmeted 
head the joint objections of the two 
owners of the machine to the man they 
had hired to run it. Simmons answered 
something, but Whipple could not un- 
derstand what it was. With one hand 
on Simmons’ leather-clad shoulder, with 
the other Whipple indicated a westerly 
direction. The pilot nodded, nosed the 
machine skyward, and started again on 
the proper course. 

For ten minutes everything went 
beautifully; and then, all at once, the 
terrific din of the propeller failed in 
a swift diminuendo. Presently, only 
the screech of the wind could be heard 
among the taut wires and stays. There 
could be talk now that was clearly heard. 

“What’s the idee, Simmons?" de- 
manded Charley Van. 

“Engine trouble of some kind," an- 
swered the pilot, his hands passing 
swiftly over the controls; “motor's 
dead, and I can’t get a kick out of it.” 

“Then what?" inquired Whipple, with 
a sinking sensation. 

“We've got to volplane down. Look 
for a place to land, both of you. If 
we can't find the right kind of a place, 
we're all done for." 

This was pleasant news! The Ace 
High was corkscrewing downward in 


wide circles, and the ground below 
seemed to be jumping up at it, greedy 
for a collision. With wide, fearful eyes 
Whipple and Vandeever were trying to 
discover a level stretch of ground among 
the tumbled mountain peaks. 

“Can you see anything of Saddle- 
back Flats?" yelled Simmons wildly. 

“We’re miles to the west of them 
flats !" Charley Van roared at him. 
“The country down there looks to me 
a heap more like the Gila Bend Divide 
than the Estrellas. Oh, by glory ! Sim, 
you've sure got me all mixed up. Hit 
the flat desert, can't you ?" 

“We can't hit anything but those 
peaks,” was the pilot's answer; “can't 
you see anything that looks level and 
smooth, down there? Use your eyes!" 

With sickening rapidity the saw-tooth 
crests of the hills leaped at the Ace 
High . 

“There’s a canon !" cried Whipple, as 
the flying machine cut across the yawn- 
ing mountain chasm at perhaps five hun- 
dred feet. 

“And a flat at the bottom of it!" 
added Vandeever. “Can you drop into 
that gash and 'light on the flat?" 

“I got to,” answered Simmons, be- 
tween his set teeth; “if I don’t it's all 
over but payin' the bets." 

He manipulated the falling machine 
in such fashion that the nose of it was 
brought in line with the north and south 
trend of the canon; then, straightening 
out, the plane rushed downward. They 
cleared the two steep walls of the gash 
and, by a turn to the left, hit the flat 
with a shock that almost threw Whipple 
and Vandeever out of their cockpits. 
The flyer lurched and wabbled over the 
rough ground, finally halting with a 
crash. Whipple took a header into the 
air, landed on one of the wings, rolled 
down the steep slope of it, and off the 
end in a six-foot fall on a nest of 
bowlders. There he curled up quietly 
and went to sleep. 

He awoke to find Charley Van throw- 
ing water in his face. “How you feelin', 
W. J. ?" inquired the cowboy anxiously. 

“A good deal like I did when the 
street car hit me," answered Whipple 


28 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


in a faint voice. “Don’t waste all that 
good water, Charley ; give me a drink.” 

Vandeever limped away, bent down 
over a small stream, refilled his Stetson, 
and came back. 

“Ain’t this fierce?” he commented 
gloomily, as Whipple gulped the water 
over the hat’s brim. “I reckon this 
flyin’-machine deal was a mistake, W. 

J” 

“Where’s Simmons?” asked Whipple. 

“Who cares a hoot about Sim?” 
snapped Vandeever. “He sold us a sky 
boat with a bum engine, and now see 
what’s happened. I allow if he broke 
his neck we wouldn’t be much more’n 
even.” 

“No such luck,” came the melancholy 
voice of the pilot. 

He was sitting on a bowlder, minus 
his helmet and leather jacket, and was 
knotting a handkerchief around his left 
forearm, using his right hand and his 
teeth. 

Whipple had been dragged clear of 
the rock pile, and he now sat up and 
took a look around. He was at the 
edge of a flat, and the flat was at the 
bend of the canon. The walls of the 
defile were high and straight up and 
dow T n — merely smooth precipices. A 
small stream babbled over the rocks of 
its narrow course, and in the sandy 
stretches were rank growths of mes- 
quite. The Ace High had run head on 
into the canon’s east wall. The left- 
hand planes had been crumpled up by 
a big cottonwood tree, and the front 
end of the machine had been crushed 
as far back as the pilot's cockpit. Sim- 
mons surely had been lucky to escape 
alive. 

“Think you can fix up the old cata- 
maran, Sim?” inquired Vandeever. 

“Not hardly,” was the sarcastic re- 
sponse; “she’s a total wreck. Landing 
gear all smashed, propeller all in pieces, 
port planes in smithereens, and engine 
knocked into a cocked hat. When we 
get away from here we’ll have to walk.” 

“Walk!” yelled the exasperated Van- 
deever. “Do you know what sort of 
country lies between us and civilization ? 
’Bout 'steen hundred miles of desola- 
tion, with nothin’ to feed on but chuck- 


wallas and nothin’ to drink but the juice 
of niggerhead cactus. Walk! Man, 
we never could make it. If your old 
pop bottle had to give out, why didn’t 
it pull the play within hailin’ distance 
of Phoenix? Here’s an elegant mess o’ 
fish!” 

Whipple got up and balanced himself 
dizzily on his legs. “Let’s look around 
and get our bearings,” he suggested. 

“That’s somethin’ to do, anyways,” 
Vandeever assented. 

They moved northward toward the 
upper end of the canon. Simmons did 
not go with them, but sat disconsolately 
on his bowlder and began spiritlessly to 
manufacture a cigarette. 

“He don’t need to worry a hull lot,” 
remarked Vandeever ; “he’s got his six- 
teen thousand, so bustin’ up the Ace 
High don’t mean a thing in his young 
life. It didn’t take us long to get rid 
o’ that bunch o’ money, anyways. Plumb 
wasted, and nothin’ to show for it. W. 
J., this is a right discouragin’ canon, if 
anybody asks you. Look at them walls ! 
A hundred feet straight up, and even 
a squirrel couldn’t get from here to the 
rim rock. And there’s the north end 
— it is just like the side walls. I move 
we take a look over south.” 

The north end of the canon was 
closed by a sheer precipice. The little 
stream, hitting the wall, sank out of 
sight under it, flowing through a sub- 
terranean channel. 

“Wait a minute,” called Whipple, 
halting his companion who was about 
to turn back. “What's this?” 

On the smooth surface of the end 
wall some hand had rudely inscribed 
with red pigment: “Lost Creek Canon. 
No chance to get out. Bottled up. — 
Johnson Blue.” 

Vandeever read the inscription, gave 
a howl of despair, and threw up his 
hands. “Lost Creek Canon ! By glory, 
that does settle it! W. J., we’re planted 
for keeps.” 

“What do you mean, Charley?” 
Whipple asked. 

“Ain’t you never heard tell of John- 
son Blue over to the Three-ply ? Ain’t 
no one ever mentioned Lost Creek 
Canon around Dowsett’s mine ?” 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


29 


“Not that I remember.” 

“Say, listen. This here is a pocket 
there ain’t no gettin’ out of. Once here 
you’re here to stay. Only it’s as hard to 
get into as it is to get out of, mostly. 
Johnson Blue got into it with ropes, 
explorin’ like, and the ropes got loose 
and come down on him. A carrier 
pigeon he had with him got back to 
Prescott with the news, but the message 
was weather-beaten and dim in spots. 
The location of Lost Creek Canon 
wasn’t readable, and people hunted for 
it for months, hopin’ to save Blue. But 
he wasn’t never saved. I reckon, if 
we look, we’ll find what’s left o' him 
around here some’rs.” 

Vandeever took off his hat and 
slammed it down on the rocks; then 
he leaned against the sheer wall and 
laughed huskily and mirthlessly. 

“And here’s you and me,” he went 
on, “loaded to the brim with dinero and 
aimin' to cut loose with it in Los An- 
geles, bottled up in Lost Creek Canon, 
without no carrier pigeon or ropes or 
nothin'. We’re jest plumb cast away, 
that’s all ; and when we’re laid out cold, 
the birds'll get them thousand-dollar 
bills and line their nests with 'em.” 

He laughed again, and the walls of 
the canon gave back the nerve-wracking 
echoes. 

CHAPTER X. 

A MESSAGE FROM THE PAST. 

'T'HE north end of Lost Creek Canon 
* was cheerless, forlorn, and offered 
a despairing prospect; but a “find” was 
made around the bend in the south end 
that put heart in the three castaways. 

The walls here were steep and un- 
scalable, and a lofty barrier thrown 
across the defile made of it a complete 
cul-de-sac. Here Lost Creek found it- 
self, bubbling up from beneath the foot 
of the barrier, flowing the length of 
the canon, and losing itself again at the 
other end of that tremendous blind 
alley. 

The surroundings south of the bend 
were not so depressing. The walls were 
hung with trailing vines, which gave a 
bowerlike aspect to that part of the 
mountain prison; and there was a flat 


covered with a thick growth of oaks and 
pinons; and in the heart of this grove 
Whipple and Vandeever stumbled upon 
their big surprise — a small but comfort- 
able log cabin. 

That cabin could not have been built 
by Johnson Blue, discoverer and origi- 
nal castaway of Lost Creek Canon. It 
was seven years, according to Van- 
deever, since Blue’s homing pigeon had 
fluttered into Prescott, and the cabin 
was plainly of very recent construction. 
It stood empty and deserted, and there 
was no path leading to its door. The 
door was not secured in any way, but 
opened readily to Whipple’s hand. 

The single room within was marvel- 
ously equipped for comfort. Three 
bunks furnished with blankets and pil- 
lows were built against the walls. Three 
chairs stood around a small table; and 
in a cupboard, plates, cups and saucers, 
knives, forks, and spoons continued to 
carry out this remarkable grouping of 
threes. 

Charley Van pulled off his hat and 
ran his fingers through his hair. “Looks 
like somebody had been gettin' ready 
for our party,” was his comment. 
“Wouldn’t this jest nacherly rattle your 
spurs, W. J.?” 

In a second cupboard was found a 
bag of flour, strips of hacon, a box of 
potatoes, and a generous supply of 
canned goods. There was a stove, too, 
in one corner of the room, with pots 
and pans hanging all around it, and 
even a supply of firewood piled beside 
it. 

Charley Van collapsed into one of 
the chairs. “Here’s once, I’ll say, that 
our cup was right-side-up and caught 
a little good luck when it rained trou- 
ble. W. J., we didn’t outfit ourselves 
with so much as a ham sandwich when 
makin’ that start for Los Angeles in 
the sky-hooter; so if Mrs. Class A. 
Luck hadn’t dropped this cabin and con- 
tents down in the canon for us, we’d 
sure have starved plumb to death. 
Everything's so new the worms haven’t 
even got in the prunes. We can draw 
out the agony for quite a spell, I’m 
figgerin'.” 

“Charley,” returned Whipple, “this 


30 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


pocket in the hills isn't so blamed in- 
accessible as you have been trying to 
make me believe. Somebody came here 
and fixed up this place, calculating to 
make a home out of it” 

“You've seen for yourself, W. J.,’’ 
Vandeever returned, “that there ain't 
no gettin' out of here unless we sprout 
wings. I’ll admit that hombres could 
come down on a rope, same as Johnson 
Blue done, but without that same rope 
gettin' out is goin' to bother a heap." 

“Three men built this cabin and got 
it ready to live in," Whipple went on; 
“and that wasn't so long ago, because 
everything is fresh and new. They 
must be planning to come back here 
very soon. Well, Charley, when they 
come, we'll use their means for getting 
into the canon to get out of it. All 
we have to do is to wait." 

“Cheer-o !" exclaimed Vandeever. 
“Here's hoping toe get our chance to 
pull out before your thirty days are up 
and you are left stranded with that 
bundle of kale. We'll have to spend 
faster than I reckoned on when we do 
hit Los Angeles. Now, bein' hungry 
and the like o' that, how about gettin’ 
Simmons over here? He was braggin’ 
about how he can cook. Suppose we 
start him in?" 

“All right; go get him." 

Vandeever found Simmons still sit- 
ting on his bowlder, very much cast 
down. “Don't you forget," were his 
first words to Vandeever, “that I'm still 
drawing my hundred a day." 

“That's a mere baggytelle, Perce," re- 
turned the cowboy; “was you stringin’ 
us when you said you could cook?" 

“I’m a regular chef," boasted Sim- 
mons ; “and I was sitting here thinking 
how I could eat if there was only any- 
thing eatable in sight." 

“Well, chirk up ; we're goin’ to feed. 
Come on and I'll show you." 

When the cabin and its supplies burst 
on his vision the aviator was astounded. 
Whipple was building a fire in the stove, 
but Vandeever pulled him away from 
the work. 

“Sim tells me that he expects us to 
pay him the hundred a day, whether 
we're flyin’ or laid up in this canon," 


said Vandeever. “By doin’ the cookin'* 
and taking care of the ranch I calcu- 
late that he’ll make all of five dollars 
a day, anyways, so I move we let him 
do it You and me, W. J., will jest sit 
around and fret because the spendin’ 
is so poor. Get busy, Sim !" 

Among the supplies were two or three 
dozen packages of cigarettes, several 
pounds of smoking tobacco, and half 
a dozen decks of cards. Vandeever 
made these discoveries and announced 
them joyfully. 

“W. J.," he whispered to his friend, 
“with my luck at the pasteboards, it’ll 
be blamed little of that hundred a day 
Sim'll ever see." 

Simmons proved that he was really 
a capable cook by preparing an excel- 
lent meal. All were in better spirits 
after they had eaten their dinner. While 
Simmons was clearing away the empty 
dishes, Vandeever tumbled into one of 
the bunks for a nap, and Whipple 
roamed around the flat. 

It seemed to Whipple as though there 
must be some way into that canon and 
out of it. The stories about Johnson 
Blue’s imprisonment in that mountain 
pocket might be far-fetched. Whipple 
was not so credulous as Vandeever 
seemed to be, so he went hunting for 
a possible avenue of escape. 

He failed to find it. The walls, 
masked with trailing vines, were as pre- 
cipitous as the bare rock faces in other 
parts of the canon. Whipple wondered 
if the vines were strong enough to bear 
his weight. He learned that they were 
not; for, essaying a climb by means of 
the festooned creepers, he sustained a 
fall of a dozen feet and gave up his 
attempts. 

As he moved around the edge of the 
flat his foot kicked against something, 
and he stooped and picked up a small 
tin box. The box was scarred and 
worn, and locked. He broke it open. 
Inside of it was an open-face silver 
watch, with a leather fob and an elk’s 
tooth charm attached to it, eighteen 
cents in change, a comb and brush, a 
pocket knife, and a memorandum book. 
Sitting down at the foot of an oak he 
fell to examining the various objects. 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


31 


On the back of the watch was the 
monogram, “J. B.” The same initials 
were engraved on the handle of the 
knife. 

“Relics of Johnson Blue,” thought 
Whipple, and picked up the little book. 

On the flyleaf he read this, written 
in a firm, businesslike hand: 

Johnson Blue, late of New York City, now 
of Nowhere in Particular: His impressions 
of life, based on the way in which he lived 
it, and written for his own amusement while 
he slowly starved to death. 

This was gruesome, but it held a 
fascination for Whipple. Blue really 
had been bottled up in that canon. He 
had sent out his carrier pigeon, hoping 
for rescue. Rescue had not come, and 
famine had claimed him for a victim. 

“What you got, W. J.?” 

This was Vandeever. Having fin- 
ished his nap he had gone searching for 
Whipple. The latter told him what he 
had found, and how he had chanced 
upon it. 

“By glory !” the cowboy exclaimed, 
sitting down at his friend’s side and 
looking with deep interest at the watch, 
the knife, the military hair brush, and 
the comb. “Eighteen cents! He was 
mighty nigh busted flat, wasn’t he?” 

Whipple read from the flyleaf of the 
book. 

“Purty tough !” commented Van- 
deever, with feeling. “And we might 
have starved allee same as Blue if some- 
body hadn’t built that cabin for us and 
filled it with supplies. Poor old Blue! 
He must ’a’ been blue them last days. 
I can’t imagine nothin’ worse than 
havin’ hunger get you. Read about 
them impressions of his, W. J.” 

Whipple began to read : 

“No help has arrived, and I have come to 
the conviction that the carrier pigeon failed 
to reach Prescott. That means that my days 
are numbered. The chuckwallas are not very 
plenty, and not very appetizing. In the hey- 
day of my wastrel year, I remember how 
squab on toast, chicken a la Maryland, and 
roast canvasback duck palled on my jaded 
appetite. If I had my million back, I would 
give all of it for one dinner at Shanley’s! 
I have kept pulling up my belt a notch until 
it makes a circle no bigger than a dog’s col- 
lar — and not a very large dog’s collar at that. 

“But why repine? I have had my fling, 


and here I am holed away among the bleak 
mountains with my large fortune dwindled 
to a pitiful eighteen cents ! I’m a good ex- 
hibit in the case of Gal Life versus A Sen- 
sible Existence; I am a horrible example in 
the matter of what not to do with a million 
dollars; and I feel the urge to put some of 
my philosophy down with pen and ink. No 
one will ever see it, but the mere writing 
will be a relief to my mind, and will serve to 
beguile this period of waiting for the end. 
And I have an idea that I can make my finish 
the finest things I have done in all my riotous 
year.” 

“Gosh!” exclaimed Vandeever, as 
Whipple paused reflectively. “Now 
whyever do you suppose he was writin’ 
like that, W. J.?” 

“I’ll read on,” answered Whipple, 
“and see if we can find out.” 

“I was a happy man before my Uncle Ezra 
died and left me that million dollars in hard 
cash. Kept books for Halloran & Beezley, 
and received a hundred dollars a month for 
it. Got along beautifully; put aside a little 
every week for a rainy day, and had enough 
left to ride over to Coney of a Saturday 
afternoon and take some real enjoyment. 
And I’d get away to the Polo Grounds oc- 
casionally, and yell myself hoarse over a 
good ball game. 

“And there was Ethel! There are fine 

f 'rls in this land, but none finer than Ethel. 

wish she might know what has finally 
happened to me, but that is hardly possible. 

If I had taken her advice But I’m not 

sobbing about that, or anything else. I 
mixed this dose of medicine for myself, and 
I’m going to swallow it with a smile. 

“Back in the old days, though, I was happy. 
And I didn’t know it! I lived in a little 
paradise all my own, and I was getting 
ahead at the rate of about three hundred a 
year. Then a snake crawled into my para- 
dise, a snake with glittering golden scales 
and diamond eyes — Uncle Ezra’s million dol- 
lars. 

“I didn’t have to work any more. That’s 
what I told Halloran & Beezley. Work was 
for those poor fish who had no uncle to die 
and leave them a million. I started out to 
put some new brightness in the Gay White 
Way. They said I made good. I had friends 
everywhere, and they did their best to make 
me forget I had ever been a hundred-dollar- 
a-month bookkeeper. 

“Is it much of a trick to run through a 
million in a year? Not in a town like New 
York, wet or dry. When a man who, now 
and then, has to walk to save car fare, wakes 
up with a million in his mitt, maybe he’ll 
still walk to save car fare — but I doubt it. If 
he is young, as I was, and if he has abilities 
as a spender, as I had, he’ll probably buy 
himself a flock of automobiles and never 
walk any more than he just has to. 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


I scattered the million in twelve months: 
and now here am I, I, far from the bright 
lights, a prisoner in these hills and with 
only eighteen cents in my pocket. I’ve a fine 
case of dyspepsia— and roasted chuckwallah 
doesnt agree with a finicky stomach. I’m 
all rusty from lack of exercise— and I came 
to Arizona for the mountain cure everlast- 
ingly too late. It’s time I died, and— r-” 

Vandeever reached over, jerked the 
book from Whipple’s hands and threw 
it angrily out across the flat. 

“I reckon that’ll be all of that!” he 
growled. “Now that we got our pock- 
ets full o’ money, I ain’t in any mood 
to listen to such stuff. Gol-ding-it, I 
hadn’t a notion Blue was that kind of 
a ciiniroon.” 


“Looks like he was hitting at us, eh, 
Charley ? ’ queried Whipple. 

“I’ll tell a man ! And it ain’t a fair 
go, either. Why inmlazes did you have 
to kick that tin box out o’ the brush, 
W. J.? , But Blue wasn’t the same as 
you. It’s in your uncle’s contract that 
you got to spend. Blue wasn’t obliged 
to do what he done. He was goin’ on 
his own when he got down to them 
eighteen cents. Ain’t some people 
plumb foolish?” 


Whipple and Vandeever, at the foot 
of the oak in Lost Creek Canon, sat 
brooding in deep thought over the fool- 
ishness of Johnson Blue. What angle 
was taken by their vagrant thoughts is 
no matter ; but presently the cowboy got 
up, walked sheepishly over to the little 
book, and picked it up and dusted it off. 

“Take care of it. W. J.,” he said, 
handing the. melancholy record to his 
friend. “Like enough, after all, you 
and me will get eighteen cents’ worth 
o’ fun out o’ readin’ it. If he goes 
into his spendin’ habits, maybe there’ll 
be a tip for us when we get to Los. 
W’e’ll have to work fast if we’re held 
up here for much of a spell.” 


CHAPTER XI. 

A CHANGE OF PLANS. 

r pHAT little book of Johnson Blue’s 
wielded an uncanny influence. 
Two days after it had been found all 
three young men in the canon had come 
under its mystic spell. When Whipple 


was not reading it aloud to his compan- 
ions, either Vandeever or Simmons was 
sure to have it and to be deeply im- 
mersed in its contents. 

The sorry chronicle was less than five 
thousand words in length. In giving so 
much time to it, therefore, the cast- 
aways were continually rereading parts 
of the manuscript. Each had his fa- 
vorite passages; and Whipple, curious 
to know just what appealed most to 
Vandeever and Simmons, took up the 
little book as each laid it down. In 
Vandeever’s case, his clews were vari- 
ous leaves bent at the corners ; and, in 
Simmons’, a pencil checking of sundry 
paragraphs. 

It developed that the cowboy’s inter- 
est was held by Blue’s ingenious meth- 
ods of extravagance. He would charter 
a sumptuous private train, for instance, 
and take a large party of friends to 
some prize fight in the Middle West; 
or he would buy a private yacht, spend 
a riotous month in the West Indies, and 
then sell the yacht for less than half 
what he had paid for it. He would 
give dinners to boon companions, at 
which diamond and platinum stick pins 
were passed around as favors. Once, 
in Florida, he had rented an entire ho- 
tel for a week, living in it in lonely 
grandeur with every employee at his 
beck and nod. An extravagant eccen- 
tricity was never to wear the same suit 
of clothes twice, but give away each 
suit when it was taken off. 

Simmons’ marked passages consisted 
largely of philosophical deductions. "A 
false friend is one who shares your 
bounty, battens on your favors, and then 
fails to recognize you when your money 
is gone. He is a deceiver and a thief.” 
And this : “A crook is the physical mani- 
festation of a crooked soul, warped by 
greed and a hunger for easy money. 
Better that a man should have a mill- 
stone hung about his neck and be flung 
into the sea than to profit in such a 
way.” And again: “Not money, but 
the love of money, is the root of all 
evil. Because of this we betray a trust 
and land in jail, or we commit murder 
and hang. One who loves money for 
itself is capable of any atrocity.”

Whipple, on his own part, was en- 
tranced with the whole tragic story, 
but his pet paragraphs were some of 
Blue’s platitudes, such as: “Waste not, 
want not,” and “Be careful with what 
you earn, and doubly careful with what 
is given you and “Stand on your own 
feet; he beholden to no man for so 
much as a nickel;” and “Spend wisely, 
but save with even more wisdom; for 
a tightwad is anathema and a wastrel 
is a lost soul ;” and, lastly, this price- 
less ruby in the casket of diamonds: 
“Be not lured by relatives or friends 
or strangers into ways of wasteful ex- 
travagance ; for an act repeated becomes 
habit, and habit becomes second nature, 
and second nature becomes character, 
and character makes us what we are 
for better or for worse.” 

All this, to some minds, would have 
been a mere collection of rubbish. It 
is quite possible to understand why the 
last writings of Johnson Blue might 
appeal to Whipple, and why a cowboy, 
eager to master all the fine arts of get- 
ting rid of money, might be interested 
in them, but that Percival Simmons 
should ponder such passages as he had 
marked was an incomprehensible mys- 
tery. 

Johnson Blue, with just money 
enough left to get him to some out-of- 
the-way corner of the country, had come 
to Prescott. Like Timon of Athens he 
yearned for some desert place where he 
could forget the ingratitude of those 
whom he had believed to be friends and 
kill all thoughts of the girl Ethel who 
had married a better man. So he bought 
a burro, a grub stake, several hundred 
feet of rope, a homing pigeon in a 
wicker cage, and set out for the heart 
of the hills. His idea was to immure 
himself on an island in the air, a sup- 
posedly unscalable mesa called Encan - 
tada that had come to be a legend in 
the Southwest. His purpose was to get 
away by himself, burn all his bridges, 
and even cast off the ropes by which he 
had hoped to gain the mesa's top. Then, 
if he tired of his hermitlike existence, 
he would send word back to Prescott by 
means of the carrier pigeon, and some 
one would come and effect his rescue.

It was a wild fancy. He failed to 
find Mesa Encantada, but he did hap- 
pen upon a pocket in the ground as dif- 
ficult of access as any island in the air. 
With his ropes he managed to get into 
it, but the ropes loosened and came down 
on him before he had lowered the re- 
mainder of his supplies into the canon. 
Weeks later, his half -starved burro wan- 
dered into Wickenburg; this, however, 
was long after the carrier pigeon had 
made its home port with a damaged 
message that told of Blue’s plight, but 
failed to define his exact whereabouts. 

So, from Blue’s last writings and in- 
formation given by Vandeever, Whip- 
ple pieced the story together. Some- 
how, the thrill of it grew on him as 
the days passed. It seemed to grow on 
the cowboy and the aviator as well. 
Knotty problems offered themselves to 
the castaways. 

Were they destined to reach the end 
of their provisions and come to a 
wretched end, there in Lost Creek 
Canon, as Blue had done? Who had 
built and furnished that cabin on the 
flat with supplies for three? On the 
answer to this second question hung 
their hopes of deliverance. A week 
passed, however, without bringing the 
owners of the cabin. Vandeever, for 
once in his life at least, had something 
more than his Stetson on his mind. 

“By glory,” he complained, “we’ve 
lost a hull week, here in this hole in 
the hills, waitin’ for some one to come. 
We’ve got to stop coolin’ our heels, 
W. J., and try to find a way out. Grub 
is goin’ fast, and I move we meander 
around and try to find them ropes of 
Blue’s. Maybe they haven't rotted clean 
to pieces, and we can use ’em in gettin’ 
clear o’ this blamed pocket.” 

So they went hunting for the ropes. 
But they had vanished completely. 
When absolutely certain that they were 
not to be found, further attempts were 
made to climb the wall by means of the 
hanging vines. The vines were fragile, 
and after Vandeever had taken a bad 
tumble the maneuver was given up as 
hopeless. 

Simmons raided the wreck of the 
Ace High and removed and spliced to- 


34 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


gether a number of guy wires. The 
resulting cable proved too stiff and un- 
wieldy and nothing could be done with 
it. In desperation, another forlorn 
search for the ropes was begun. It was 
while this was going on that Simmons, 
creeping along at the edge of the flat 
under a festoon of trailing vines, found 
a small wicker cage with its door un- 
latched. 

This recalled Blue to the minds of 
the castaways. Here, undoubtedly, was 
the very cage in which he had kept his 
carrier pigeon. Vandeever, fired with 
a sudden thought, dropped to his knees 
and continued investigations at that part 
of the foot of the cliff. He crept 
through the vines, was lost to sight for 
five minutes, and at last emerged into 
view with a white face and wild eyes. 

“I touched ’em,” he gasped, drawing 
his sleeve across his wet forehead, “and 
they — they rattled. Oh, my glory!” 

“What rattled?” demanded Whipple. 

“Bones ! He's in there — Blue, what's 
left o' him. Never had such a start in 
my hull life, W. J. He's layin' under 
a bit of an overhang, and he grinned 
up at me all white and — and — well,” he 
finished, “I jest had to have air. Mil- 
lion-dollar Blue is jest a pile o' bones 
in a khaki suit. Say,” muttered Van- 
deever, “don't it give you a start, W. 

J.?” 

“Sure,” answered Whipple, “but 
we’ve got a duty to do, Charley. That's 
a great little book he wrote, and the 
least we can do is to bury these bones 
away in the pleasantest part of the flat. 
Look ! Here's his fountain pen. I want 
it for my own, this and the eighteen 
cents. You can take the watch and 
knife, and Simmons can have the fob 
and the elk-tooth charm.” 

“Who gets the book?” 

“We’ll draw cuts for that. Get Sim- 
mons now. We’ve got to do the best 
we can, Charley.” 

The three men got to work, and in 
a short time all that remained of John- 
son Blue had been decently interred, to 
the best of their ability. 

Poor Johnson Blue! For one brief 
year everything he had wanted had been 
his. Now there he lay, and of what 

i 


use to him were all the millions in the 
world ? 

Whipple sat down. “Everything has 
been said that can be said, I take it,” 
he remarked, “about a fool and his 
money. Now and then, at the bitter 
end, a fool wakes up and says, or writes, 
a number of wise things. And we three 
would be fools if we did not profit by 
them. If we ever get out of this canon, 
Charley, I make a solemn vow to give 
back to Uncle Wes the rest of his 
money. I'm going to tell him that I'm 
not fitted for the job he set for me.” 

“Then — then you ain't goin’ to Los 
Angeles at all?” inquired Vandeever 
plaintively. 

“I'm going back to the Three-ply 
Mine to work in the gold mill.” 

“Then me for the ranch, if that’s how 
you stack up,” said Vandeever. “I've 
got mucho plenty of this canon and that 
book of Blue's. His writing’s have 
plumb robbed me of all the pleasure I 
might have had helpin’ you spend your 
uncle's money. I reckon the boys will 
gi'me the laugh, but they can't sing that 
old chantey about the Wad that Wilted 
— because it won’t stick.” 

Simmons was having a struggle with 
himself. At last he managed to get the 
better of his feelings and observed, in 
a strained, unnatural voice : “I got some- 
thing to say, men. Three-card Monte 
LaDue hired me to drop you on Saddle- 
back Flats. He and two of his pals 
were to be waiting there and corral the 
kale you two had with you. I was to 
have a share in it. But I missed Sad- 
dleback Flats, somehow ” 

In two jumps Vandeever was in front 
of Simmons. “I had a notion more’n 
once you was playin' crooked !” he 
yelled. “Now, then, you two-faced 
sidewinder, right here’s where I beat 
you up !” 

Whipple hastened to step between 
them. “No,” he said sternly; “hands 
off of Simmons, Charley. He didn’t 
make anything by his treachery; and 
here, where we’ve put away Johnson 
Blue, let’s bury our animosity along with 
some of our fool ideas.” 

Vandeever was red and wrathful. 
Not ordinarily could he have been

halted, in such a manner, by the restrain- 
ing hand of a friend; but there was a 
spirit of peace abroad in the canon at 
that moment — the spirit of Johnson 
Blue. 

“All right, Simmons," said Vandeever 
to the aviator, “you ain't the only one 
in this bunch that made a stumble. You 
must not " 

At that instant, Whipple leaped at 
Vandeever and Simmons and pulled 
them down. He was excited, and a wild 
light gleamed jn his eyes. 

“Look!" he whispered, pointing to- 
ward the vine-clad wall. “They're com- 
ing! The men who built and stocked 
that cabin are here! Watch!" 

CHAPTER XII. 

THE PART OF WISDOM. 

'T'HE descending sun, slanting over the 
* western rim of the canon, bright- 
ened the eastern wall. The brightness 
was rising toward the top of the wall, 
leaving the foot of the cliff in shadowy 
twilight. Some thirty or forty feet up 
the face of the precipice, full in the 
sun's rays, the mask of greenery had 
been opened and men could be seen 
working through the gap. 

Evidently these men had found foot- 
hold on a shelf concealed by the hang- 
ing vines. At the distance from which 
they were viewed by Whipple and his 
companions the forms were indistinct, 
although it could clearly be seen that 
there were three of them. 

“Say, this is bully!" exclaimed Van- 
deever, all the joy of a prospective de- 
liverance rising in his soul. “As they 
climb in, we’ll climb out. Like enough, 
horses brought them through the hills 
to the canon; well, we'll arrange to use 
them caballos for the trip back to 
Phoenix. Here's luck !" 

He started across the flat in the di- 
rection of the cliff where the newcomers 
were at work, but Whipple caught his 
arm. 

“Not so fast, Charley. Let’s wait 
here and watch for a while. There’s 
something about that cabin that never 
looked just right to me. It will be bet- 
ter, I think, to let those fellows get 


down into the canon before we show 
ourselves to them. They might decide 
not to come on if they found strangers 
here." 

Vandeever looked thoughtful. 
“Strikes me you’re too blame cautious. 
W. J.," he said, “but mebby it’s jest as 
well to play safe." He drew back into 
the tree shadows and continued to fix 
his gaze on the wall. “There’s a path 
down that cliffside, back o' them vines, 
right to the p'int where them hombres 
are workin'," ran his comment, “and 
mebby that's the way Johnson Blue got 
in. But how do you reckon they found 
it? We never guessed there was a shelf 
part way up the wall, did we?" 

“It wouldn't have done us any good 
if we had," put in Simmons. “That shelf 
is all of thirty-five feet straight up, and 
we had no way of getting to it. By 
Jupiter, look at that!" 

Something was tossed out through 
the gap in the vines. It twisted, 
writhed, unfolded, and dropped down-, 
ward, resolving itself into a long rope 
ladder. As soon as it was in place, the 
three men descended from the shelf, 
one by one, and landed on the flat. By 
that time the whole canon was plunged 
in gloom, although the eastern rim rock 
still glimmered under the sun's rays. 

“Wait till they get to the cabin," 

Whipple suggested, “and then we’ll walk 

in on them. They'll light up, and we'll 

be able to give each other a good siz- 
• _ »> 
ing. 

“We’ll give ’em a big surprise," 
chuckled Vandeever, “if I know any- 
thing about it." 

The newcomers trailed like shadows 
across the flat, making straight for the 
cabin. Whipple, Vandeever, and Sim- 
mons followed them at a distance. 

“I'll bet a blue stack," the cowboy 
hazarded, “that they’ve got a mine down 
here; placerings, like as not." 

“There’s no gold in Lost Creek 
Canon," averred Whipple; “I've been 
keeping an eye out for that ever since 
we got here, and the formations aren’t 
right." 

“What’s their idee in cornin’ here, 
then?" 

“That’s what I’d like to know. Men

TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


aren't going to all this trouble in Lost 
Creek Canon unless they have some- 
thing up their sleeves. It doesn’t look 
right, Charley.” 

The newcomers had reached the cabin, 
and lamplight suddenly glowed in the 
cabin windows. Whipple and his two 
companions pushed on hurriedly and 
stepped in through the open door. They 
were greeted by a yell that indicated 
surprise and anything but friendliness. 

“I'm a Digger if it ain’t Concho 
Charley, the cattle-puncher gent as got 
to us for all that dough in the back 
room at Hennessy’s !” whooped a voice. 

“Sure it’s him !” cried some one else. 
“And he’s bringin’ his pard, Monte 
Cristo, junior! Surprisin’ luck, if any- 
body asks you.” 

“Simmons,” a third person demanded, 
“how did you happen to miss the flats, 
the other morning? And how did you 
happen to know about this canon, and 
get here and be waiting for us with 
these lambs of the golden fleece? You 
seem to have played your cards pretty 
well, but I’ll be hanged if I can under- 
stand it.” 

Whipple was amazed. The last 
speaker was Three-card Monte LaDue, 
a trim-looking blackleg in fancy moun- 
taineer clothes. The two with him were 
his roughneck pals, “Pecos” Pete 
Geohegan and “Silver” Sam Horna- 
day. All in all, they were about as hard 
an outfit as ever drifted through the 
Arizona hills. Each of the three was 
well armed and, at the moment, had a 
vicious six-gun on display. 

What weird turn of fate had brought 
these men into that lonely canon? 
Whipple wished, then, that he had been 
even more cautious. Bound for Los 
Angeles on a quest for spendthrift 
pleasures, neither he nor his companions 
had carried anything in the way of fire- 
arms. Three-card and his partners were 
holding all the trumps, that hand. The 
surprises were mutual, but every ad- 
vantage lay with the newcomers. 

“You’re a fine lot of coyotes, ain’t 
you now?” Vandeever remarked with 
fine sarcasm. “You planned to trim me, 
there in the back room at Hennessy’s, 
but I galloped off with every sou you 


three had in your clothes — matchin’ my 
run o’ luck ag’inst every nickel-plated 
holdout in your tinhorn crowd. Then 
you schemed to get it all back, by one 
way or another, and missed the bet. 
Oh, you’re a fine outfit of sobbers!” 

Three-card Monte smiled in the oily 
way characteristic of him. “We’re not 
missing any bets here in Lost Creek 
Canon, Concho,” he purred. “Why 
didn’t you come down at Saddleback 
Flats according to agreement, Sim- 
mons?” he demanded, whirling on the 
aviator. 

“They got wise to me” — here Sim- 
mons nodded toward Whipple and Van- 
deever — “and it wasn’t safe. Then the 
engine of the old boat went back on me, 
and we just happened to land in this 
canon. I’m glad you got here, Three- 
card. It’s the best piece of luck that 
ever came my way. Whipple and his 
pard would have killed me, I guess, if 
I hadn’t had help.” 

Cold rage rose in Vandeever’s heart. 
“Ain’t you sorry now, W. J.,” he asked, 
“that you didn’t let me beat him up? 
Sim has been playin’ off on us.” 

Whipple was nonplused. At the 
grave of Johnson Blue, such a short 
time before, he had felt that Simmons’ 
confession and regrets were sincere ; 
but now he had executed a direct about- 
face, and was one of Three-card 
Monte’s crowd. He made this certain 
by stepping to the other side of the cabin 
and joining the ranks of the gamblers. 

“How much have they got with them, 
Simmons?” queried LaDue. 

“Seventy-five thousand in cash,” was 
the prompt reply. 

“Good ! I didn’t know but they might 
have hidden it away somewhere. Put it 
on the table, Whipple, every last stiver 
of it.” 

“Don’t you never, W. J. 1” roared 
Vandeever. “Let’s show ’em our teeth. 
If they get that dinero, make ’em fight 
for it!” 

He picked up a chair and backed into 
a corner. 

“Concho,” remarked LaDue calmly, 
“when you and your outfit dropped into 
this canon, you came within one of put- 
ting a crimp into the smoothest cam- 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


37 


paign I ever planned. You found a neat 
little cabin here, well stocked with sup- 
plies. You and your friends jumped 
right in and took possession of it. I'm 
not finding any fault with that; but I 
want to assure you that while we're 
here you and Whipple are going to stay 
here. I expect to make this place my 
headquarters for the next six months. 
Show fight, Concho, and we’ll drop you 
in your tracks. Put down that chair." 

“Don’t be foolish, Charley/’ said 
Whipple; “all the odds are against us." 

This easy yielding wasn’t at all like 
Whipple, as Vandeever knew him; so 
the latter reasoned that his friend had 
something at the back of his head in 
the way of a ruse. Strategy, that was 
what it must be. Building his hopes 
on that, Vandeever lowered the chair, 
sat clown in it gloomily, and watched 
while Whipple put all of Uncle Wes- 
ley's money on the table. 

“That’s the part of wisdom, Whip- 
ple," observed Three-card Monte with 
unctuous approval. “You might also 
sit down, for the moment. Pecos,” he 
went on, “you go back to the shelf and 
pull up the ladder. You'll have an un- 
comfortable night, up there, but we've 
got to make sure that Whipple and 
Concho don’t clear out and tip off this 
new roost of ours to the sheriff. We 
can’t let that happen, you understand, 
until we’re through with the canon. 
Silver will relieve you in the morning, 
and to-morrow night Simmons or I will 
pull up the ladder and sleep on the 
shelf. Don’t forget, Pecos," LaDue 
finished, “that there’s a bundle of money 
in this for all hands." 

The mention of money stifled the 
grumbling of Pecos. He put away his 
gun, pulled up his belt, and left the 
cabin. Three-card Monte approached 
the table and coolly appropriated the 
crisp bank notes that lay there. 

“This should mean little to you, 
Whipple,’’ said he easily. “You’re get- 
ting rid of it quickly, and with a few 
thrills that ought to interest Old Plunks. 
Sorry to dispossess you, but we’ve got 
to have the cabin. You and Concho can 
bunk down on the flat. We'll see that 
you don’t starve; at least, while we're 


here in the canon with you. When we 
leave for good — well, that will be an- 
other matter." 

“Got a mine here, Three-card?" in- 
quired Vandeever. 

Hornaday laughed hoarsely. 

“Well, you might call it that,” re- 
turned LaDue with a twisted smile. 
“Pecos must be on the shelf by now," 
he added, “so you two can clear out. 
Don’t try any foolishness, either of 
you." His voice sharpened as he 
launched the warning. “I’m playing for 
a big stake, and won’t stand for any 
nonsense on your part. Good night. 
I’ll send you something to eat in the 
morning." 

Whipple and Vandeever walked out 
of the cabin, followed by the jeers of 
Silver Sam Hornaday and Percival Sim- 
mons. As they moved away across the 
flat, leaving behind them the cabin and 
its comforts, the cowboy complained bit- 
terly about the aviator. 

“He ort to be killed ! W. J., I’d have 
evened up our score jyith him if you’d 
only have let me alone a while back. 
Now see how he has turned on us. 
Johnson Blue’s book never got to him 
the same as it did to you and me." 

Whipple drew closer to his irate 
friend. “Charley," he whispered, “I 
believe Simmons is still on our side, 
and that he’s pretending to stand in with 
LaDue in order to be of help to us." 

“Never in this world !’’ declared Van- 
deever emphatically. “Was that the rea- 
son you w r as so pesky meek in shellin’ 
out them thousand-dollar bills? If I’d 
’a’ thought you was bankin’ on that. I’d 
’a’ fought till I dropped. Simmons is 
a two-faced, measly coyote. It’s all off 
with that noble idee o’ yours to give 
back the dinero to your uncle. But that 
ain’t worryin* me so much as gettin’ 
clear o’ this tough outfit and takin’ a 
slant for Phoenix.” 

“We’ll get back the money before we 
leave the canon," asserted Whipple. 

“How?" 

Whipple did not know how, but he 
believed there would be opportunities 
and they would be able to manage it. 
He led the way through the gloom to 


38 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


the overhang where Johnson Blue had 
pitched his dismal camp. 

“Aimin' to sleep in there, W. J.?” 
demanded Vandeever. 

“Why not? It gets pretty cold at 
night, and we must have some kind of 
shelter. What was good enough for 
Blue ought to be good enough for us." 

Whipple went down on all fours and 
crawled through the swinging vines. 
The cowboy followed him, finally, but 
not without many protests. 

“Pll bet the place is ha’nted," he mut- 
tered. 

“Well, it couldn't be haunted by a 
kindlier spirit than Blue's. I'm greatly 
obliged to Johnson Blue, Charley. He 
has shown me how to look wisely at 
some of the problems of life." 

“Huh !" grunted Vandeever ; “he was 
only a spender that got cold feet when 
his money was gone. Mebby you'll 
sleep, but I'll be hanged if I think I'm 
goin' to. 'Night, pard." 

CHAPTER XIII. 

A BIT OF ACTING. 

A FLAT rock was all that Whipple 
** and Vandeever had to sleep on, 
there under the overhang. But they 
were men of hard fiber and used to the 
hardships of the hills. The chastened 
spirit of Johnson Blue seemed to fill 
the place. To Whipple this unseen 
presence was as a benediction ; nor was 
it as disturbing to Vandeever as he had 
fancied it might be, for when morning 
came he was sleeping so soundly that 
his friend had to shake him into wake- 
fulness. 

“See anything last night, W. J. ?" in- 
quired the cowboy, as he sat up and 
rubbed his eyes. 

“Not a thing." 

“Same here. Glory! I never reck- 
oned I'd sleep like that. Let's crawl 
out o' this hole in the wall and find the 
sun." 

A morning in Southern Arizona is 
one of the most cheering wonders of 
the country. The mounting sun has 
a glory all its own, and the air has a 
tonic warranted to put to flight all the 
blue devils that lurk in a human heart. 


Vandeever was in a more hopeful mood 
than on the preceding evening. 

“If we could get hold of a couple o' 
them six-guns," he remarked, while he 
and Whipple were dipping their heads 
in the creek, “we needn't ask no odds 
of anybody, W. J." 

Whipple shook the water out of his 
hair and dried his face on his handker- 
chief. “We'll play a waiting game, 
Charley," he said, “and see what turns 
up. They're busy getting breakfast 
over there at the cabin,” he added, his 
speculative gaze on the smoke that was 
rising from the chimney. 

“I could mow away a man's size share 
o' grub if I had the chance. Seems like 
LaDue might invite us in for the morn- 
ing's snack." 

“He won't do that; he's planning to 
keep us at a distance from the money 
and the guns, and will send breakfast 
out to us. There comes Sam Horna- 
day, now," Whipple added. 

“And he ain't totin' any chow," 
grumbled Vandeever disappointedly. 

Hornaday, however, was not coming 
in the direction of the two at the foot 
of the vine-clad cliff. He looked in 
their direction, grinned unpleasantly, 
and kept on toward the eastern wall. 
There he halted and yelled for Pecos. 
The latter looked out from the open- 
ing among the vines, answered the hail, 
and then threw down the rope ladder. 

“We could capture the ladder from 
them two if we had any kind o’ luck," 
Vandeever suggested. 

Whipple shook his head. While 
Pecos was descending the ladder, Horn- 
aday stood at the foot of it, on guard 
with a gun in each hand. 

“You're having a dream, Charley," 
said Whipple. “LaDue would be glad 
to have us try something like that. 
After the dust settled, there would be 
one amalgamator and one cow-puncher 
to keep Johnson Blue company on this 
flat. And what good would the ladder 
be to us if we had to use it and leave 
the money behind?" 

“I got to have action," Vandeever 
fretted. “Walkin' lame and jumpin' 
through the hoop at LaDue’s orders is 
a heap more than I can stand.” 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


39 


“Take it easy; there’ll be plenty of 
action when the right time conies.” 

Pecos, stepping from the rope ladder 
to the ground, did a brief round of 
sentry go while Hornaday climbed to 
the shelf and hoisted the trailing ropes; 
then Pecos made his way to the cabin. 
Everything, so far as LaDue’s clever- 
ness could devise it, had been made se- 
cure. 

Presently Simmons appeared at the 
cabin door carrying a basket. He struck 
out briskly across the flat, moving in the 
direction of Whipple and Vandeever. 
The latter, breathing hard, jumped to 
his feet. 

Whipple caught him and pulled him 
back. “Hang on to yourself, Charley,” 
he admonished. “You don’t want to 
spoil our breakfast, do you?” 

“I can’t begin to tell you how the 
sight o’ that traitor grinds me,” mut- 
tered Vandeever. “I’ll see that he gets 
his if it’s the last thing I ever do.” 

Simmons halted a few feet away and 
set down the basket, warily eying the 
cowboy as he did so. “Charley is get- 
ting me wrong,” he said, pitching his 
voice low. “I’m with you two, but I 
can be of more help by pretending to 
stand in with LaDue. That’s straight. 
Kick up some kind of a row so I can 
have an excuse to stand here and talk 
for a minute. LaDue is watching from 
the cabin, and Hornaday from the shelf. 
At the first suspicion that I’m not really 
throwing in with them, I’ll be as help- 
less as you two are — maybe worse off.” 

Whipple jumped to his feet and ad- 
vanced a step. “You’re worse than a 
sidewinder to turn us down like this!” 
he shouted, apparently in great anger. 

“All I want is a club!” roared Van- 
deever. 

Simmons jerked a revolver from his 
pocket; seemingly, he was holding the 
two wrathful men at bay. What he 
said, still in an undertone, was this: 

“LaDue, Hornaday, and Geohegan 
robbed the bank at Eudora, and they 
are hiding out here with sixty thousand 
dollars in cash and Liberty Bonds. 
They have fixed up this canon for a 
hang-out, and have some more robberies 
they are aiming to pull off. When they 


found us here it sort of spilled the beans. 
Go easy, you two. And be watchful. 
Bullets are apt to come your way at any 
time. I’m not done yet. Do something ; 
make it look as though there is bad 
blood between us and you are trying 
to ‘get’ me. I was told to shoot at 
the first sign of trouble.” 

Vandeever started to make a rush. 
Crack! went Simmons’ revolver. The 
bullet flew wide, but Vandeever clutched 
at his left arm and reeled back. 

“I’m to be on the shelf to-night, 
guarding the ladder,” Simmons went on, 
speaking hurriedly. “It’s our chance 
to do something. I’ll come down around 
midnight, and we’ll see what we can 
do at the cabin. It will be desperate, 
though; make up your minds to that.” 

Simmons whirled on his heel and 
started back across the flat, turning 
again and again to flourish the revolver 
and shout wild threats. 

“I reckon that play looked like the 
real thing,” said Vandeever; “and I’m 
sure surprised at that Sim! At that, 
mebby he’s only stringin’ us along.” 

“Give him the benefit of the doubt, 
Charley,” urged Whipple. “He’ll prove 
to your satisfaction whether or not we 
can rely on him — to-night.” 

“It don’t seem right sensible that La- 
Due would send him here with that 
grub, unless there was some kind of 
a hen on,” mused the cowboy darkly. 

He was rolling up his sleeve and bind- 
ing a handkerchief about his arm, a red 
silk handkerchief with which he had 
supplied himself in Phoenix. Having 
pretended to be wounded, it was im- 
portant to keep the deception alive. 
While eating breakfast, he did not use 
his left hand, but kept it tucked away 
between the buttons of his coat. 

The meal was a generous one, consist- 
ing of coffee, crackers, bacon, and fried 
potatoes. As the two friends ate, they 
considered this new turn of events. 

Three-card Monte, widely known as 
a crooked gambler, had blossomed into 
an out-and-out robber and holdup man. 
A safe retreat from the law was that 
hidden and inaccessible canon. How 
LaDue had found it was a mystery ; but, 
having found it, he was not slow to 


40 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


recognize its value from a lawless view- 
point. If pressed by officers of the law, 
he could come down his rope ladder; 
and, if the canon were found, he could 
pull down the ladder as a last resort. 
From that out-of-the-way spot he and 
his confederates could make their raids 
and then return to a rendezvous that 
was almost one-hundred-per-cent proof 
against discovery. 

Naturally, finding Whipple and his 
companions in the canon was a dis- 
agreeable surprise to LaDue. The un- 
pleasantness, however, was tempered by 
the seventy-five thousand dollars which 
Whipple had been forced to give up. 
For a little while, and because of Un- 
cle Wesley’s money> the gambler might 
bear with the castaways; but, in due 
course, as Whipple knew, Three-card 
Monte would tire of the trouble Whip- 
ple and Vandeever made him and would 
seek to eliminate them. Before this 
tragic move was deliberately attempted, 
the amalgamator and the cowboy would 
have to strike and strike hard, with 
Simmons’ help. 

“To-night is the time,” averred Whip- 
ple, “for we are taking grave chances if 
we wait longer than that.” Having fin- 
ished his breakfast, he lighted a pipe 
and arose to his feet. “Let’s go over 
to the bend and see if the wreck of 
the Ace High has anything to offer us 
in the way of a makeshift weapon. If 
we come to close quarters with the gang 
to-night, Charley, we ought to have 
something besides our fists to fight 
with.” 

“Good idee, W. J.,” assented Van- 
deever. 

As they started north along the creek, 
LaDue suddenly appeared from the 
cabin. He carried a rifle. “Where have 
you started for?” he shouted. 

“Jest takin’ a little amble to stretch 
our legs,” Vandeever answered, with a 
scowl. 

“Well, amble around the flat, but keep 
clear of the cabin. Try to leave the 
flat, Concho, and we’ll open up on you. 
That goes as it lays.” 

Vandeever hesitated, clenching his fist 
and grinding his teeth. “Fust time on 
record I ever took orders from a tin- 


horn !” he growled. “But I reckon there 
ain’t anything else to be done.” 

He turned and began following Whip- 
ple back toward the vine-clad cliff. 

“And here’s something else,” LaDue 
yelled. “You two have got to cut out the 
rough stuff when I send some one over 
with your meals. Simmons ought to 
have laid you out, Concho. Just for 
what you did this morning you men will 
get no dinner. If you prove to be 
peaceable, and obey orders about stay- 
ing on the flat, I’ll take some supper 
over to you myself.” 

Vandeever was furious, but he had 
sense enough to smother his feelings. 
Most certainly he and Whipple were 
under the thumb of this smooth, tricky 
card sharp; and, hard though it was, 
the situation would have to be borne 
for the present. 

The morning passed with another 
reading of Johnson Blue’s book, and the 
discussions to which the various philo- 
sophical gems gave rise. In view of 
the melancholy circumstances that pre- 
vailed in the canon, the last words of 
the wastrel castaway were more impres- 
sive than ever. 

Noon passed, and LaDue was as good 
as his word about withholding dinner. At 
one o’clock, Pecos relieved Silver as 
guardian of the ladder, and both ruf- 
fians, in going and coming, jeered the 
two hungry men as they passed them. 

“This is fierce, I’ll tell a man!” 
grunted Vandeever. “Hit me anywhere 
but where I live; I can stand anything 
but that.” 

“We ought to be able to miss a meal 
with good grace, Charley,” said Whip- 
ple. “Think what Blue had to put up 
with.” 

“Oh, I’ll stand it,” returned the cow- 
boy hastily, “but I’d like to eat a hun- 
dred dollars wuth o’ ham and eggs in 
front of Three-card LaDue, and him 
famishin* and laced to a post with a 
reata.” 

The afternoon dragged horribly. 
LaDue and Hornaday and Simmons 
played cards in the shade of the cabin, 
guns close at hand. They were care- 
ful to take up a position from which 
they could watch Whipple and Van- 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


41 


deever every minute. As the sun 
dropped low over the rim of the canon, 
the card playing ceased, and Hornaday 
and Simmons went into the house to 
get supper. When LaDue was called 
by Hornaday to “Come in an’ eat,” he 
stood up and looked in the direction of 
the amalgamator and the cowboy. 

“I’ve changed my mind, Conho,” he 
called. “You and your pard stood it so 
well without dinner that I'm going to 
hold back ypur supper.” 

Vandeever gave an ugly laugh as 
LaDue vanished inside the cabin. “Even 
a smooth tinhorn like him can play the 
fool now and then, W. J.,” he remarked 
to his friend. “The worst fighter I ever 
seen was a guy just hungry enough to 
be mad and not starved sufficient to be 
any ways weak. Because of losin' them 
two meals, I’d walk in on the hull gang 
this minute, alone and with my bare 
hands. It’s going to be some fight when 
we pull it off.” 

CHAPTER XIV. 

TURNING THE TABLES. 

CIMMONS had played well a very 
^ difficult role. It was no easy ma- 
neuver to deceive Three-card Monte 
LaDue, and yet this is precisely what 
Simmons had done. The gambler was 
convinced that the aviator was faithful 
to him and his lawless, plottings, and 
believed fully that no love was lost be- 
tween the aviator and Whipple and Van- 
deever. So Simmons was trusted with 
the work of guarding the rope ladder. 

He relieved Pecos and went on duty 
while the sun was still flashing brightly 
on the vine-clad wall ; but he had not 
been fifteen minutes on the shelf be- 
fore LaDue and Hornaday ran swiftly 
across the flat and took up their posi- 
tions at the foot of the cliff. 

“Hey, Simmons !” shouted LaDue. 
“What are you doing with two extra 
six-guns? You’ve got a brace of re- 
volvers more than you need or are en- 
titled to. Drop them into the blanket.” 

As he finished speaking,* he and Hor- 
naday stretched a blanket between them 
and waited for the weapons to be 
thrown into it. But they waited in vain. 


Whipple and Vandeever guessed what 
had happened. In his zeal to help them, 
Simmons had appropriated the extra 
revolvers and taken them with him when 
he climbed to the shelf. He was not 
minded to give them up and so yield an 
advantage gained by his cleverness. Be- 
sides, Ladue's faith in him was shaken, 
and temporizing with a man like this 
gambler when he was in such a state 
of mind would have been suicidal. Sim- 
mons kept well back on the shelf and 
hung on to the guns. 

Hornaday lost patience and swore 
heartily. LaDue had better command 
of himself. 

“Put over the ladder, Percy, and come 
down,” requested the gambler, his tone 
and manner not at all suggestive of the 
emotions that filled him. 

Simmons, however, was too knowing 
to let down the ladder and descend and 
place himself at the mercy of Three- 
card Monte. 

“Come down!” the gambler ordered 
at last, dropping his mask of friendli- 
ness and proceeding to threats. “I'll 
give you two minutes, and if you're 
not down by that time Silver and I will 
riddle the face of the cliff with bul- 
lets.” 

No word or sign came from Sim- 
mons ; then, promptly when the two min- 
utes were up, a merry fusillade stirred 
wild echoes in the canon. Pecos, a cup 
of coffee in one hand and a sour-dough 
biscuit in the other, came to a corner of 
the cabin to watch the excitement. 

Whipple was not slow to see that 
a situation had developed which, if 
quickly and properly used, would be 
highly advantageous to himself and 
Vandeever. 

“Charley,” he whispered, “while 
LaDue and Hornaday are busy with 
Simmons, and while Geohegan is giving 
all his attention to that side of the 
canon, no one seems to take any interest 
in you and me. Come on! We'll de- 
tour to the west and reach the cabin 
door while Geohegan is facing the other 
way.” 

“That scheme is a lulu, W. J. !” mut- 
tered the cowboy, with enthusiasm. 


42 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


A quick run to the left brought the 
two around the western side of the 
cabin. Whipple was almost at the open 
door when Pecos awoke to what was 
going on behind him. The coffee cup 
went one way and what was left of 
the biscuit went another. 

“No; y’u don’t !” he roared, dashing 
for the open door and juggling with a 
revolver as he came on. “Back up, or 
I’ll drop y’u where y’u stand !” 

Whipple shifted his line of advance, 
and instead of entering the cabin he 
plunged straight at Pecos. The latter 
halted, planted himself firmly and lifted 
the revolver. Whipple was desperate, 
and Geohegan equally determined. A 
distant report shattered the still air, 
breaking a lull in the target practice of 
LaDue and Hornaday. Geohegan gave 
vent to a hoarse yell of pain, and the 
revolver fell from his fist. 

“Score one for Sim !” shouted Van- 
deever jubilantly. “That was as neat 
a bit of drop firin’ as I ever seen.” 

Simmons had come into action, and 
at the very instant his services could 
best serve his friends. Whipple reached 
Geohegan’s side at a jump, and in a 
flash had gathered up the fallen weapon. 

“Into the cabin with you !” he or- 
dered, prodding Pecos with the muzzle 
of the gun. 

“Monte !” yelled Pecos, as he gripped 
his injured right arm with his left hand ; 
“Sam! Thar’s trouble at the ca ” 

Whipple gave Pecos a push that sent 
him through the open door headlong. 

“I’ve got him, W. J. !” cried Van- 
deever, from inside the cabin. “Get in 
here, quick ! Once the door is closed 
we can hold this shack ag’inst all com- 
ers.” 

That move, however, effective though 
it might be, was not for Whipple. 
LaDue and Hornaday had lost all in- 
terest in Simmons, for the moment, and 
were racing back toward the cabin. A 
revolver cracked, and a bullet buzzed 
angrily past Whipple’s cheek. He found 
himself looking into the gambler’s cool, 
murderous eyes. 

“I told you what to expect if you cut 
any capers,” snapped LaDue, “and now 
here’s where you get yours.” 


His first shot had missed because he 
was in too much of a hurry. Now he 
was more deliberate, and laughed jeer- 
ingly when Whipple, flexing his finger, 
brought down the hammer of 
Geohegan’s gun on an empty shell. 
LaDue, no doubt, felt that he could 
afford to take his time and make sure. 
Whipple was nearer the Great Divide, 
at that moment, than Uncle Wes 
had ever been in his life. But 
LaDue wasted three seconds ; and, while 
his weapon hung fire, a cabin window 
on his left crashed outward and, in the 
midst of the flying glass came Vandeever 
over the sill, falling on the gambler and 
bearing him down. 

“That’s the best ever, Charley!” ex- 
claimed Whipple, and immediately gave 
his full attention to Hornaday. 

LaDue selected his lawless aids with 
care and discrimination, and Geohegan 
and Hornaday were the pick of those 
men who regarded the law lightly and 
were of proved ability and courage. The 
tide was setting against LaDue, but 
Hornaday ran true to his traditions and, 
while possibly dismayed, he was ready 
for a last-ditch fight. Flinging himself 
down behind a small heap of firewood 
a few yards from the corner of the 
cabin, he began taking pot shots at 
Whipple from cover. 

Indian fashion, Whipple took to a 
tree ; thus screened, he “broke” the 
weapon that had failed him in the con- 
test with LaDue and examined the shells 
in the cylinder. All were empty and 
useless — a piece of carelessness on 
Geohegan’s part which, in other circum- 
stances, would have won a rebuke from 
LaDue. 

Vandeever had dragged LaDue into 
the cabin; and there, judging by the 
sounds that came through the open door, 
he was fairly busy. With a useless gun, 
and no cartridges at hand with which 
to replenish the cylinder, Whipple was 
at an impasse. Hornaday, watching 
weasel-eyed, was waiting for him to 
show enough of himself to make a tar- 
get worth while. 

This blockade was lifted by Sim- 
mons, as unexpectedly as Vandeever had 
crashed through the window and inter- 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 43 


fered with LaDue. Watching from the 
shelf in the gathering half gloom, the 
aviator had realized how badly he was 
needed by his friends; so he had low- 
ered the ladder, crossed the flat, and 
come up noiselessly on Hornaday’s side 
of the woodpile. The first Whipple 
knew of this was by a startled yell from 
Hornaday. The yell was followed by 
sounds of a furious struggle, and Whip- 
ple left the oak tree and ran swiftly to 
give Simmons a hand. From that point 
on the struggle was as brief as it was 
decisive. 

When Hornaday, at the revolver’s 
point, was marched into the cabin, La- 
Due was discovered flat on his back on 
the floor, Vandeever’s two knees on his 
chest, one hand compressing his throat, 
and the other hand, gripping LaDue’s 
revolver, threatening and holding 
Geohegan at bay. A little work on the 
part of Whipple and Simmons made 
the victory complete. 

Ropes were found, and the gambler 
and his confederates were firmly lashed 
and rendered helpless. Geohegan’s 
hands w r ere left free, because of his 
wounded arm, but his feet were bound, 
and it was clear that he had lost all 
relish for further combat. 

‘That was short and snappy, I’ll tell 
a man!” Vandeever exulted. “About 
twice as short and snappy, Three;-card, 
as if you had treated me and W. J. 
white and given us our grub. If you 
want to make a reg’lar panther out of 
a man, jest give him a touch o’ famine. 
Didn’t that never occur to you?” 

“If you fellows want your seventy- 
five thousand dollars,” said LaDue, 
“take it and get out of here.” 

“We want more than that, LaDue,” 
spoke up Whipple. “There’s the loot 
from the Eudora bank. You don’t think 
for a minute that we’ll leave that be- 
hind ?” 

The gambler scowled. “Simmons told 
you about that, I reckon. And Concho 
wasn’t nicked at all, this morning?” 

Vandeever laughed as he held up both 
hands. “That was jest a possum play, 
LaDue,” he answered. “How does it 
feel, havin’ the boot on t’other leg? 
Sim,” he added turning and giving his 


hand to the aviator, “you are the clear 
quill.” 

“Thank Johnson Blue for that,” said 
Simmons humbly, as he shook the cow- 
boy’s hand; “the writings in that little 
book have given me a brand-new out- 
look upon life. I’m glad we fell into 
this canon.” 

“Same here,” supplemented Van- 
deever. His glance roved reflectively 
over the supper table, and the remains 
of the meal left by LaDue and his men. 
“You strike a light, W. J.,” he went 
on, “and I’ll stir up the fire and rustle 
some hot chow. Honest, I was never 
so hungry in all my born days. Poor 
old Blue! For half a day we’ve been 
under his pack o’ trouble here in star- 
vation Gulch. It brought us right close 
to him, don’t you think?” 

CHAPTER XV. 

THE LAST ORDEAL. 

T'HE supplies in the cabin were raided 
* for a bountiful meal, and it was 
served piping hot. When Vandeever at 
last pushed back from the table and 
lighted a cigarette, he was in a genial 
and happy mood. 

“There’s a satchel under that east 
bunk, Whipple,” remarked Simmons, 
“and you will find your money and the 
bank loot inside. LaDue was cashier 
and took charge of all the boodle.” 

Whipple found the small satchel, 
cleared a space on the table, and began 
checking over the contents of the 
satchel. All his thousand-dollar bills 
were, of course, intact; in addition to 
these, he found twenty thousand dollars 
in bank notes of twenty, fifty, and one- 
hundred-dollar denominations, all 
banded in packets. Also, there were 
Liberty Bonds to the amount of forty 
thousand dollars more. 

“This is fine!” exclaimed Whipple 
happily. “Now I can give my uncle’s 
money — the most of it — back to him, 
and we can turn over the stolen loot 
to the bank.” 

“You’re a pinhead, Whipple, if you 
do anything like that,” spoke up LaDue. 
“Why don’t you three men divide it up 
among you and take a trip abroad?” 


44 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


Whipple laughed, Vandeever glared, 
and Simmons looked uncomfortable. 

“What you need, you thievin’ tin- 
horn,” said Vandeever, “is a course of 
study in Johnson Blue’s book. Forty 
a month and found is all I’m lookin’ 
for’ard to; and I’ll tell a man that the 
prospect is more pleasin’ to me than 
ever it was in my old careless days. 
Funny how a batch of writin’s like 
Blue’s gets under a feller’s hide, ain’t 
it? ” 

Whipple, Vandeever, and Simmons 
passed their last night in the canon 
cabin. While two of them slept, one 
was always on guard. The prisoners 
were resourceful and desperate men, 
and no chances were to be taken with 
them. Next morning there was an early 
breakfast, and the three friends made 
their preparations for leaving the cabin 
and getting out of the hills. 

Three canteens were filled with cool, 
clear water from the creek, and three 
packs of supplies were made ready. 
Three revolvers belonging to LaDue and 
his partners were appropriated, and 
their cylinders replenished with fresh 
ammunition. 

Whipple had tried hard to learn some- 
thing about the situation of the canon, 
the route to be followed in getting back 
to Phoenix, and the method by which 
LaDue and those with him had reached 
that part of the rough country. The 
gambler had nothing to tell him, and 
neither had Hornaday nor Geohegan. 

“You’ll never make it on foot,” La- 
Due had said ; “your grub and water 
will be gone before you are halfway out. 
A stray prospector may find your bones, 
some time in the future, but even that 
is a hundred-to-one bet.” 

“Then,” returned Whipple coolly, “it 
will be as hard on you as it is on us; 
for when we leave here, LaDue, we’ll 
haul up the rope ladder. If we get out, 
we’ll send a sheriff and posse back after 
you. That’s better, isn’t it, than starv- 
ing to death in this canon?” 

A gloomy expression crossed the faces 
of Hornaday and Geohegan, but the 
gambler seemed utterly unmoved. 

“Not according to my way of think- 
ing,” said LaDue. 


All the firearms in the cabin were 
carried away by Whipple and his 
friends. Geohegan was left with his 
hands free, and it would be only a short 
time before he released LaDue and Hor- 
naday of their bonds. Carrying off the 
guns was to prevent further trouble 
while the homeward-bound party 
climbed to the rim rock and set out on 
the eastern trail. 

Whipple, who was the last man to 
reach the shelf, found himself on a 
broad, smooth ledge which had a down- 
ward pitch to the place where it joined 
the cliff. Simmons explained how easy 
it had been to keep clear of bullets 
launched from the flat merely by hug- 
ging the rear wall. 

“And there’s the way up,” he finished, 
indicating the lip of a fissure that angled 
steeply toward the top of the wall, back 
of the swinging vines. “I had a mind 
to explore that, only LaDue didn’t give 
me time.” 

The rope ladder was drawn up and 
piled on the shelf, and all the extra fire- 
arms were laid beside it; then, Whip- 
ple leading, the climb for the top was 
begun. Steady nerves were demanded 
for this, and the amalgamator was glad 
that the festooned vines hid from his 
eyes the dizzy depths of the canon. In 
due course he came out on the crest of 
the bank, and paused to let his gaze 
rove over the flat. 

All the prisoners were free of their 
ropes and standing in a forlorn group 
by the cabin, their faces no more than 
white patches against the greenery be- 
low. Hornaday and Geohegan shook 
their fists; LaDue coolly lighted a cig- 
arette. 

Whipple’s gaze moved toward the 
left, where a sandy mound lifted itself 
among the trees. All that was mortal 
of Johnson Blue was there — a mis- 
guided man who found wisdom in the 
spot where death overtook him. 

“Kind o’ rough on Blue,” remarked 
Vandeever, halting at Whipple’s side, 
“leavin’ him with that bunch of tough 
customers. You got his book, W. J. ? 
And his eighteen cents?” 

“I have, Charley,” replied Whipple, 
“and let us hope that the spirit of his 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


45 


last writings will be with us and nerve 
us for our fight in getting out of these 
hills.” 

He turned to look eastward. It was 
a discouraging vista, for all that could 
be seen in that direction was peak after 
peak. Whipple descended an easy slope 
on his way to a seam that opened be- 
tween two of the hills. He stopped 
suddenly, his eyes on the sand in front 
of him. 

“One secret is out, anyway!” he ex- 
claimed. “LaDue got here in an auto- 
mobile. Here's where the machine 
stopped to let him and his two partners 
off; and there's where it turned to take 
the back track.” A note of cheer crept 
into his voice. If an automobile could 
get here,” he went on, “I don't see how 
we’re going to run into any very hard 
traveling. All we've got to do is to 
follow the tracks.” 

The tracks were easily traced, and 
led into the seam, wound tortuously 
about the bases of the hills, and then 
climbed a ridge and descended into a 
wide, shallow valley. 

The sun was mounting toward the 
zenith, a brazen, fiery shield whose rays 
grew hotter as the day wore on. Heat 
waves, rising from the baked earth, 
quivered in the furnacelike air. Clumps 
of cholla cactus and greasewood danced 
grotesquely when viewed through the 
wavering, transparent veil. Simmons 
was first to give out. He staggered to 
his knees with a groan. 

“I'm no good at this kind of travel,” 
he complained. “This pack on my 
shoulders weighs a ton.” 

For the dozenth time he uncapped his 
canteen and put it to his lips. Van- 
deever snatched it away from him. 

“You're waterlogged, Sim,” said the 
cowboy. “We got to be careful o' the 
stuff in the canteens. And, anyways, 
you could drink like a fish and it 
wouldn’t help none. Get up and try 
ag'in; I’ll help you.” 

With Vandeever on one side and 
Whipple on the other, lending him their 
support, the aviator reeled on. Over 
his head the amalgamator and the cow- 
boy exchanged significant glances. Sim- 


mons was not toughened to the deserts, 
as they were, and they realized that he 
was going to be a tremendous handicap. 
But he had played a man’s part in the 
canon. Whipple's face set hard, and 
Vandeever’s lips tightened. What one 
thought was at that moment in the mind 
of the other: They would all win clear 
of those scorched, waterless hills, or 
they would all stay in them to the end 
of time. 

When Simmons' feet refused to move 
another step, Whipple found a great, 
bare pinnacle of rock, and in its shadow 
all three sat down for a rest. They 
ate some of their food, washing it down 
with a few sips from the canteens. 
When the time came for them to start 
on again, Whipple and Vandeever 
scanned the sky with ominous eyes and 
decided to remain where they were. 

The hilltops to the north were blurred 
with a haze of ghastly yellow. The haze 
thickened into an opaque curtain and 
drew onward with a rush. A puff of 
wind, blistering hot, stirred the sand of 
the valley until the ground seemed to 
be smoking. 

“Here's an elegant row of stumps, 
W. J.,” growled Vandeever; “a thing 
like this couldn't happen only right now, 
could it?” 

“What's the matter?” queried Sim- 
mons. 

“Sand storm,” answered Whipple 
briefly. “Hug the lee of that rock, 
Simmons; and pull off your coat and 
have it ready to put over your head.” 

They all knelt and pushed close to 
the rock pinnacle. The flying sand whis- 
pered against its worn sides; then, as 
the wind increased in fury, gusty blasts 
eddied around the huge bowlder and 
drove the sand stingingly against their 
faces. The yellow fog was all around 
them, and the smothering heat made 
breathing almost impossible. With 
heads muffled in their coats they gasped 
and choked and almost stifled. 

The physical torment brought by the 
storm gave the impression that it was 
hours in passing, but its duration could 
have been measured in minutes. After 
reaching its height it breathed itself out, 
leaving three mounds of sand from 


46 TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


which the travelers extricated them- 
selves. 

“That was shorter than usual, W. J.,” 
remarked Vandeever, shaking the sand 
out of his sleeves and wiping it from 
his grimy face. 

“The worst thing it did to us was 
to blot out the tracks of that automo- 
bile, said Whipple; “now we’ve got 
to head east, and go it blind.” 

When their packs were disinterred, 
it was discovered that Simmons’ can- 
teen was missing. He could remember 
nothing, about it. All three spent an 
hour kicking around in the loose sand, 
and were compelled at last to give up 
the search. 

Losing the canteen was a calamity, but 
nothing was said by Whipple or Van- 
deever to make Simmons feel worse 
about his carelessness than he did. They 
struggled on down that interminable 
valley, their only blessing the lessening 
heat of the sun as it dropped toward 
its setting. 

Another halt was made at sundown. 
The aviator, by that time, was in a 
sorry state. His eyes were puffed, his 
tongue and lips were swollen, and the 
last particle of energy had been sapped 
from his body. But there was a grow- 
ing coolness in the air that was most 
refreshing, and Simmons slumped to 
the ground, closed his eyes and slept. 
Whipple aroused him, after a while, 
and gave him his rations from the 
packs. He ate, gulped down the little 
water he was allowed to have, then went 
to sleep again. An hour later his two 
companions got him to his feet once 
more, and they continued their weary 
plodding onward under the brilliant 
Arizona night sky. Whipple conned 
their course by the stars and pressed 
the pace. 

There was now a very decided chill 
in the air which would have been most 
uncomfortable had the three travelers 
not been constantly moving. Simmons 
bore up better than he had done during 
the day, but his strength was flagging 
even while Whipple and Vandeever 
were going at their best. 

“I’m no good at this,” he panted ; 
“you fellows go on and leave me here. 


When you get out, send somebody back 
to pick me up.” 

“Not on your tintype, Sim!” returned 
the cowboy with emphasis. “We all go 
or we all stay, and that’s flat. Buck 
up! We can make five miles at night 
a heap easier than we can do one by 
day. Here, we’ll help you.” 

Whipple and Vandeever took turns 
carrying Simmons’ pack and helping to 
support him. They managed to keep 
him on his feet until after midnight, 
and then found further attempts use- 
less. Dropping to the ground on the 
very spot where Simmons gave out, all 
of them slept, dog weary and worn to 
the point of exhaustion. 

They awoke with the blazing sun 
once more in their eyes, and the blis- 
tering heat growing as the sun mounted 
toward the higher heavens. Then be- 
gan such a struggle as neither Whipple 
nor Vandeever had ever known in all 
their Arizona years. 

Simmons grew light-headed and be- 
came hard to manage. He fought to 
get hold of the canteens and the few 
drops of water that remained in them; 
he discarded his pack ; he sat down 
obstinately and refused to move; in 
short, he did everything his irrational 
mind suggested to delay the journey. 

The amalgamator and the cowboy 
grappled with him, dragged him, car- 
ried him, their one consuming desire 
to get onward at any cost. Simmons be- 
gan to see visions of flowing water and 
green trees. He babbled about them, 
and tried to crawl to the shelter of the 
groves and reach the streams. 

Vandeever, sprawled in the hot sand, 
gave vent to a croaking laugh. He 
reached out gropingly with his hands. 
“Where’s my canteen, W. J.?” he asked 
faintly. 

“Right in front of you there!” ex- 
claimed the startled Whipple. “Can’t 
you see it, Charley?” 

“See nothin’; I’ve been sun blind for 
an hour. Poor old Blue never went 
through anything like this, old-timer; 
he had Lost Creek with him all the 
way. Jest uncap one o’ the canteens, 
will you, W. J.?” 

Whipple uncapped both canteens.

One was dry and in the other there re- 
mained no more than a swallow of 
water. He pressed the canteen to Van- 
deever’s lips. 

“Now you better take a swig,” sug- 
gested Vandeever. 

“Sure,” said Whipple, and tossed the 
canteen away. 

Once more Vandeever laughed. 
“Ain’t we the gay spenders for you?” 
he croaked. “A hundred and thirty- 
five thousand dollars in our jeans — and 
we couldn’t buy a glass o’ water with 
it. All gone, you old seed; you can’t 
fool me. Made me take the last drop, 
didn’t you? Well, that’s about like you 
is all I can say, W. J. !” 

There was no answer. With an ef- 
fort, Vandeever got to his knees and 
crawled over the hot sand, groping with 
his hands. He found what he was 
hunting for, at last: a still form, crum- 
pled and motionless. He felt the face, 
and with his hand he patted one of 
the shoulders. 

“Best pard a man ever had !” he mut- 
tered. “If here’s where we take the 
Long Trail, W. J., I couldn’t ask for 
no better company.” 

CHAPTER XVI. 

HARD TO BELIEVE. 

Y^hipple rode back to conscious- 
ness on a sea of troubled dreams ; 
and a voice, which had an oddly familiar 
sound, caused him to sit up quickly and 
take notice. 

It was night, one of those splendid 
nights for which the desert country is 
noted. The stars were so big and 
bright that it seemed as though one had 
only to reach out a hand in order to 
get hold of Orion’s Belt, or of the Big 
or Little Bear. There was a lush smell 
of standing water, and Whipple low- 
ered his eyes and saw a good-sized 
water hole, surrounded by a dusky chap- 
arral of mesquite. How the moonbeams 
played and danced over that stretch of 
water ! In the nearer distance was a 
glowing camp fire. A very tall man in 
sharp silhouette was jerking a bag from 
the teeth of a scrawny, crop-eared burro. 
Tossing the bag on a heap of camp 


plunder, the man hauled the burro away 
on a picket rope. 

“I’ll picket you where you won’t be 
so handy to the grub, Handsome,” said 
the boss of the camp, and he and the 
burro lost themselves temporarily in the 
chaparral shadows. 

Whipple’s wandering glances took in 
his closer vicinity. Vandeever lay on 
one side of him, his eyes bandaged with 
a white cloth. On the other side lay 
Simmons. 

“Hey, Charley!” called Whipple 
softly. 

“On deck, sport,” answered the cow- 
boy promptly. “How you stackin’ up?” 

“All right. Feel so comfortable I’ve 
a notion I’ve been watered and fed.” 

“Plumb comfortable myself, except 
my eyes. The old geezer put somethin’ 
on ’em and tied ’em up; he says it’s a 
sure cure, and that I’ll be able to see 
things by sunrise.” 

Whipple turned to the aviator. “How 
are you, Sitnmons?” he queried. 

“Sort of hazy,” Simmons told him. 
“I’ve had a particularly bad dream and 
can’t remember a thing since the sand 
storm till I woke up here.” 

“This prospector must have found us 
and brought us to the water hole,” 
Whipple went on. 

“That’s what he done,” said Van- 
deever ; “he told me about that while 
he was bandagin’ my lamps. He allows 
we was all three purty badly done up 
when he happened upon us.” 

“Who is he? I’ve heard that voice 
of his before somewhere.” 

Here the tall man himself drew near 
and stood at Whipple’s side. “You’ve 
heard this bazoo of mine many a time, 
W. J.,” he put in. “Give me a good 
look, T>oy.” 

Whipple turned his head and stared. 
Then he rubSed his eyes and gave a 
gasp. “Uncle Wes?” he said incredu- 
lously. “Well, it can’t be Uncle Wes! 
Can it?” 

The tall man laughed. “It’s me, all 
right. That doctor you sent down from 
Prescott found out that my heart was 
as good as anybody’s, and that all I 
needed was exercise. Her prescription 
was to stir around and be active. That’s 


48 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


what I’ve been doin', W. J., ever since 
you sailed away in a flyin’ machine and 
dropped plumb off the earth. Pm not 
feelin' more than thirty years old, this 
minute. This spell of desert ramblin' 
has chirked me up wonderful. That 
lady doc— doctor — sure knows her busi- 
ness." 

For a minute or two Whipple was 
so overwhelmed that he lost the power 
of speech. At last he found his tongue. 

“Lady doctor!" he echoed. “Is that 
Doctor Mixinger a lady?" 

“In every sense o' the word, W. J.," 
declared Uncle Wes ; “and she's a right 
competent lady, if anybody wants to 
ask you. As soon as I found I had 
thirty years to live instead of only six 
months, of course my deal with you 
was off. I had to get back my money 
before you had spent it all. Believe 
me, I did stir around ! I figgered that 
every day I lost while lookin' for you 
cost me more than three thousand dol- 
lars. And I lost a lot of 'em, mainly 
because you and your party had climbed 
into the sky and nobody had any idee 
where you had come down. The guess 
was pretty general that you were all 
killed by an accident to your machine 
and were lyin' in the mountains some- 
where. Naturally, I wanted to beat the 
coyotes to my money. Three-card 
Monte LaDue had put up a job on you, 
W. J., and " 

“We know about that, Uncle Wes," 
cut in Whipple. 

“So Charley Vandeever was tellin’ 
me. Well, the sheriff and a posse 
started for Saddleback Flats," Uncle 
Wes continued ; “and Galusha Mingo 
and Katie and me, we got an automobile 
and followed ’em up, but " 

“Katie!" murmured Whipple. “Did 
she try to find me, too?" 

“I never saw a girl feel so bad over 
anything as she did over the way you 
disappeared. She and Galusha are still 
looking for you, but they are staying 
at Jimmie Haight's cabin in Apache 
Draw, and doin' their searchin' from 
there. You see, there was no sign of 
you at Saddleback Flats, and no sign 
of LaDue and his crowd; but we all 
had a notion you had been wrecked in 


the mountains, so we began to hunt, 
each in our different ways. I borrowed 
Jimmie Haight's burro, Handsome, and 
got a grub stake off of Jimmie, and put 
off into the hills on my own. The sher- 
iff and his bunch are usin' an automo- 
bile, and Galusha and daughter Katie 
are ridin' hossback. 

“Day before yesterday I hit some au- 
tomobile tracks. I could tell by the 
treads of the tires that them tracks 
wasn't made by the sheriff's machine, so 
I follered ’em straight into the heart of 
the rough country. I reckoned I was 
getting purty warm just when that 
blamed sand storm hit the hills and 
wiped out the automobile tracks. I 
made for this water hole, as soon as 
I dug Handsome and myself out of the 
drifted sand, and pitched camp here; 
then I strolled up that wide valley and 
fairly stumbled over you and your two 
pards. It looked for a spell as though 
you lay right where the flyin' machine 
had dropped you, and that about all that 
was left of you was ree-mains. But I 
was wrong, for all three of you were 
alive. Two swallows of water made 
Vandeever sit up and talk; then I began 
to get the hang o’ things. I was playin' 
in great luck, W. J., and you and your 
friends were doing the same." 

The suddenness with which his uncle 
had stepped out of the role of a con- 
firmed invalid, and spread himself over 
the country in active pursuit of what 
was left of his hundred thousand dol- 
lars, was a matter of consuming wonder 
to Whipple. Now that Uncle Wes had 
a long life ahead of him, nothing was 
more natural than that he should want 
his money back again. 

“I should say we were in luck!” de- 
clared Whipple. 

“You understand I've got a right to 
take back what's left of my money?” 

“Of course ! Why, Uncle Wes, I was 
planning to return it to you." 

“You're shy something like twenty- 
five thousand, W. J.," said the old tight- 
wad. “Are you willin’ to make it up 
to me ?" 

“You’re a nice kind of an uncle, you 
old skinflint !" yelped Vandeever. 
“After tellin’ W. J. to go out and spend 


DOLLARS ROMANTIC 


49 


the dinero, you're now crawfishin' on 
your own game. How can he give you 
back what he hasn't got ?" 

“There's an extry twenty thousand 
in cash in the satchel," remarked Uncle 
Wes, “and forty thousand in Liberty 
Bonds." 

“You can't have them, uncle," said 
Whipple; “they belong to the Eudora 
bank — LaDue's loot." 

“There's a reward of five thousand 
dollars out for capturin' the robbers," 
returned Uncle Wes cannily, “and ten 
per cent of all the loot recovered. That 
means eleven thousand cornin' to you. 
That would help some." 

“Part of the reward goes to Charley 
and Simmons," Whipple told his uncle, 
“but you can have my third of it." 

“Then there's somethin' else," pur- 
sued Uncle Wes. “You gave Muggy- 
one Mike Moloney fifty dollars, and the 
old hassayamper used it for a grubstake, 
drawin' up an agreement with you, 
signin' it and leavin' it with Felix Van- 
nell at the Fordham. And I'll be blessed 
if Muggyone didn't prance right out 
into the Phoenix Mountains and drop 
onto a true fissure that everybody has 
walked over for the last fifty years! 
The rock goes fifty dollars to the ton, 
and already Muggyone has been offered 
a big price for his find. Muggyone 
located that prospect, filed on it, and had 
the big offer to buy all in less'n ten 
days ! Fastest work on ree-cord ; and 
the only time in his hull rovin’ life that 
Muggyone ever had any luck. It hasn't 
run much in his line." 

“You three go ahead and sleep," Un- 
cle Wes continued; “I'm goin' to sit 
up and keep the fire blazin' bright. The 
sheriff and his posse are trailin' around 
in this part of the hills, and I'm tryin' 
to signal 'em. I'm readin' a right in- 
terestin' book you had in the satchel 
with all that money — the last writings 
of Johnson Blue." 

“Go ahead and read it," urged Van- 
deever, as he fell back on the sand and 
turned over on his side; “if you wasn't 
such an iron-clad old hiderack, mebby 
them words of Blue's would get under 
your skin and do some good. But it

won't do no harm to give 'em a chance, 
anyways." 

CHAPTER XVII. 

AN UNRECORDED ANSWER. 

IT is all a part of history now — the 
1 sudden and meteoric rise of one 
Wesley J. Whipple, who rode into 
Phoenix one spring day scattering bal- 
lads all along the trail from the Three- 
ply Mine to town. His story, as one 
gleans it from the papers, reads like 
a tale from “The Thousand and One 
Nights." 

First, there was Uncle Wesley Plun- 
kett McDougal, deceiving himself — 
with the help of Doc Flickinger — into 
believing he was already climbing the 
foothills of the Great Divide, and was 
to be over the summit in three months 
to a day, almost to an hour. Then came 
the queer proceeding whereby Uncle 
Wes, executing a right-about from his 
miserly habits, gave his nephew outright 
one hundred thousand dollars to spend 
and enjoy; and a few days later, in a 
spirit of rich comedy, the record tells 
of Doctor Mixinger, of Prescott, prov- 
ing to the old prospector, by stern meth- 
ods, that his heart was all right and that 
he still had thirty years to live. There 
were chuckles in Phoenix over that, and 
more chuckles over the way Old Plunks 
went into the hills hunting for his van- 
ished nephew and what remained of 
the hundred thousand. 

All Arizona knew, in due course, how 
Whipple and Vandeever and their hired 
aviator, Simmons, had been cast away 
in the mysterious Lost Creek Canon, 
and there had been found by LaDue, 
Hornaday, and Geohegan, fresh from 
Saddleback Flats where they had missed 
a gay scheme of plunder only to con- 
nect with it again in Blue’s pocket 
among the hills. How Whipple and his 
comrades had turned the tables on La- 
Due and his men, left them in the 
canon, and almost perished on their 
way out of the hills, were but parts of 
a story told over and over in store and 
dwelling, among the mines and on the 
cattle ranges. 

And the “kick" which fate had put 


50 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


into this particular angle of the affair 
was wrapped up in the fact that Mc- 
Dougal himself was the one who had 
found and rescued his nephew, Van- 
deever, and Simmons; not only getting 
back what remained of his money, but 
also — and this was the big, the marvel- 
ous thing as it turned out — finding the 
book of Johnson Blue and developing 
an absorbed interest in the wastrel's 
sound philosophy. 

The whole Southwest learned how the 
sheriff and posse in their flivver caught 
smoke signals from the camp at the 
water hole, made for it, and learned 
about the bank looters trapped and held 
in Lost Creek Canon. Vandeever, his 
sight restored, but with eyes protected 
by smoked glasses, furnished by Uncle 
Wes, piloted the law officers along the 
shallow valley, over the ridge, through 
the seam, and so to the canon. There 
the wily LaDue and his two roughneck 
confederates were captured with very 
little trouble, and landed behind the bars 
of the building in the courthouse plaza 
in Phoenix. After the courts had dealt 
with them, they were taken to another 
place of stone walls and bars for an 
extended stay. 

Bad news, however, was current re- 
garding Mogollon Mike Moloney and 
the fifty-dollar grubstake furnished by 
Whipple. Originally it had been be- 
stowed as a free gift to an old friend, 
but so “white” was Moloney in his in- 
tentions that, in secret, he drew up a 
grubstake agreement and deposited it 
with Felix Vanned in trust for Whip- 
ple. The mine was sold ultimately for 
fifty thousand dollars. Of this amount, 
however, Whipple received nothing, as 
Moloney lost the entire amount in set- 
tling gambling debts, which he incurred 
on the strength of his find. Whipple’s 
fifty dollars, cast as bread upon the 
waters, therefore never returned to him, 
and the incident could not be included 
among the dazzling romances of the 
mining country. But, as Whipple re- 
marked, he had expected nothing and 
therefore could not be disappointed. 

The bank reward went share and 
share alike to Whipple, Vandeever, and 
Simmons. And Vandeever and Sim- 


mons were not forgotten by Whipple ; 
for when the latter bought a ranch near 
Prescott, Charley Van had an interest 
in it and acted as foreman; and Sim- 
mons, who started wrong, but caught 
himself up through the writings of the 
late Johnson Blue, was also given a 
position. 

The right kind of prosperity dawned 
for everybody; and, seemingly, it had 
root in that little book of Johnson 
Blue’s. Strangest of all, perhaps, was 
the effect the book had on Wesley 
Plunkett McDougal. So fascinated was 
he with the weird record and its gems 
of wisdom, that he borrowed the book 
and kept it for two weeks. When he 
returned it to his nephew he was a 
changed man. As Doctor Alfred Mix- 
inger had undeceived him regarding his 
health, so Johnson Blue’s posthumous 
influence altered his whole conception 
of life. 

Uncle Wes wanted to return the sev- 
enty-five thousand dollars to Whipple, 
declaring that he had given it in good 
faith and should not take it back. But 
Whipple insisted that he had no right 
to the money, quoted Blue to support 
his argument, and refused flatly to ac- 
cept it. 

Although overruled on this point, Un- 
cle Wes was like the Rock of Gibraltar 
in refusing to let his nephew make up 
any of the amount he had spent. 

“I wasn’t to invest any of the hundred 
thousand, Uncle Wes,” argued Whipple, 
“but it seems that I did that unwittingly. 
If Charley and I hadn't bought the aero- 
plane we should not have been cast 
away in Lost Creek Canon and should 
not have been able to recover the bank’s 
money or get the reward for capturing 
LaDue and his two pals.” 

“I’m standing pat,” growled Uncle 
Wes obstinately. “Blue’s book is a les- 
son for tightwads as well as for spend- 
thrifts, and I’m taking my lesson to 
heart. From now on, by gorry, I’m 
going to pay taxes, and every cent I’ve 
got goes into taxable bonds. I owe 
that to a land that can produce a man 
like Johnson Blue. Hereafter, W. J., 
I’m going to live like a white man. Get 
me? I’ve got my health, and I’m going

after some of the brightness and hap- 
piness Doctor Mixinger mentioned. 
And there’s that Galusha Mingo invest- 
ment, my boy; and then, the rest of 
it. When’s the wedding? I'm going to 
buy a present for that affair that will 
cost a wad of money. When’s it to be?” 

Here was something else again. Un- 
cle Wes referred to an event that hap- 
pened when Whipple, coming out of 
the hills, stopped for a night at Jimmie 
Haight’s cabin in Apache Draw. Uncle 
Wes had to return the burro he had 
borrowed, a long-eared, camp-raiding 
pack animal who was called Handsome 
because he was so ugly. Galusha Mingo 
and Katie were there, it will be remem- 
bered, and hence Whipple was very 
anxious to stop. 

He was welcomed with open arms by 
Mingo, and with much happiness by 
Katie. To both of them he recited the 
adventures that had followed his at- 
tempt to get to Los Angeles by aeroplane 
so that, aided and abetted by Concho 
Charley Vandeever, he could spend 
largely and acquire most for his money. 

“What a blessing you were wrecked 
in a canon,” commented Galusha Mingo, 
“where you couldn’t spend a cent !” 

“No; you are wrong, Mr. Mingo,” 
corrected Whipple; “the blessing came 
to me in the form of a book written by 
the late Johnson Blue. But we’ll not 
discuss that.” 

He finished his recital, Katie listen- 
ing breathlessly. 

“All very good,” approved Galusha 
Mingo. “Capturing the robbers and re- 
covering the money has caused you to 
get ahead in spite of yourself. No 
doubt you have wondered about the 
ten thousand dollars which I pried out 
of you. Well, I’ll tell about that. Katie 
and I were worried to see you spending 
your money so foolishly, so we laid 
our plans to save some of it for you. 
With the money you let me have, W. J., 
I bought an option on Holdover’s big 
brick block. He was hard up and eager 
to sell, and my option called for a bar- 
gain and gave me thirty days for a 
turnover. 

“I didn’t need the thirty days,” he 
continued. “In just a week I disposed 


of the option for twenty thousand dol- 
lars, and I am holding the profit for 
you. It would be a start, you see. 

“I want you to know, W. J.,” added 
Mingo earnestly, “that I didn’t take that 
money for myself. It was a plot of 
Katie’s and mine to help you; and I 
had to draw on my psychology and pro- 
ceed by indirection in order to be of 
any assistance to you. Katie has wor- 
ried about that, and the false position 
in which she has apparently placed her- 
self.” 

“We’ll talk that over,” said W’hipple 
to Mingo. “Suppose we take a walk 
down the draw, Katie ?” he asked. 

They took their walk ; and by a spring 
under a cottonwood tree they sat down, 
and Katie began to speak of Mamie and 
Lorena. 

“I want to tell you about Mamie and 
Lorena, Katie,” Whipple interrupted. 
“If you will remember, I met those two 
girls at a party at your house. You in- 
troduced me to them. Whenever I came 
into town with a little money to spend, 
Mamie and Lorena were all for helping 
me get rid of it, while you were always 
asking me to put it in the bank — or pay 
my debts. 

“Well, you know, debts never both- 
ered me much. I was always for let- 
ting the other fellow worry. Too free 
and easy, you understand, but with not 
a desire to beat anybody out of what 
was his just due. I just couldn’t seem 
to get the hang of that. I wanted a lot, 
and thirty a week won’t go very far. 
Your constant talk of saving rather 
jarred on me, so I turned to Mamie 
and Lorena. There I made my big 
mistake. That night I plunged with 
you to the extent of fifteen dollars and 
forty cents, and you called me down 
— oh, very nicely ! — for doing it ; I felt 
as though all the fun had been taken 
out of the evening. But always, I want 
you to know, I had a thousand thoughts 
of Katie Mingo where I had one of 
Mamie or Lorena. That’s how I felt, 
deep down in my heart.” 

There was that in his eyes, at this 
moment, which brought a vivid flush to 
Katie’s cheeks. And when he took her 
hand she did not withdraw it. 


52 


TOP-NOTCH MAGAZINE 


“I was worried, over there in Lost 
Creek Canon, Katie,” Whipple went on. 
“You see, Johnson Blue, when he was a 
bookkeeper at a hundred a month, lost 
his heart to a girl named Ethel. That’s 
the only part of her name that appears 
in his book. Just ‘Ethel/ If I had the 
full name and address, I’d go personally 
to tell Ethel what happened to Johnson 
Blue. Well, when Blue got his million 
dollars from his uncle, and began hav- 
ing high jinks with it, it appears that 
Ethel reproved him for his spendthrift 
habits — just as you reproved me, I im- 
agine. And Blue felt annoyed, and went 
his own way, and finally found himself 
a prisoner in Lost Creek Canon, with 
only eighteen cents in his pocket and 
the girl whom he loved married to a 
better man. 

“That’s what worried me, there in 
the canon, Katie. What if you married 
a better man while I was reading John- 
son Blue and seeing the error of my 
ways and making a firm resolution to 
be different — if I ever got out of that 
pocket? What if ” 

“Wesley,” said Katie softly, “it wasn’t 
possible.” 

“What wasn’t possible?” demanded 
Whipple, a wild suspicion stabbing at 
his heart. 

“Why,” answered Katie, her eyes low- 


ered, “that I could marry a better man 
than — than you!” 

The wild suspicion that Katie might 
be pledged to another at once took 
wings. 

“And will you marry me, Katie?” 
asked Whipple. “I have prospects now ; 
and, thanks to Johnson Blue, I can be 
all that your father would have me. 
Katie, look up! Tell me if I am going 
to be the happiest man that ever lived ?” 

What Katie said it is not necessary 
to put down here ; for her answer stood 
revealed in that question of Uncle Wes- 
ley’s: “When’s the wedding?” Whip- 
ple, very joyfully, told him “when was” 
the wedding, and Uncle Wes shook his 
hand hard. 

“Katie’s the girl I had picked for 
you all along,” he averred. “She hasn’t 
been proud of Old Plunks in the past, 
I reckon, but that’s all going to be 
changed from now on. And some day,
