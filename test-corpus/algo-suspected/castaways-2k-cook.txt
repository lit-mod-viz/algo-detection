Castaways of the Year 2000 
William Wallace Gook


SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTERS PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED. 

The time-coupe which brought back to the year 1901 six of the twenty-one who 
had gone in it to the year 2000, having been destroyed by a bolt of lightning, fifteen of 
the number are marooned a century ahead of their own times. Meanwhile Dr. Kelpie, in¬ 
ventor of the coupe, has mysteriously disappeared, and Gig Lindley is arrested on the 
charge of having abducted him. The members of the “ Relief and Rescue Society for the 
Castaways of the Year 2000,” go to Dr. Kelpie’s residence on an urgent summons from 
his man Chester. Here they find the Man from To-morrow, who with the time-ball, an 
invention of the twenty-first century, says he has come back to transport the members 
of the society to their friends in the year 2000. Jasper Kinch, detective, insists on Tod 
Plunkett’s brother Jefferson accompanying them, and the five of them cover a century 
in ten minutes to find themselves sprawled on the floor, and the Man from To-morrow 
vanished. Then a door opens and none other than the missing Dr. Kelpie appears, 
“lama prisoner of the era 2000,” he tells them. “ You are all prisoners. There is 
treachery afoot and little hope for any of us.” 

It appears that the fifteen prisoners of the twenty-first century have taken pos¬ 
session of the government and are running things in their own way. In seeking to 
escape, Everson Lumley, author of “ The Possibilities of the Sub-Conscious Ego, be¬ 
comes separated from the others and is rescued by Kennedy, 18, who, in company with 
Horton, 7, are discoursing with him about the edict of the usurpers that vaporized 
foods shall be replaced by the old-fashioned masticated sort. Suddenly there is the 
thump of an air-ship alighting on the roof. At sight of one of the two arrivals, Lum¬ 
ley’s heart fails him as a wave of remembrance rolls over his brain like an icy flood. 


CHAPTER XII. 
BY PNEUMATIC TUBE. 

MISS TIBIJUL! 

Why, oh, why had he not 
fallen before the electric guns 
of the guards? Lumley asked himself. 
Why had he been spared to be brought 
face" to face with the daughter of Ken¬ 
nedy, 18? 

Lumley’s dismay at that moment 
was somewhat tempered by surprise. 
Following Miss Tibijul into the 

room was none other than Jefferson 
Plunkett! 

Lumley had become acquainted with 
Miss Tibijul on the occasion of his 
first visit to the year 2000. The busi¬ 
ness of courtship in those times had 
been almost entirely taken over by the 
fair sex, and Lumley was wooed by 
Miss Tibijul with a dogged persistency 
that well-nigh drove him distracted. 

Up to the last exciting moment of 
his previous sojourn in 2000 Lumley 
had been harassed by the unwelcome

attentions of Miss Tibijul. Strange 
that he should have forgotten her, even 
at the time when he had found himself 
under her father’s roof. 

Somehow, as Lumley looked at Jef¬ 
ferson Plunkett and made note of the 
kindly consideration with which the 
lady favored him, his fears began to 
wane. 

Plunkett seemed entirely disorgan¬ 
ized. There was a blank look in his 
face and an uncertain light in his eyes. 
Miss Tibijul took his hand and led him 
to a couch. 

“ Poor man,” she murmured com- 
miseratingly, “ you’re all unstrung, 
and no wonder. Do sit down and rest. 
You are perfectly safe here.” 

Plunkett turned upon her a vacant 
stare. He did not speak, but slowly 
lifted a hand and drew it across his 
forehead. Gently Miss Tibijul pushed 
him down on the soft cushions behind 
him. He submitted passively. 

“ Daughter,” cried Kennedy, 18, 
in consternation, “ what does this 
mean? We are already courting de¬ 
struction by harboring one of the es¬ 
caped hostages, and now, unless my 
eyes deceive me, you bring in another.” 

“ I saved him,” answered Miss Tibi¬ 
jul proudly and a bit defiantly. “ I was 
out for an afternoon fly in the Beetle, 
and I saw this poor gentleman below, 
a number of guards with electric guns 
pursuing him closely. I dropped down 
and took him aboard.” 

“ And the guards got the number of 
your air-ship, I presume? ” chided her 
father. “ A pretty situation, I must 
say, Hortense! The dictators will be 
after us, and so will our own people. 
But there’s no use arguing with a 
woman. Who is Ahis man? ” 

“ Jefferson Plunkett, father. You 
are mistaken about our danger being 
increased by what I have done. This 
gentleman is the brother of the chief 
dictator. In rescuing him this after¬ 
noon I have won for all of us here the 
gratitude of our worst enemy. We—” 

The lady’s words faded from her 
lips. She had been taking a survey of 

the room, and her eyes began to snap 
and sparkle behind the boxlike specta¬ 
cles that covered them. 

“Well, dear me!” she exclaimed, 
stepping forward with outstretched 
hand. “ Here is my old friend, Ever¬ 
son Lumley, back again from the other 
century. The times have changed for 
the worse, Mr. Lumley, since you hon¬ 
ored us with your first visit.” 

It was merely a friendly pressure 
which Miss Tibijul gave Lumley’s 
hand. He experienced a tremendous 
relief. After all, the lady had had only 
a passing fancy for him, and it was 
plain that the fancy had gone, never to 
return. Lumley’s heart expanded with 
hope. 

“I am glad to see you again. Miss 
Tibijul,” he said, “ and—” 

“ Miss Hortense Kennedy, 18,” 
the lady interrupted. “ Edict No. 
2612 by the dictator of customs 
changed every name in New York.” 

“ I wish to thank you, Miss—er—< 
Kennedy,” Lumley proceeded, “ for 
saving Mr. Jefferson Plunkett. We 
were all quite worried about him.” 

“ As soon as I took him aboard the 
Beetle he asked me to hurry to Forty- 
Second Street Station. What did he 
mean ? ” 

“ He is an incredulous person,” ex¬ 
plained Lumley, “ and refuses to be¬ 
lieve that he has been transported from 
i 9 oi to the following century.” 

“ I knew something was wrong with 
him,” declared Miss Kennedy. “ He 
needs the gentlest treatment, or the 
shock of full realization will unbalance 
his mind.” 

She went over and sat down on the 
couch beside Plunkett. 

“ Don’t you understand, Jefferson,” 
she cooed, “ that nearly a hundred 
years have passed since yesterday? ” 

Plunkett lifted his hands and felt 
wonderingly of the upthrust braids 
capped with the gaudy ribbons. Then 
suddenly he broke into a maundering 
laugh. 

“ What a funny dream! ” he ex¬ 
claimed. 

As Miss Kennedy drew back, im¬ 
pelled by some unpleasant inference 
drawn from the words, Plunkett arose 
and let his eyes wander about the room. 
The shadows had begun to fall, and 
Horton, 7, passed to a table and 
uncapped the tin of condensed light he 
had brought with him into the room. 
A sunny glow diffused itself about the 
place, and Plunkett rubbed his double 
chin thoughtfully. 

“ H-m,” he mused, “ can you beat 
it? Chased by guards with electric 
guns, picked up by something out of a 
comic supplement, carried off in an 
air- ship, brought down through the 
roof-door of a house, and now some 
one illuminates by opening a tin can! 
Ouch! This is getting so deuced seri¬ 
ous that it hurts. Wonder if I’m going 
dippy? Wish I could get an expert 
medical opinion.” 

Lumley, prompted by a generous in¬ 
stinct to reassure a distressed mind, 
came forward. 

“ Mr. Plunkett,” he asked, “ don’t 
you remember me ? Don’t you—” 

A wild bellow came from Plunkett. 

“ Know you ? ” he cried thickly. 
“ Don’t you think for a minute, by 
James, that I’ll ever let you slip out of 
my mind. You’re here 1 , and you’re 
alone; I guess that’s enough for me.” 

With that he bore down upon Lum¬ 
ley, his face black with anger and his 
fat fists clenched. Miss Kennedy 
screamed and wrung her hands. Hor¬ 
ton threw a chair in front of Plunkett, 
over which he tripped and went crash¬ 
ing to the floor. Kennedy seized Lum¬ 
ley by the arm. 

“ Come with me, Lumley,” he whis¬ 
pered excitedly. “ The man will kill 
you if I don’t get you out of the way.” 

Lumley regretted the circumstances 
while yielding to the force of them. 
Giving himself into Kennedy’s hands, 
he was conducted into a dark passage, 
and finally into a sleeping apartment. 
Here Kennedy pressed a button which 
opened electrically a can of light fixed 
in a wall-socket; and then he closed 
and secured the door. 


Greatly perturbed, he walked up and 
down the room, while Lumley dropped 
upon the bed and reclined there to 
await further developments. 

“ There is no peace, no happiness 
for any of us since those dictators have 
been promulgating their decrees,” said 
Kennedy finally, coming wearily to a 
halt and facing his guest. “ Nothing 
goes as it should; even the ordinary 
course of events continually develops 
one thing after another to keep a New 
Yorker of the period in a nervous con¬ 
dition. Everything is being changed, 
and changed for the worse.” 

Lumley had a soft heart, and. felt 
keenly for his friend. There was little 
that he could say, however, and so he 
held his peace. 

“ When you were here before, Lum¬ 
ley,” pursued Kennedy, “ muglugs did 
all the work for us. We had house 
muglugs, factory muglugs, air - ship 
muglugs, and so on, so that it was nec¬ 
essary for us simply to speak and our 
orders were obeyed by tireless autom¬ 
atons of steel. Now these drudges 
have been taken away from us, and 
we are obliged to work with our own 
hands. 

“ I, even I,” and his voice filled with 
bitterness, “ have my back yard filled 
with pig - iron, and am compelled to 
manufacture rain - plugs for the 
weather department. This manual 
labor is sapping the life out of me. 
Unless--there is a change very soon I 
shall pine away under my misfortunes. 
This latest edict from the food depart¬ 
ment caps a climax. I cannot offer you 
supper, Lumley, for there is not a par¬ 
ticle of vaporized food in the house; 
and I would not give you any if there 
were. To-morrow morning I shall try 
and have a breakfast according to the 
anchient culinary standards, but I can- 
mot promise you anything even pass¬ 
able. My chef, Brown, 206, has one 
of these cook-books the dictators have 
forced on us, and the mere reading of 
half a dozen recipes sent him into a 
swoon. So I have my doubts about 
that morning meal. 


“ Now, friend Lumley, there are a 
great many things I must talk with you 
about—and not the least Of these press¬ 
ing topics is this man Jefferson Plun¬ 
kett and his hostile attitude toward 
you—but I am in no condition this 
evening to discuss matters of impor¬ 
tance. To-morrow, if you please, we 
will consider your case in all its bear¬ 
ings. Meantime, let me urge you to 
get a good night’s rest. You are 
obliged to go supperless to bed, but the 
dictators are responsible for that.” 

He moved toward the door. 

“ Horton and I will take care of 
Plunkett,” he went on, “ but it will be 
just as well for you to lock the door 
after me.” 

“ Pm obliged to you, Mr. Kennedy,” 
said Lumley, " for your kindness to 
me. Before I try to rest, though, I’d 
like to pick up a few transmits about 
my scattered friends. I’m badly wor¬ 
ried, and—” 

“ The information regarding your 
friends is incomplete and unsatisfac¬ 
tory,” interrupted Kennedy. “ Prob¬ 
ably it will be to-morrow morning be¬ 
fore we can secure anything definite. 
Have courage and patience, Lumley. 
Those on our side won’t dare do any¬ 
thing desperate, and of course your 
friends have nothing to fear from the 
dictators. Good night, my friend.” 

Kennedy passed from the room, and 
Lumley locked the door behind him 
and went to bed. 

On his previous visit to those luxuri¬ 
ous times every household had mug- 
lugs for menials. Each guest had a 
dapper little muglug valet to serve him, 
and throughout the establishment there 
were steel servants to fetch and carry. 
Lumley was having the striking 
changes in the year 2000 brought home 
to him in a most telling manner, -and 
his mind dwelt upon the subject for an 
hour or two before he went to sleep. 

At last he dropped over the edge of 
consciousness and began swimming 
through a sea of dreams. Now he was 
confronting electric guns that belched 
their thunderbolts in his face, and now 


he was frantically pursuing the time- 
ball and the chain of a hundred links 
through frightful centuries. 

Again, he was tormented by the 
amazonian attentions of Miss Tibijul, 
otherwise Hortense Kennedy, or was 
strapped in the iron chair of the think- 
ograph, or was battling to the death 
with Jefferson Plunkett. The fight 
with Plunkett came along at the end 
of his dreaming. He had struck at the 
fat hardware salesman and missed; 
with a. taunting laugh, the salesman 
had let drive at him with conspicuous 
success. The blow landed with a crash, 
and Lumley’s ears were still ringing 
as he opened his eyes. 

He discovered that he was sitting up 
in bed with fists doubled. It was broad 
daylight, and he drew a long breath of 
relief as he realized that he had been 
the victim of a nightmare. Then, the 
next moment, he realized, too, that 
some one was pounding on his door. 

“ Lumley! Wake up, Lumley! ” 

It was the voice of Kennedy, and 
was fairly crackling with excitement. 

“What’s wanted?” inquired Lum¬ 
ley. 

“ Let me in—hurry! You’re in dan¬ 
ger, Lumley! ” 

Lumley rolled out of bed and made 
haste to open the door. Kennedy, very 
much out of breath, staggered across 
the threshold. His face was ominous, 
and Lumley’s heart sank. 

“ What has gone wrong, Kennedy ? ” 
he gasped. 

“ Jefferson Plunkett has been using 
the transmit,” panted Kennedy. “ Hor¬ 
ton showed him how to use the thought- 
waves, and Plunkett sent out word, 
broadcast over the city, that you were 
being harbored in my house. The man 
must be crazy! Get into your clothes, 
Lumley, as quickly as possible.” 

This last admonition was useless, for 
Lumley was already pawing wildly at 
his garments. Kennedy helped him. 

“ What am I to do? ” faltered Lum¬ 
ley. 

“ I haven’t been able to think of any¬ 
thing, as yet,” was the response. “ I’m 


hoping that some of the muglug army 
will get here before the guards, and 
that—” 

Kennedy paused. A thump on the 
roof announced the alighting of an air¬ 
ship. A moment more and the voice 
of Horton came piercingly from a dis¬ 
tance : 

“ The guards are here, Kennedy! 
The house is surrounded and a de¬ 
tachment has just landed on the roof¬ 
staging and captured Plunkett!” 

Just then Horton showed his wild 
face in the door. 

“ Better surrender, Lumley,” he ad¬ 
vised ; “ there’s really nothing else to 
be done.” 

, “ I’ll not surrender hints! ” flung back 
Kennedy. “ Come on, Lumley; don't 
stop to put on your shoes.” 

With a shoe in each hand Lumley 
bolted after his host. Out in the hall 
they could hear the scuffling footsteps 
of the guards, racing through the 
rooms in a furious search. 

“ This way,” whispered Kennedy, 
and made off along the passage. 

An exultant cry came from some¬ 
where in the rear. 

“ They see you! ” exclaimed Horton. 
“ You are mad, Kennedy, to try to—” 

The words were lost. Kennedy had 
rushed through a door, jerked Lumley 
after him, and then slammed the door 
and shot a bolt. 

“An idea!” murmured Kennedy. 
“ I can save you, Lumley, but we shall 
have to be quick.” 

“Save me?” echoed Lumley, in a 
panic. “How?” 

“ This is the pneumatic tube-room. 
From this point we send and receive 
packages from all over the city. 
Here!” 

He stepped to one side of the cham¬ 
ber. In the wall, some two feet from 
the floor, was a round opening closed 
with a metal disk. Above the disk was 
a transmit-knob. Just below the disk 
was a trestlework topped with a bed of 
small rollers. Upon the rollers lay a 
cylinder, six feet long by eighteen 
inches in diameter. 


The cylinder was pointed at each end 
and halved and hinged lengthwise so 
that the upper half opened like a lid. 
The long lid was thrown back and 
Lumley could see that the cylinder was 
empty. 

“ Get into it! ” instructed Kennedy 
sharply. 

“ Get—into it ? ” repeated Lumley, 
recoiling. 

“ Yes! It’s your only chance. Be 
quick! ” 

Lumley climbed to the staging and 
squeezed himself into the cylinder. 
There was plenty of room up and down 
but a tight fit across. Kennedy, mean¬ 
while, was striking the transmit-knob. 

“ Well ? ” came a voice. 

“ A hundred and thirty pounds of 
rain-plugs for the weather bureau,” 
called Kennedy. “ Rush order.” 

“ The way is clear. Load the rairv- 
plugs into'the tube.” 

Kennedy pulled a lever. The cir¬ 
cular disk vanished and revealed the 
maw of a black opening. With a 
smothered exclamation Lumley sat up 
in the steel shell. 

“ What are you going to do with 
me, Kennedy? ” he asked, tremulously. 

“ Send you to your friends by pneu¬ 
matic tube,” was the answer. 

“ But I’d rather not go to my friends 
in that way. I —” 

A rain of blows dashed against the 
closed door and a clamor of voices de¬ 
manded the surrender of Lumley. 
With a hollow groan Lumley fell back¬ 
ward and w-edged himself into the 
cylinder. 

Swiftly Kennedy closed the cover 
and clamped it down. An awful feel¬ 
ing of helplessness and peril took pos¬ 
session of Everson Lumley. What if 
the cylinder should get blocked in the 
tube? How long would the air inside 
the steel shell support life? Suppose 
that— 

But he gave over his direful sup¬ 
positions abruptly. The rollers were 
turning beneath the cylinder and he 
felt that he was moving forward into 
the hole in the wall. A roar of air in 

violent suction filled his ears. A second 
later his head was driven into the rear 
point of the cylinder as he started sud¬ 
denly and rushed at the weather bureau 
like a bullet from a gun. 


CHAPTER XIII. 
miles jernyngham, weather 

DICTATOR. 

Lumley was too dazed to note when 
or how the cylinder came to a pause. 
He was conscious of some one work¬ 
ing at the upper half of the shell and 
was presently blinking in a bright light 
as the lid was thrown back. He heard 
a yell of consternation and a patter of 
running feet; then an excited voice : 

“Mr. Jernyngham! Mr. Jernyng- 
ham! ” 

“Hush that clamor, Simpson, 5,” 
came a second voice, and one of author¬ 
ity. “ What’s the row, anyway? ” 

“ Come here, please, Mr. Jernyng¬ 
ham! There are no rain-plugs in that 
cylinder from Kennedy, 18.” 

Lumley heard a rumble of anger 
from Jernyngham and a movement in 
his direction. He sat up. Jernyng¬ 
ham and Simpson, 5, were close. Jer¬ 
nyngham recoiled and Simpson gave 
another yell and pressed fearfully back 
against the wall. 

“ Suffering cyclones! ” exclaimed Jer¬ 
nyngham, recovering himself. “ Ever¬ 
son Lumley, or I’m a Hottentot! ” 

“ Good morning, Miles,” said Lum¬ 
ley, cheerfully. “ I’ve just-had a nar¬ 
row escape. You see, the guards were 
after me and Kennedy had to load me 
into the cylinder and fire me through 
the tube. How are you? ” 

Miles Jernyngham embraced his un¬ 
expected guest with great ardor. 

“ We’ll remember Kennedy for 
that! ” he declared. " Confound that 
bloomer brigade, anyhow! There’s 
no rime or reason in the way they’re 
acting. But they’ll get enough of it 
before we’re done with them. Tickled 
to death to see you, old man! Come 
into the office and tell me all about it.” 


Lumley fished his shoes out of the 
cylinder and turned to follow the 
weather dictator out of the tube-room. 

“ Get a grip on yourself, Simpson,” 
laughed Jernyngham as he passed his 
assistant. “ I don't wonder that you 
were taken aback when you looked for 
rain-plugs and found my old friend, 
Everson Lumley. Sun’s hot in Syra¬ 
cuse and they want a few clouds. As 
soon as they shoot in a hundred dollars, 
push a couple of cloud-plugs into the 
Syracuse section.” 

“ Very well, sir,” answered Simp¬ 
son, slowly recovering his mental poise. 

The way from the tube-room to the 
office carried Lumley and the dictator 
through a large chamber in which three 
meek-looking men of the period were 
at work. 

A large map of the State of New 
York had been split into three sections 
and fastened to three blank walls. 
Every town, village, and crossroads 
was plainly marked, and the entire sur¬ 
face was gouged with holes. Some of 
these holes were empty. Others were 
filled with round-headed plugs of dif¬ 
ferent colors. 

On his way through the room Jer¬ 
nyngham paused and cast a critical eye 
over one of the sections. 

“ I guess you’d better pull out that 
Steuben County plug, Arnold, 31,” 
said he. “ We’ve already given them 
more rain than they’ve paid for. And 
I want you to be more careful with the 
gale-plugs, Arnold. Herkimer County 
didn’t whack-up for that last spell of 
fair weather, and I told you to switch 
in one gale-plug and you switched in 
two. I just heard that you unroofed 
three stores in Coldbrook and blew 
over a steeple in Fairfield. Be a little 
more careful or you’ll get your walk¬ 
ing-papers.” 

Jernyngham passed on into the office 
and closed the door after Lumley. 

“ It’s a great graft, Lumley, this 
weather business, grinned Jernyng¬ 
ham, in high good humor, as he mo¬ 
tioned his guest to a chair. 

“ H-m,” said Lumley, sitting down 

and beginning to get into his shoes, “ is 
it right, Miles, to make a graft of it? ” 

“Why not? Before we took hold 
the weather business was in the hands 
of a trust. We’ve driven out the 
trusts/ cornered the muglugs and set 
the people to work. We charge only 
half what the trust charged for 
weather, and everybody ought to be 
satisfied.” 

“ Glad to hear you have cut the 
prices, but driving out one trust and re¬ 
placing it with another isn’t just the 
thing, is it? And in the case of a pub¬ 
lic necessity, like the weather, shouldn’t 
the government have control ? ” 

“ That’s what it has,” grinned Jer- 
nyngham; “ we’re the government in 
the State of New York. But we won’t 
discuss this at present. I’m hungry 
and was just going to have breakfast. 
Join me, and we’ll talk as we eat. 
Simpson, 5 ! ” he shouted. 

Simpson appeared in the door of the 
chart-room. 

“ Double that breakfast order,” said 
Jernyngham. “ Two portions ham and 
eggs. By the way, Lumley, how do 
you like your eggs? ” 

. “ Turned over,” answered Lumley, 
brightening with pleasant anticipations. 

“ Remember that, Simpson, 5,” went 
on Jernyngham. “ Double up on the 
fried potatoes, the buttered toast and 
the coffee. Also lay covers for two, 
for I have,” and here he gave a droll 
wink, “ a hundred and thirty pounds of 
rain-plugs to breakfast with me.” 

Simpson smiled faintly and with¬ 
drew. Jernyngham lifted his feet to 
the top of his desk and tilted back com¬ 
fortably in his office-chair. 

“We kept track of you fairly well 
yesterday by means of the transmits,” 
said he, “ up to the time you vanished 
in Kennedy’s back yard. What hap¬ 
pened to you after that ? ” 

Lumley recounted his experiences. 
As he talked he watched Simpson set¬ 
ting a table with white linen, blue china 
and shining spoons and cutlery. These 
preparations, in view of the fact that 
he had had a “ vaporized ” dinner the 


day before, and no supper, cheered him 
tremendously. Throughout the recital 
Jernyngham gave Lumley his absorbed 
attention. 

“ Whew! ” exclaimed the weather 
dictator, when the story was done, 
“ you fellows did have a time of it, and 
no mistake. Smith, 2006, was a pes¬ 
tiferous person, and I am glad he has 
been put out of the way. But your 
situation, Lumley, was not so perilous 
as it appeared. Those guards would 
never have dared to annihilate you with 
their electric guns. They knew too well 
that the vengeance of the dictators 
would be swift and sure.” 

“If you men have the whole city 
under your control,” asked Lumley, 
“ how is it possible for any of the citi¬ 
zens of the period to defy your 
authority? ” 

“ That was because they had Dr. 
Kelpie,” explained Jernyngham. “They 
used the doctor as a club, threatening 
him with death if we did not give up 
the important posts we occupy. Find¬ 
ing their threats would not intimidate 
us. Smith, 2006, used the doctor’s 
time-machine to go back into the past 
after more of you fellows. The situa¬ 
tion was becoming pretty serious,’and 
Jerry Dicks evolved that plot to help 
you escape. We know, now, why you 
anticipated Dicks’s activities. Of 
course, we’re not out of the woods yet, 
by a long shot, but we’re going to hang 
on to our powers and prerogatives. It’s 
great, Lumley, for a bunch of year 
1900 men to boss this year 2000! If 
you had a hand in the game you’d 
know how we feel.” 

“ You’ll have to leave these times, 
Miles,” said Lumley. - “ We came to 
rescue you and you’ve got to go back 
with us.” ; 

Jernyngham shook his head. 

“ Don’t you believe it! We’re doing 
a splendid work here, and Tod Plunkett 
is planning to extend our power over 
the whole country. We’ll never leave, 
Lumley.” 

“ But what will happen to Gig 
Lindley ? ” cried Lumley. 


“ I guess he will have to be sacrificed. 
The greatest good for the greatest 
number is our slogan.” 

The horror Lumley felt was too deep 
for words. But it was not a time to 
argue the point, for he was hungry, 
and a hungry man’s mind is not at its 
best. 

“ Where are the rest of our friends 
who escaped with me ? ” he inquired. 

“ McWilliams and Lindley were 
picked up by an air-ship belonging to 
the department of customs; Kinch and 
Mortimer were rescued by a detach¬ 
ment of muglugs under command of 
Jerry Dicks. Now that you and Jeffer¬ 
son Plunkett are accounted for, the 
only man missing is Dr. Kelpie. I 
presume that he and Plunkett are in the 
hands of the guards.” 

At. this moment Simpson began 
bringing in a number of covered 
dishes and placing them on the table. 
The appetizing odor he brought with 
him was most delightful. His final 
act was to place half a dozen cigars in 
the center of the table and push up a 
couple of chairs. 

“ All ready, sir,” he announced. 

“ Come, Lumley,” said Jernyngham, 
and got up and started toward the table. 

Lumley was smiling and rubbing his 
hands. He was very certain that never 
in his whole life had he been so nearly 
famished as he was at that moment. 

They paused on their way to the 
table, startled by cries from the chart- 
room. Before Jernyngham could in¬ 
vestigate the cause of the commotion, 
a short, fat man came puffing through 
the office door. 

His face was red and his little eyes 
glimmered. In one hand he held a 
small revolver, of the ancient 1900 pat¬ 
tern, and he fanned the point of it back 
and forth so that it covered impartially 
Jernyngham, Lumley, and Simpson. 

“ Stand where you are! ” he com¬ 
manded in a stuffy, determined voice. 

“Jeff—Jefferson Plunkett!” whis¬ 
pered Lumley, astounded. 

“ Yes,” answered the man with the 
weapon, a deadly menace in his tones, 


“Jeff Plunkett, on the road for Lockett 
& Biggs, hardware. This is a sample 
gun that I happened to find in my 
pocket. There are five lives in the 
cylinder, by James! Don't forget that. 
Sit" down! ” 

“ But I say, Plunkett,” began Jer¬ 
nyngham, “ we were about to—” 

“ Sit down! ” exploded Plunkett, 
wrathfully. 

Simpson did not wait to find a chair, 
but wilted to the floor. Jernyngham 
and Lumley backed warily to the seats 
they had just vacated and dropped into 
them again. 

Still watching the three, Plunkett 
moved to the table, took a chair facing 
them and rested the elbow of his gun- 
hand on the white linen. 

“ Now, listen,” he went on. “ I’m 
going to have a square meal, and you 
are going to stay right where you are 
and watch me eat it. If one of you 
makes a move, or speaks a word be¬ 
fore I light a cigar, there’ll be fire¬ 
works. I don't know a thing about 
electric guns and thunderbolts, but 
Buffalo Bill himself hasn’t anything on 
me when it comes to juggling a re¬ 
volver.” 

Cautiously Jefferson Plunkett laid 
the weapon beside his plate and pro¬ 
ceeded to relieve the very large famine 
that had afflicted him for twenty-four 
hours. Lumley watched him wistfully, 
even if a little fearfully, while Jer¬ 
nyngham looked on with humorous 
resignation. 

CHAPTER XIV. 
startling DEVELOPMENTS. 

Jefferson Plunkett made a clean 
sweep of everything on the table. 
Double portions of ham and eggs, fried 
potatoes, and toast vanished from be¬ 
fore him like magic. 

As the food disappeared his com¬ 
placency grew. When the plates were 
empty he selected a cigar, sniffed at it 
with the fastidiousness of a connois¬ 
seur, smiled gratefully and lighted it; 

then, very coolly, he appropriated the 
rest of the cigars and stowed them 
away in his pockets. 

“ Take it from me, gentlemen,” said 
he, “ that I have just experienced the 
pleasantest part of this little dream. 
My mind is beginning to smooth itself 
out and have a few lucid intervals. It’s 
a cinch that this situation is too many 
for me, and it’s another cinch .that I 
was shanghaied and pushed idto it 
against my will. From now on I shall 
demand what I need and enforce my 
demands with this sample of Locket & 
Biggs’s goods.” 

He picked up the revolver, patted it 
affectionately and dropped it into his 
coat-pocket. 

“ You may now,” he added, “ in¬ 
dulge in any conversation that seems 
appropriate.” 

Simpson, 5, had slipped from the 
room while Plunkett was lighting his 
cigar. He now, very warily, thrust his 
head in at the door. 

“ Dust is flying in Buffalo, Mr. 
Jernyngham,” he announced, “ and 
they are asking for a hundred-dollar 
sprinkle. Also a request comes from 
the Mohawk Valley for a thousand dol¬ 
lars’ worth of soaking rain.” 

“ Very good,” nodded Jernyngham. 
“ As soon as you hear from the treas¬ 
ury that Buffalo and Mohawk Valley 
have remitted, see that the sprinkle- 
plug is switched in for a twenty-minute 
precipitation at Buffalo, and that Mo¬ 
hawk Valley is lined with rain-plugs 
for a two-hours’ downpour.” 

“ Yes, sir.” 

Simpson „ disappeared. Plunkett 
grabbed the edge of the table, stared at 
Jernyngham, and his lower jaw fell. 
His cigar dropped into a plate. After 
a moment he mumbled to himself, 
picked up the cigar absently and re¬ 
sumed his smoking. 

“ Just as I’m beginning to feel toler¬ 
ably comfortable,” said he, “ something 
like this has to happen.” 

“ Mr. Plunkett,” spoke up Lumley, 
“ this gentleman is Miles Jernyngham, 
of the weather bureau.” 


Plunkett acknowledged the introduc¬ 
tion with a scowl and a nod. Jernyng¬ 
ham lifted his voice and called for 
Simpson. 

“ Duplicate that breakfast order, 
Simp,” said he, “ and see how quick 
you can do it.” 

He turned, to Plunkett. 

“ Lumley and I,” he went on, “ had 
just made up our minds that you had 
been recaptured, so your appearance 
here was in the nature of a pleasant 
surprise. How did you get away from 
the guards ? ” 

“ Miss Kennedy attended to that,” 
answered Plunkett. “ She dropped me 
through a grating in the dining-room 
and then led me up to the roof in a 
roundabout way. There we boarded 
the family flier. Miss Kennedy let me 
off on top of the weather bureau and 
told me to go down and look for 
friends.” 

A derisive smile dug creases in the 
drummer’s face. 

“ And I don’t think,” he finished, 
“ that I gave you a pleasant surprise 
when I showed up here; it was a sur¬ 
prise, all right, but the pleasure was 
mostly mine.” 

“ I’ve got to hand you a piece of my 
mind, Mr. Plunkett,” observed Jer¬ 
nyngham, “ and I might as well do it 
right now. I hope you’ll take it kindly, 
but you’ve got to take it, whether kind¬ 
ly or no. 

“ Your conduct toward those who 
came with you to these times has been 
most reprehensible. You seem, Plun¬ 
kett, to be constantly on the lookout 
for opportunities to betray your com¬ 
panions into the hands of their ene¬ 
mies. Now, we’re a little band of cast¬ 
aways who, by our native shrewdness 
and ability, have succeeded in getting 
a strangle - hold on our environment. 
We’ve got to hang together, under¬ 
stand? Eternal vigilance is the price 
of our success. Your brother, Tod, is 
the boss dictator, and on his account, 
if for no other reason, you ought to 
be with us rather than against us.” 

If Plunkett was impressed with these 

blunt remarks he failed to show it. He 
listened to Jemyngham with a derisive 
smile. 

“ I’m jerry to this, all right,” said 
he, “ that everything seems and that 
nothing really is. I’ve been doped, and 
when I come to you can bet your bot¬ 
tom sou marquee that I’m going to 
make things hot for the bunch that 
worked the hocus - pocus. When I 
wake up I want to have the satisfac¬ 
tion of knowing that I plugged for my 
side even while I was under the influ¬ 
ence of that funny powder. Just at 
present I’m little Alice Plunkett in 
Wonderland, and I’m very, very busy 
hunting a way back to Common-sense 
Junction, where I got off. Meanwhile, 
I’m going to be as obstreperous as I 
can.” 

Simpson came in, and began clear¬ 
ing away the table. Lumley watched 
him with interest and impatience. In 
fact, he was so wrapped up in the 
prospect of that delayed breakfast that 
he could not feel properly aggrieved 
at the stand taken l?y Jefferson Plun¬ 
kett. 

Jernyngham had it in mind to be 
very severe—there was no doubt at all 
about that—but before he could vent 
his indignation upon Plunkett some¬ 
thing else happened. A door opened 
and closed. Footsteps were heard ap¬ 
proaching hurriedly. There was an¬ 
other flurry of excitement in the chart- 
room; and then—Jasper Kinch flung 
himself ihto the office. 

“Ah, Lumley!” Kinch exclaimed. 
“ Glad to see you, Jernyngham. Ex¬ 
cuse brevity, but I’m in the biggest kind 
of a rush. Got an air-ship on the roof, 
and just dropped in for a moment to 
have a word with Lumley. I’m trying 
to corral all of our crowd at the office 
of the chief dictator. Mortimer, Rip¬ 
ley, and McWilliams are there, and 
Lumley is to join them at once. I’m 
off to get Dr. Kelpie.” 
i “ How did you know I was here ? ” 
inquired Lumley. 

“ The news came by transmit from 
Kennedy, 18.” 


“ Have you found Dr. Kelpie ? ” 

“ We’ve heard from him. The in¬ 
formation was brought by one of the 
guards, who was bribed by the doctor. 
Kelpie was recaptured, but while he 
was free he managed to hide the time- 
ball ; now he’s back in the old quarters 
in Amsterdam Avenue, with the guards 
doubled, and they’re going to use the 
thinkograph on him and discover 
where he secreted the main part of the 
time-machine. We’ve got to prevent 
that. Dicks is marching a strong force 
of muglugs at the double-quick to the 
Kelpie house, and I’m needed there to 
direct proceedings. I—” 

A sound of quick movement drew all 
eyes toward the office door. Jefferson 
Plunkett was just making a hasty exit. 

“ Come back here! ” shouted Kinch. 

“ Be hanged to you! ” flung back 
Plunkett, looking around and flourish¬ 
ing his revolver. “ Try to stop me 
and I’ll shoot. You’ll not get the 
time-ball—I want it myself.” 

He slammed the door, leaving those 
in the office staring at each other in 
apprehension and dismay. 

“ Confound the fellow! ” grunted 
Jernyngham. “ Not that this time- 
ball counts for much, so far as the dic¬ 
tators are concerned, but—” 

“ It counts for more than you 
know! ” cried the exasperated detect¬ 
ive. “ I wish I’d brought that electric 
gun. As it happens, I haven’t a weapon 
of any sort; but I’ll not let that stand 
in the way.” 

With that he flung open the door of 
the chart-room. The operators were 
huddled in one corner, like a lot of 
frightened sheep. Through the open 
door of the tube-room Jefferson Plun¬ 
kett could be seen puffing and flounder¬ 
ing on the flight of iron stairs that led 
to the roof. 

Followed by Lumley and Jernyng¬ 
ham, Kinch plunged on in fierce pur¬ 
suit. By the time the three reached the 
foot of the stairs Plunkett was out of 
the roof-door, and by the time the pur¬ 
suers reached the roof the machine that 
had brought the detective was on the 

wing, Plunkett balanced amidships and 
covering the pilot with his revolver. 

As he slipped swiftly away into 
space the hardware drummer gave vent 
to a wheezy, taunting laugh. 

“ If he gets that time-ball,” cried the 
panic-stricken Lumley, “ he’ll destroy 
it. He doesn’t know, he doesn’t un¬ 
derstand—” 

“ We’ve got to overhaul him! ” ex¬ 
claimed Kinch. “ Where’s another fly¬ 
ing-machine? I say, there, Jernyng- 
ham! We’ve got to have another ma¬ 
chine.” 

Jernyngham was hauling a red flag 
to the top of a short staff. 

“ I’m signaling for a municipal 
flier,” said he. “ Ah, ha! there’s one 
now, heading this way.” 

The municipal machine, which paid 
a license to the air - ship department 
and was for hire, rounded gracefully 
to a pause above the roof and then set¬ 
tled down into the stays. Kinch and 
Lumley ran up the steps and clambered 
aboard. 

“Follow that craft!” shouted Kinch, 
pointing south toward the other air¬ 
ship. 

The pilot started his helicopters; 
and then, when they were swinging 
well over the roof; turned on the pro¬ 
pellers. 

“ We’ll double-cross this little game 
of Plunkett’s,” declared the detective, 
with grim determination. “ By what 
process of reasoning has he convinced 
himself that he can get that time-ball, 
anyhow ? Why, he’s plain crazy, there 
is no doubt of that.” 

“ He’s plain troublesome, Jasper,” 
returned Lumley, “ and he seems to 
have a way of doing the wrong thing 
with a good deal of success. ‘ Plun¬ 
kett, the avenger,’ is surely an appro¬ 
priate name for him. I have awful 
forebodings that he is on the point 
of doing something rash ■— something 
that will result in a tremendous catas¬ 
trophe.” 

“You forget,” frowned Kinch, “that 
Plunkett is matching wits with me.” 

Thereupon he broke off the conver¬ 


sation, gave attention to the chase, and 
urged the driver to crowd on more 
power. 

CHAPTER XV. 

FRESH DIFFICULTIES. 

Two things were evident to those in 
the municipal flier. One was that the 
driver was doing everything possible 
to get the best speed out of the ma¬ 
chine, and the other was that they were 
barely holding their own in the chase. 

“We’re overloaded,” said the driver. 

“ You’re a man of the period,” cried 
Kinch fiercely, “ and on peril of your 
life tell me the truth: Are you for or 
against the dictators? Is there any 
reason for you to keep this air-ship 
back ? ” 

The driver shivered under the dead¬ 
ly menace of the detective’s voice and 
look. 

“ I’ve no quarrel with the dictators,” 
he whimpered. “ If I had, why should 
I hold this machine back? The man 
we’re chasing is one of your crowd. 
I tell you, sir, we’re overloaded.” 

Kinch appeared convinced of the 
driver’s sincerity. Never slow in ma¬ 
king up his mind, he had planned the 
next step before the pilot had done 
speaking. 

“ Hover over that roof, ahead 
there,” he ordered, pointing. “ Stop, 
but don’t land. Come to a standstill 
two or three feet above the landing- 
stage.” 

“ Very well, sir.” 

“ Sorry, Lumley,” said Kinch, “ but 
the craft is overloaded, and you’ll have 
to drop out on that roof and wait until 
I finish the chase and come back and 
pick you up. But be sure and wait. 
All of our crowd must be got together, 
and kept together. I’ll bag Plunkett, 
and we’ll halt his troublesome career 
by keeping him bound and under lock 
and key. By lightening ship we shall 
be able to overhaul the craft ahead.” 

Lumley was disappointed, but he 
had the utmost confidence in Kinch, 


and promptly fell in with his plans. 
The helicopters were holding the mu¬ 
nicipal machine a few feet above the 
landing-stage of the strange roof-top. 
Lumley climbed over the side, lowered 
himself to arms’ length, and dropped. 
He landed lightly, easily, and then 
watched while the air-ship resumed the 
chase. 

“ I hope nothing goes wrong,” he 
said to himself, turning to the edge of 
the platform and descending a short 
flight of steps to the roof. “If the 
time-ball falls into the hands of our 
enemies, there’s no telling where our 
troubles will end.” 

His worries on the score of Dr. Kel¬ 
pie and the time-ball had caused him 
to forget for the time being that he had 
been deprived of the morning meal, of 
which he stood very much in need. 
Now that he had been eliminated from 
the chase and its attendant excitement, 
his mind returned wistfully to the sub¬ 
ject of his lost breakfast. 

A sort of pergola, hard by the land¬ 
ing - stage and offering a shelter of 
flowering vines, invited him. He en¬ 
tered its cooling shadow and sat down 
on a cushioned bench. By a supreme 
effort of the will he sought to banish 
visions of ham and eggs, fried pota¬ 
toes, toast, and coffee. As a means to 
the end, he steered his thoughts in 
other channels. 

It was clear that the members of the 
Rescue Society were going to have a 
hard time prying the dictators loose 
from their powers and prerogatives 
and carrying them back into the past. 
Yet it must be done in some way. They 
had no moral right to tyrannize over 
the folks of the twenty-first century. 

People of different ages are differ¬ 
ently constituted. How would the peo¬ 
ple of the year 1901 have felt if some 
usurpers had come on from the year 
1800, banished the telegraph for the 
post - rider and retired incandescent 
bulbs in favor of tallow-dips? No, 
no! Surely a man has no right to any 
other era than that in which he is born. 

The castaways, perhaps not mali¬ 


ciously, were perpetrating a great 
wrong; and Lumley was grieved to 
note that a sordid spirit had entered 
into their operations, and that they 
were manipulating the weather, the 
culinary operations, and no doubt 
everything else, for their own finan¬ 
cial benefit. This was— 

Lumley’s reflections were cut short. 
What was that he heard? A groan? 
He started to his feet and listened in¬ 
tently. 

Yes, there was no mistake. Here 
was something that demanded investi¬ 
gation. 

Midway of the pergola’s length was 
the built-up hood that sheltered the 
roof-door. Lumley observed that the 
door was ajar, and he was not long in 
determining that the gruesome sounds 
he had heard were wafted through the 
opening. 

Cautiously he advanced to the door, 
pushed it wide, and stepped through. 
Descending the broad stairway a short 
distance, he looked over the balustrade, 
and an odd scene revealed itself to him. 

The room into which he had partly 
descended was the triclinium, or 
dining-room, of the household. It was 
a very rich apartment, with walls fres¬ 
coed by the hands of some master art¬ 
ist, and with chairs and couches up¬ 
holstered in the costliest fabrics. The 
grating, through which the food vapors 
were wont to ascend, was of yellow 
gold wrought out in an intricate and 
graceful design. 

On one side of this grating stood a 
table—a breakfast-table, as it were— 
brought from some peasant’s hut and 
put down in those luxurious surround¬ 
ings. It was covered with a paper 
cloth, and the dishes were of tin, evi¬ 
dently designed for other uses and 
pressed into service by sudden ne¬ 
cessity. 

There was a bowl-shaped dish half 
full of a dark liquid. At half a dozen 
places around the board were plates 
heaped with food — a sort of food 
Lumley could not remember ever hav¬ 
ing seen before. Six chairs were 





pushed back from the table. Those 
who had been eating were lying on 
couches, or were writhing in chairs, 
filled with a misery that found vent in 
heart-wrenching groans. 

Lumley grasped the situation in a 
moment. This was the result of de¬ 
cree 3165. These people of the period 
were trying to carry out the terms of 
the new law. For years they had sat 
at their golden grating, conversing 
pleasantly and absorbing their nutri¬ 
tion. Now they were trying to eat the 
solid, non-vaporized, non-deodorized 
food, and the result could not be other¬ 
wise than painful. 

Lumley’s heart went out to the suf¬ 
ferers, even as his indignation waxed 
strong against the dictators. It was a 
brutal decree. Famished as he was, 
however, the sight of that breakfast 
tempted him. Not one of the six mem¬ 
bers of the household paid him the 
slightest attention, and he descended 
quietly, drew up one of the chairs, and 
sat down at the table. 

He picked up a fragment of some¬ 
thing, tried to determine what it was 
by sight, and then by taste. It was 
hard and soggy and burned. He 
dropped it. Yes, he was hungrier than 
he had ever been in his life, but he 
couldn’t go that. 

“ Eat it,” commanded a hollow voice. 
“ It is called bread in the 1900 cook¬ 
book. You are from those distant 
times, and we ask a demonstration. 
Prove to us that the stuff is edible.” 

Lumley looked up. The man of the 
house evidently was standing before 
him. His absurd costume in nowise 
diminished the touching spectacle he 
presented. The pinched face and fe¬ 
verish eyes were mute evidences of 
starvation. 

“ My dear friend,” returned Lum¬ 
ley with feeling, “ I would put up with 
a good deal of personal inconvenience 
to eat this bread, if it were possible. 
But it isn’t. Your cook has made a 
botch of the baking.” 

“ Try one of those chops,” begged 
the man; “ there, beside the bread.” 


“ Chops ? ” echoed Lumley. “ These 
are not chops; they’re clinkers — 
burned to a cinder. No one could eat 
those things.” 

“ Have some of the coffee.’ 

Lumley tried it, and strangled. 

“ I can’t,” he sputtered. “ I’d like 
to oblige you if I could; but there’s a 
limit to what I can stand, even when 
I’m ravenous.” 

“ So! ” came from the other bitterly. 
“We are ordered by these usurpers to 
eat food that even they cannot endure, 
and they’ve always been eaters, while 
we have become absorbers. Our na¬ 
tures are delicately attuned to the beau¬ 
tiful and the progressive in life, and 
the coarseness of the act of mastication 
revolts us, even as the odors of the 
solid food is offensive. Mark my 
words: Decree 3163 will prove the 
undoing of these usurpers.” 

“Where did he come from?” 
queried another voice. 

Lumley looked around. All the male 
members of the household — four of 
them—were on their feet. The mother 
and daughter had lifted themselves on 
their couches and were staring at Lum¬ 
ley with reproachful eyes. 

Lumley explained that he had been 
set down on the roof by a friend, and 
was to be picked up later. He was one 
of the recent arrivals. While on the 
roof he had heard groans, and out of 
a desire to relieve a fellow creature’s 
distress he had intruded into the tri¬ 
clinium. 

He hoped they would pardon him. 
He felt for them deeply, and was sorry 
he was powerless to be of any help. 
If th'y would excuse him, he would go 
back to the roof again and wait for 
his friend’s air-ship. 

One of the sons sprang to the wall 
and pulled a switch. The roof-door 
could be heard to close. 

“ I opened that door,” said the 
young man, “ so that we could get the 
air. Now it is closed and fastened.” 

“ Well done! ” exclaimed the head 
of the house. “ Send a transmit to the 
headquarters of the opposition one of 
you. We will turn this man over to 
them.” 

Then, and for the first time, Lumley 
realized that his generous desire to aid 
the distressed had plunged him into 
trouble. To get to the roof was im¬ 
possible. The elevator opening was in 
the wall behind him, and he started up 
and retreated toward it. 

All the time he was executing his re¬ 
treat toward the elevator he was plead¬ 
ing with his enraged foes for their 
kindly consideration. 

One of the sons was taking down an 
electric rifle from the wall. Mother 
and daughter, clasped in each other’s 
arms, were on the verge of hysteria. 
But the father, tortured into fury by 
decree 3165, was eager for hostilities. 

Just as the young man turned with 
the electric rifle, Lumley fell backward 
into the elevator - cage. His falling 
body touched the spring that released 
the car, and he shot downward^ At 
the foot of the shaft he regained his 
feet and plunged through an open door. 

He was on the ground floor of the 
house, and above him he could hear 
sounds of wildest commotion—trans¬ 
mits shouted to the opposition, screams 
of women, wild shouts of the men, a 
patter of feet on broad staircases. 

Lumley gained a massive street door, 
only to find it locked. What was there 
to do? He fought with the door, and 
as he struggled he called wildly for 
help.. 

His calls, he frantically reasoned, 
were as useless as his attempts to open 
the door. Yet he must do something, 
and instinctively he continued to shout 
and wrench at the barrier with all his 
strength. 

Suddenly there was a crash, a ring¬ 
ing impact as of a ton of steel hurled 
against the door on its outer side. The 
stout wood shivered, and all but yield¬ 
ed. Again came the thunderous attack, 
and this time the door was burst in¬ 
ward. Lumley was flung backward to 
the floor. As he lay there he had a 
glimpse of a warrior muglug charging 
through the breach. 



The steel giant bent over Lumley, 
lifted him as easily as though he had 
been an infant, flung him across one 
shoulder, and made off with him. Out¬ 
side the house another muglug of the 
warrior class joined the first, and 
shoulder to shoulder the two rattled 
and clanged their way down the street. 

The relief Lumley might otherwise 
have felt was clouded with uncertainty. 
He was held to the muglug’s shoulder 
by a viselike grip of the iron hands, 
and every attempt he made to free him¬ 
self was met with firm resistance. 

The two muglugs were at large. 
Were they dependable, or had they re¬ 
belled against the authority of Jerry 
Dicks and gone on a bit of a rampage? 
Lumley could only wait and worry and 
hope for the best. 


CHAPTER XVI. 

TESTED AND EOUND 0. K. OR WANTING. 

Five minutes after Lumley had been 
rescued from the house where edict 
3165 had caused so much distress he 
was borne into a great building that 
fairly roared with activity. On every 
hand steel was smiting steel, and the 
din was terrific. 

Muglugs were at work building 
other muglugs. The steel mechanics 
were divided into groups, and each 
group had its own particular piece¬ 
work. 

Here were a dozen or so shaping, fit¬ 
ting, and riveting the metal heads; 
just beyond these were the torso-work¬ 
ers ; farther along were the toilers who 
hinged and jointed the wonderful 
arms and hands; over on the right 
were those whose business it was to 
fashion the legs and feet, and make 
perfect the clever joints at thigh, knee, 
and ankle; and then, last of all, were 
the assembling frames where each part 
was brought together, and the com¬ 
pleted muglug stamped with a number 
and laid aside for test and final ap¬ 
proval. 

Lumley, over the iron shoulder of 
the muglug who was carrying him, 
surveyed the establishment with won¬ 
der and admiration. He "had lost his 
fears, for the arrival at the factory 
had convinced him that, although the 
steel warriors were at large, they were 
by no means proceeding at random. 
Reassured as to his own personal safe¬ 
ty, he surveyed the plant with interest 
as he was carried through it. 

Passing out of the huge workshop, 
the two muglugs crossed a glassy plot 
and entered a small building. Lumley 
was placed in a chair, and the metal 
giants who had brought him ranged 
themselves side by side along the wall 
and lifted their hands to their fore¬ 
heads. 

A tow-headed usurper of perhaps 
twenty-five sat at a table in front of a 
number of blue-prints and received the 
salute. At the opposite end of the table 
was a hatchet-faced, thin-shanked man, 
who stared at Lumley as though at a 
ghost. 

“ Hello, Archibald Grant! ” ex¬ 
claimed Lumley. 

“ Well, what do you think of this ? ” 
muttered Grant. “ Where the deuce 
did those muglugs pick you up, Lum¬ 
ley? ” 

With the words, Grant came over 
and took Lumley by the hand. 

“ They saved my life, I think,” said 
Lumley, and explained his recent perils 
and the timely advent of the two iron 
warriors. 

“ Good! ” exclaimed Grant, striking 
his hands together in gratified approval. 
“ Write it down, Haskins, 23,” he add¬ 
ed, turning to his assistant at the desk; 
“ Nos. 9872 and 9873 tested and found 
O. K.” 

“ Very well, sir,” answered Haskins, 
and made an entry in a book. 

Grant faced the two muglugs. 

“ Proceed at once to the barracks,” 
he ordered, “ and report to Captain 
Dicks.” 

Again the metal warriors saluted, 
then wheeled and tramped away. 

“ As soon as the muglugs are fin¬ 
ished,” explained Grant, “ we send 


them out into the town to see how they 
behave themselves under the subcon¬ 
scious rays. If they prove tractable, 
and show the proper amount of initia¬ 
tive, they are passed; if, on the other 
hand, they are sullen, slow in their 
movements, and backward in obeying 
orders, they are repaired and tried 
again.” 

“ This is most remarkable! ” ex¬ 
claimed Lumley. 

“ It should not be—to you. It was 
your book which made such a factory 
as this possible. We are hustling out 
the muglugs as fast as we can. You 
see, the new edict that retires vapor¬ 
ized and deodorized food is a good way 
from being popular. A storm is going 
to break before long, and we’ve got to 
have the city properly policed.” 

“ I should say the edict wasn’t popu¬ 
lar ! It looks to me like a very unwise 
proceeding.” 

“ An elegant piece of graft, 
though,” chuckled Archibald Grant. 
“ They’ve already sold a million cook¬ 
books, and the gold for them is in the 
treasury. A year of this, Lumley, and 
every one of the dictators will be a 
plutocrat.” 

Regret and sorrow stabbed Lumley 
to the heart. Graft, graft! Were 
these dictators thinking of nothing 
else? Could they heap miseries upon 
the people for no other purpose than 
that of lining their treasury? 

Lumley felt that he would soon have 
to take up the cudgels in defense of an 
oppressed people. For the present, 
however, there were other matters to 
claim his attention. 

“ Have you heard anything about 
Dr. Kelpie and the time-ball ? ” he 
asked; “ or about Kinch’s pursuit of 
Jefferson Plunkett?” 

“ A couple of transmits came in just 
before you got here,” answered Grant. 
“ Dicks stormed the old Kelpie house 
with a company of muglugs and res¬ 
cued the doctor, and then the doctor 
recovered his precious time - ball. 
Kinch, also, was successful. He over¬ 
hauled Jefferson Plunkett and laid him 

by the heels; then he sailed back to pfck 
you off the roof where you had been 
left, and has been in a good deal of a 
funk ever since because he failed to 
find you. Haskins, 23 ”—and Grant 
turned to his assistant—“ just go into 
the transmit-room, will you, and report 
that Lumley is here at the muglug fac¬ 
tory? ” 

Haskins went into an adjoining 
chamber to send the transmit. All this 
good news left but one thing for Lum¬ 
ley to desire. 

“ Archibald,” said he, “ could you 
furnish me with a meal? I have had 
nothing to eat for more than twenty- 
four hours, and I’m nearly famished.” 

“ Why, sure, Lumley! ” cried Grant. 
“ Haskins, 23, and I have already had 
our dinner; but it won’t take us more 
than five minutes to get something 
through the tube for you. Haskins, 
send in a transmit for roast beef, 
hashed brown potatoes, bread, butter, 
apple pie, and coffee. Have the order 
rushed.” 

Haskins hurried away again. 

“ Pink Doolittle is the dictators’ 
chef, Lumley,” observed Grant. “ You 
remember Pink? He has a bloomer 
brigade to help him, and puts up a 
pretty fair line of eats. He’s pulling 
down a good thing now, and has a 
cooking school for the old vaporizers 
and deodorizers—busy every minute at 
a hundred dollars a minute. How’s 
that, eh? All our earnings go into a 
common fund, and when we get enough 
to retire we’re going to divide, share 
and share alike.” 

“ When you divide,” asked Lumley, 
“ where’ll you retire to ? ” 

A blank look crossed Grant’s face. 

“ We’ll cross that bridge when we 
get to it,” he answered indefinitely. 

“ Will you go back to 1901 ? ” 

“ Hardly. The taste of unlimited 
power we have had has changed our 
whole outlook. These are pretty good 
times, Lumley, for men with a little 
1900 snap and ginger. It’s a pity your 
Rescue Society ever bothered with us. 
Everything was going swimmingly un¬ 


til Kelpie blew into this era, hitched to 
his time machine.. He was the hostage 
around which all the opposition rallied. 
If it hadn’t been for him, Lumley, we’d 
have had no opposition. Of course, 
when the rest of you fellows came 
along, the situation was still more com¬ 
plicated. We’re getting everything 
pretty well in hand, though, and there 
are jobs for several more dictators— 
we can place all of you late arrivals in 
good positions.” 

Lumley shuddered. He would have 
expressed himself in no uncertain terms 
. had not his dinner arrived at that mo¬ 
ment. Without loss of time he began 
appeasing his hunger. 

While he ate, another pair of newly 
completed muglugs were carried into 
the office by the steel-workers in steel 
from the factory. These were laid, 
^grizzly mechanisms of inert metal, upon 
the floor. 

In the head of each was an oil-cup 
with a screw top. ■ Haskins opened the 
cups and filled them from a pipe in the 
wall. 

“ Open the power-plugs, Haskins,” 
instructed Grant, “ and then send a 
transmit to Head Center for two more 
rays.” 

Haskins opened a little doof-in the 
back of each muglug’s head and tin¬ 
kered for a moment with the power- 
plugs. After this he entered the trans¬ 
mit-room and sent in his call to Head 
Center. 

Sitting in his desk-chair, Archibald 
Grant bent two keenly critical eyes on 
the prostrate steel giants. One of them 
lifted its hand as the subconscious ray 
allotted to it by Head Center “ took 
hold,” and the other began to quiver 
uncannily. 

“ Get up,” ordered Grant. 

With a ringing jump each muglug 
gained its feet, imbued with power 
from the laboring human mind at Head 
Center. 

“ Have you made the record, Has¬ 
kins?” inquired Grant. 

The assistant was writing in his 
book. 

“ No. 9874 and No. 9875,” he re¬ 
plied. 

“ You two,” proceeded Grant, again 
addressing the muglugs, “ will proceed 
to the Hudson River and return by 
way of the Pleasure Gardens to this 
office. Be gone an hour—no longer. 
Go!” 

He waved his hand authoritatively. 
One of the muglugs whirled on its iron 
heel and started out. The other hesi¬ 
tated, an ominous, whirring sound issu¬ 
ing from its hollow interior. 

“ The sledge, Haskins! ” called 
Grant, rising. 

Haskins gripped an iron hammer 
that hung in a rack on the wall. At 
the same moment the defective steel 
giant rushed at Grant like a modern 
monster upon puny Frankenstein. 
Grant leaped clear, and Haskins struck 
a clanging blow on the muglug’s head 
with the hammer. 

A vital spot had been touched, and 
the power-plug disarranged. The steel 
warrior clumped down on the floor in 
a disorganized mass, and twitched and 
struggled feebly. Haskins bounded 
into the transmit-room, and could be 
heard signaling Head Center. 

“ Mug 9875 defective! Withdraw 
the ray.” 

Instantly No. 9875 stiffened out, and 
lay silent and still. 

“ It happens once in a while,” re¬ 
marked Grant grimly. “ Call a couple 
of workers, Haskins, and send 9875 to 
the repair-shop.” 

As two toilers from the work-shop 
were carrying away the defective mug- 
lug, a glittering air-ship hovered sud¬ 
denly over the grassy sward between 
the office and the factory, then dropped 
lightly and swiftly into the factory 
hangar. 

Through the open door of the office 
Lumley could see a determined-looking 
man step out of the craft and come 
down the hangar steps. On either side 
of him marched a warrior muglug, 
overlaid with gold and silver filigree- 
work and armed with an electric rifle. 

“Now, what’s up?” remarked 


Grant, in a puzzled tone. “ Here’s the 
chief dictator, and he isn’t due to in¬ 
spect the plant for a week yet. Some¬ 
thing’s wrong, that’s a cinch.” 

Escorted by his glittering body¬ 
guard, Tod Plunkett, the chief dicta¬ 
tor, hastened across the strip of lawn 
and entered the office. 


CHAPTER XVII. 

THE EAST STRAW. 

“ How are you, Tod? ” cried Lum¬ 
ley, rising to greet the chief dictator. 

“ Lumley, old man,” returned Plun¬ 
kett effusively, “ the sight of you is 
good for sore eyes. Welcome again to 
the year 2000! Things are vastly dif¬ 
ferent now from what they were on 
your previous visit. The castaways 
have got a strangle-hold on the times, 
old chap, and we’re out for reform 
with a big R. There’s a job waiting 
for you, and as soon as I got the trans¬ 
mit from the muglug factory giving 
news of your whereabouts, I climbed 
into the Meteor and flew over this way. 

“ Say, Lumley, you’ll never want to 
leave. You’ll want to cast in your lot 
with ours and become one of the dic¬ 
tators. All the others who came with 
you have accepted places of power, and 
we couldn’t think of leaving you out.” 

“What’s that?” asked Lumley, 
thinking he had not heard aright. “ Do 
you mean to say that Kinch, Mortimer, 
Ripley, McWilliams, and — and Dr. 
Kelpie have become dictators? ” 

“ Exactly! ” laughed Tod Plunkett. 
“ Kinch is dictator of the secret serv¬ 
ice, and his fees and perquisites should 
amount to several millions a year. I’ve 
split up the department of foods, rai¬ 
ments, and beverages, and Mortimer 
goes in as dictator of raiments, while 
McWilliams rules the beverage bureau. 
I left Mortimer preparing an edict 
which makes it a crime to wear bloom¬ 
ers of the period, and declares that on 
and after thirty days from date clothing 
of the year 1900 must be secured from 
the tailors of the raiment department. 

How’s that for a rake-off? Ripley be¬ 
comes dictator of dentistry and medi¬ 
cine, and already his department is 
rushed to death on account of edict 
3126. His returns—” 

Lumley’s brain was dizzy. 

“ But what is Dr. Kelpie doing ? ” 
he interrupted hoarsely. 

“ He is dictator of microcosmol¬ 
ogy,” replied Plunkett. “ It is his busi¬ 
ness to watch the play of the various 
elements in our little world, and advise 
as to what must be done to keep in 
good health the goose that lays the 
golden egg. I hope you understand 
what I mean? ” and the chief dictator 
gave a shrewd wink. 

The room was whirling around Lum- 
ley, and he gripped the back of a chair 
to steady himself. He had been count¬ 
ing upon his fellow members of the 
Rescue Society for aid in persuading 
the castaways to leave careers of tyran¬ 
ny and graft and go back comfortably 
to 1901. Now these props had fallen 
away from him; they had even gone 
to support that nefarious structure of 
oppression and tribute so cunningly 
raised by the usurpers. 

Everson Lumley stood alone—alone 
against all this cruel greed which the 
twentieth century had unloaded upon 
the twenty-first. Ah, Dr. Kelpie, Dr. 
Kelpie, who could have believed it of 
you! But, stay! Lumley had one 
thought like a forlorn hope. 

“ Tod,” said he, “ what office have 
you given your brother Jefferson? ” 

“ I haven’t seen Jefferson as yet,” 
was the reply; “ but I shall certainly 
have a good dictatorship for Jeff. As 
for you, Lumley, what more fitting 
than that you should be supervisor gen¬ 
eral of the subconscious rays? You 
can have a blue and gold office in the 
Head Center Building, and make sure 
that the rays are at all times efficient 
and properly directed. There’s no 
chance for graft; but what’s the odds ? 
All our pickings are thrown into a com¬ 
mon fund, and when we’ve had enough 
of the game we’ll split even. What do 
you say ? ” 


Lumley had not the slightest inten¬ 
tion of allying himself with the free¬ 
booters. He was consecrated to the 
one purpose of rescuing all of them 
from their reprehensible careers and 
restoring them to spheres of respectable 
activity in their own times. But if he 
gained his end against such overwhelm¬ 
ing odds, he must proceed warily. 

“ I’ll have to think about it, Tod,” 
he said. “ I can’t give you an answer 
offhand.” 

“ Better come in with us, Lumley,” 
urged Archibald Grant. 

“ We’ll see about that later,” was 
Lumley’s evasive response. “ I think, 
Tod,” he went on to the chief dictator, 
“that decree 3165 was a mistake. It 
is causing a tremendous amount of dis¬ 
tress, and the people will not put up 
with it. That decree, I should judge 
from my limited observation, is the last 
straw.” 

Tod Plunkett frowned. 

“ The people will have to put up with 
it! ” he declared. “ Our muglug army 
will force them to carry out the terms 
of the edict. 'The will of the dictators 
is the law of the land. Come along 
with me, Lumley. We’ll go back to 
headquarters.” 

The head dictator turned to Grant. 

“ Hustle the work here, Archibald,” 
said he. “ Every capable muglug you 
turn out is another rivet in the fabric 
of our power. The stronger we are, 
the farther we can go; and the farther 
we go, the more successful our infor¬ 
mation.” 

“ By working night and day, Tod,” 
replied Grant, “ we can turn out, on an 
average, twenty-five mugs, tested and 
O. K/d, every twenty-four hours. 
Only about one in ten is defective.” 

“ Good work! Keep it up. I’ll be 
around for regular weekly inspection 
on Saturday next. Good-by. All 
ready, Lumley.” 

The two products de luxe of the 
muglug factory, especially constructed 
for the chief dictator’s body-guard, 
marched back to the gleaming air-ship 
as they had marched away from it—
