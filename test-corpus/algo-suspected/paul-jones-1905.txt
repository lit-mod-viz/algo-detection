CHAPTER I. 

THE EBONY BOX. 

"Capt. Paul Jones, Col. Washington!” 

"Ah! He, comes by appointment, Mr. Henry. Pray 
admit him.” 

Patrick Henry pulled the door wide open. 

"Come in, captain,” he smiled; “you’re expected.” 

The young planter entered the room and was greeted 
with warm handclasps from the other two gentlemen 
present—Col. Washington and Mr. Hewes. 

“You have been for some time in Williamsburg, Paul,” 
said Mr. Hewes, “and I regret that I could not have seen 
you before; but Col. Washington and Mr. Henry have 
told me what you discovered to the south of Norfolk— 
how British mercenaries are committing piratical acts

alQng our shores, -under supposed connivance of min¬ 
isters -of the Crown.”* 

“ 5 T\vas a gallant service/' observed Col. Washington, 
“hut no more than might be expected from Capt. Jones.” 

.Patrick Henry's thin face grew animated, and his eyes 
sparkled. 

•“Unless I am sore mistaken,” said he, “we shall stand 
in need of such a man as Paul Jones before we are many 
months older.” 

“We stand in need of him now,” returned Mr. Hewes. 

“That is why he is here,” added Col. Washington. 

.“My sword,” said the young captain gallantly, “and 
my life, as well, are at the service of these oppressed 
Colonies. I am a Virginian to the core-” 

Henry leaned forward and dropped a hand on his 
arm. 

“Sav,; rather, Capt. Paul,” he broke in, “that you are 
an American. That is better than saying you are a Vir¬ 
ginian. We are all Americans!” 

And thus early did Patrick Henry voice a sentiment 
which, later in that memorable year of 1774, was to ring 
through Carpenters' Hall, in Philadelphia. Under the 
noble Henry's magic eloquence, it was to carry the Con¬ 
tinental Congress by storm. 

“Ay,” cried the young planter, clapping hand to the 
sword at his side and straightening his broad' shoulders, 
“I am an American, an’ it please you, arid hope in my 
soul that presently I may have a chance to prove my right 
to the title!” 

The older men smiled approval of the youth's enthu¬ 
siasm. 

“Your sloop is handily by, Capt. Paul?” queried Mr. 
Hewes. 

“In the York River, sir, off Yorktown.” 

“And you are ready for a quick journey back to her?” 

“My boy, Caesar, is holding the horses at the tavern 
door. I take the road the minute I leave this room.” 

“Always ready,” murmured Col. Washington, a shade 
of admiration crossing his grave features. 

The conference was being held in the best room of 
Master Gay's coffee house, in Nicholson Street. 

The conversation, when it came to the particular matter 

; *These discoveries^ of deep significance to the patriot leaders 
in the Colonies at this time, were made by the dashing young 
sailor-planter several days before. The chronicle of his thrill¬ 
ing adventures that led up to the discoveries is set forth in.

that concerned the patriots, was in low voices; and every* 
thing else had been done to insure its privacy. 

s 

From the breast of his broadcloth coat Mr, Hewes drew 
a small, ebony box. ... 

“This box, Capt. Paul,” said he, placing the object on^ 
the table, “contains instructions and other papers of great 
value. Were they to fall into the hands of the king’s^, 
men, the king’s ministers would make the lot of these 
devoted Colonies even more bitter and unhappy than it 
is at present—and we have woes enough now, Heaven 
knows. 

“There is no one to whom I could intrust the box with’ 
more confidence than to you. Yovuare to take it to your 
plantation, guard it with your life, if necessary, andj 
deliver it only to the man who will call for it with a writ¬ 
ten order from Mr. Adams. That man, an' he be the 
right one. has the key. To make assurance doubly sure, 
you will have him produce the key and open the box in 
your presence.” 

“You may rely upon me, sir." said Paul Jones, calmly. 
“Who is this man who is to call for the box?” 

Mr. Hewes exchanged glances with Air. Henry and 
Col. Washington. 

“That,” he went on, “I cannot tell you. The box will 
be called for, and you are to deliver it when-you have 
made certain the man who calls is entitled to it.” , 

“Very well, gentlemen; the matter will be attended to 
in exact accordance with .your instructions.” 

Mr. Hewes drew a long breath. 

“I feel even safer with the box in your possession than 
in my own,” he murmured. “Perform this service faith¬ 
fully, and I assure you you hqve friends who will not 
forget it.” { 

“If I am aiding the cause of America against an un- 
just king,” answered Paul Jones, “the work is its own 
reward.” 

Once more the patriot leaders pressed his hand warmlyj 
Capt. Paul stowed the little box safely ^way in the breast] 

of his coat and took his departure. j 

! 

As he descended the stairs and passed through the 
long, well-filled public room of the coffee house, a maHj 
started up from an obscure corner. I 

He was a heavy-set, broad-shouldered person, and, al-j 
though* he wore a shirt of coarse dowlas and leather] 
breeches, the roll in his gait would have proved to anyone 
that his calling was the sea. . . .: 

Furthermore, his head was bound in a piece of dirty!

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Inen, and from under the bandage his eyes glared tiger- 
shly at Capt. Paul. 

For a moment the man stood watching the retreating 
orm of the young sailor-planter, then hurriedly passed 
tut of the room at a side entrance. 

In front of the coffee house a negro lad was sitting 
m one horse and holding another by the reins. 

“All right, Caesar?” asked Capt. Paul, taking the reins 
rom the negro’s hand. 

“All right, Marse Paul,” answered Caesar. “Is we 
wine to Yawktown, sah?” 

“With all dispatch.” 

Capt. Paul swung to the saddle. 

He did not start immediately, but pulled up in a glow 
f light that issued from a window of the coffee house. 

Taking a pair of pistols from their red velvet holsters 
1 front of him, he examined them carefully. 

“Must be Marse Cap’n is lookin’ fo’ trouble on de 
Tawktown road,” thought Caesar; then he chuckled. 
Golly! If any trouble comes, I’d suah hate to be at de 
dder end ob it when Marse Cap’n has dem flintlock 
oppin’ machines in his hands.” 

Having satisfied himself that the pistols were in or- 
er, Capt. Paul thrust them back into their holsters, gath- 
red up the reins and spurred along the darkened and 
alf-deserted street. 

Presently they turned from Nicholson into Duke of 
Gloucester Street, a broad, unpaved, dusty thorough- 
are, edged with mulberries and poplars, and stretching 
rom the gate of William and Mary College to the brick 
iqade of the Capitol. 

t Here gay blades of the town, in groups or singly, 
vere proceeding homeward, lighted on their way by 
•pluttering flambeaus in the hands of link-boys. 

1 Many a rollicking and half-tipsy song was in the air, 
mt young Capt. Paul gave no attention to sights or 
Mounds along the-way. 

1 With bowed head he rode onward, Caesar following him 
>y two or three horses’ lengths. 

: Skirting a meadow that formed part of the college 
grounds, they plunged through a grove of elms and 
vere soon fairly on the road to the York River. 

Here Capt. Paul struck into a planter’s pace, pulling 
iis riding cloak snugly about him to keep out the flying 
lust. 

The miles slipped away from under his horse’s hoofs. 

The youth could feel the ebony box pressing against 


his breast under his waistcoat, and the thought that he 
was to gain the York without placing the precious papers 
in jeopardy filled him with deep satisfaction. 

Nevertheless, in Capt. Paul’s life he had been taught 
that the unexpected was the thing that usually hap¬ 
pened. 

In a little while the horseman descended a low hill, and 
when they reached the foot of it the glimmer of a light 
was seen in advance, in a tangle of timber that edged both 
sides of the road. 

Sounds reached the ears of Capt. Paul, too—a tramp 
as of frightened horses coupled with an oath in a hoarse 
voice. 

A moment later there came a wild call in shrill, feminine 
tones: 

“Help! Oh, is there no one to protect me? Help!” 

The gallant, young planter was not the one to hang 
back in the face of such an appeal. 

Since his sword was ever his favorite weapon, he 
drew it, shouted for Caesar to follow, and raced toward 
the light ahead. 

As he drew nearer, the flickering gleam resolved it¬ 
self into a lanthom, carried beside a driver on a pon¬ 
derous coach. 

The coach had four sable horses attached, and at the 
heads of the leaders was a mounted man, barring the way 
and pointing a pistol at the negro on the box. 

Another man had dismounted at the coach door, which 
was flung open. 

In a twinkling, Capt. Paul drew a pistol with his left 
hand and fired at the fellow at the horses’ heads—fired 
as he galloped, and with the dark night making him none 
too sure in his aim. 

Capt. Paul could use either hand with equal facility, 
and but for the darkness, and the wild pace at which he 
rode, he well knew that the bullet would have found its 
mark. 

As it was, the man at the horses’ heads fired a weapon 
of his own, so that a bullet sang uncomfortably close to 
Capt. Paul’s ear. 

After making use of his own pistol, the fellow wheeled 
about and vanished in the darkness of the timber. 

The young planter swept on toward the other man. 

That individual, however, showed the white feather. 

Hurling himself astride his horse, he was away before 
the young planter’s slashing sword could reach him. 

Capt. Paul did not give pursuit; his concern was 



PAUL TONES WEEKLY. 


chiefly for the woman in distress, whose voice had brought 
him to the scene. 

Pulling his horse back opposite the swinging coach 
door, he peered into the interior of the vehicle. 

The darkness there was so intense he could see 
nothing. 

‘‘Oh, mah po’ missis 1” wailed the black coachman. 
“What have dem robbahs done to mah po’ missis ?” 

He started as though he would abandon the four plun¬ 
ging horses, leap to the ground and investigate his mis¬ 
tress’ condition. 

Had he carried out his intention, a runaway would have 
been imminent. 

“Stay where you are,” ordered Capt. Paul, “and hold 
the horses!”’ Then, leaning further into the coach, he 
cried: “I say, madame! Are you alone? I trust you 
are uninjured?” 

A choking moan was the only reply. 

Hastily sheathing his sword, Capt. Paul slipped clear 
of the saddle and climbed into *he coach. 

In another instant, a pair of steellike arms went round 
him and he was thrown backward upon one of the seats. 

Simultaneously, the door of the coach was slammed 
shut; and thereupon a voice hissed in his ear: 

“Those papers! Give me those papers intrusted to you 
by the archtraitors, Washington, Hewes and Henry, or, 
by Heaven, your life pays the forfeit!” 

CHAPTER II. 

THE TABLES TURNED. 

Capt. Paul Jones had been neatly trapped. 

Nothing but the appeal of a woman, seemingly in 
distress, could have tempted him to hazard the valuable 
box so recently consigned to his care. 

The villainous play had been bravely carried out, and 
at no little risk to the players. 

The patriot leaders, who had requested Jones to take 
the box to his plantation and hold it until called for, had 
thrown as much secrecy as possible about theirjdans and 
operations. 

That the secret of the papers was out was due rather 
to Tory guile and vigilance rather than to any lack of 
cautiousness on the part of the patriots. 

While not expecting to encounter difficulties, Capt. Paul 
was on the alert for them; but he would have looked upon 
himself as a heartless wretch had he passed a woman who 
needed aid, and failed to give it. 


The two men who had seemingly fled had presumabl 
not retired far enough to get out of the plot. 

One or other pf them had slammed the coach door. 

Directly after the hissing demand for the papers h, 
been made, the black coachman put his four horses 
the gallop, and the lumbering vehicle swayed and bounds 
at a terrific speed. 

Although trapped, the daring, young captain was ni 
captured. 

“You get nothing from me!” he cried, defiantly, exeri 
ing all his wonderful strength. 

“Struggle at your peril, Capt. Jones!” came a woman 
voice, with a hiss like a venomous serpent. “Here! Do 
feel this?” 

A point of cold steel was pressed against the youn 
captain’s forehead. 

“We take the papers,” the merciless voice went ot 
“whether it be from you alive or dead!” 

The blank darkness inside the coach prevented CafF 
Paul from seeing a thing. 

He was fighting in the dark with a woman and a ma 
for his unknown foes. 

Without the coach he knew there were at least thre 
more enemies—the negro driver and the two miscreanj 
who had simulated flight in order to avoid his weapons. 

Much as he disliked battling with a woman, no oth$ 
choice was left open to the young captain. 

Although somewhat slender and of only mediup 
height, Capt. Paul had a superb breadth of shoulders ah 
was noted for his strength and prowess. 

His arms were pinioned at his sides by the man, but h 
feet were free, and he used them with such sudden an 
telling effect that the woman was thrown back in tl 
coach with a cry of pain, her pistol dropping frem 
hand. 

Capt Paul then gave his attention to the man. 

The swaying of the coach rolled them from ttye seal 
at that precise instant, the young captain summoned a 
his strength for a supreme effort and broke from h 
antagonist’s arms. , 

The report of a pistol followed; and it must have bee 
the woman who fired, for Capt. Paul’s enemy, with 
groan of pain, tumbled helplessly at the young planter' 
feet. 

A cry of consternation broke from the woman’s lips. 

The moment was ripe for escape, and Capt Paul too 
advantage of it

Had he not been the guardian of that ebony box, he 
Mild have followed his bent and remained with his un- 
iown enemies until there had been developments more 
i accord with strict justice; as it was, he felt that he 
bst not tarry a moment, now that escape lay open to 
to. 

With a stout kick he sent the coach door crashing out- 
iard. 

Wounded though the other man was, he made one de- 
lairing effort to detain Paul Jones. 

There was a final struggle, albeit a brief one, and 
hen the young planter gained the road—which he did on 
Xnds and knees, and roughly, as might be expected— 
: was gripping a memento of the baffled plot in the 
lape of a wig. 

The two horsemen, who had enacted the role of rob- 
ts, were galloping along ahead of the coach, which was 
■veling in the direction of Williamsburg. 

?They had heard the shooting, and had witnessed the 
ung planter’s leap into the road. 

«The black tugged at the reins and the horsemen started 
ck. 

At the selfsame moment, the frightened Caesar came 
Sloping up with his master’s horse. 

“Is dat you, Marse Cap’n?” queried the black, peer- 
g at the figure in the road. 

“Ay, Caesar!” answered Capt. Paul, springing erect. 
“Is yo’ hurted, marse?” 

“In no way,” was the answer, as the young captain 
iped to his horse’s back and drew from its holster the 
stol he still had. 

A shot over his left arm wounded one of the approach- 
g riders; and immediately he used his spurs and charged 
e other. 

This onslaught, from a man who appeared to be in- 
ncible, was too much for the rascals, and they whirled 

t*d fled in the wake of the coach, the uninjured man sup- 

* 

6 rting his wounded comrade. 

Capt. Paul drew rein and faced the other way with a 
rim laugh. 

v“The rogues have had their trouble and some hard 
faling for their pains,” he muttered; “they’ll think twice 
fcfore they attempt to trick Paul Jones in that way

gam. 

; “Ain’t yo’ gwine to foller ’em, Marse Cap’n ?” asked 
^'surprised Caesar, who well knew what a hot spark his 
faster was when dealt with as he had been that night 


“No, Caesar,” was the reply. “There is other business 
in hand, and we have scant time. There is an ordinary 
near here, an’ I mistake not. We will take a short rest 
at the place.” 

The ordinary was at a crossroads, half a mile further 
on the way to the York. 

Its windows were dark, but a few lusty blows on the 
front door brought a glow from above, and- a night- 
capped head was thrust out and demanded their busi¬ 
ness. 

“Half an hour’s rest and a bottle of Madeira,” answered 
Paul Jones. “At the same time, friend, I would have a 
few words with you on an important matter.” 

The landlord hastily dressed himself, descended and 
admitted Capt. Paul into the public room. 

The Madeira was set forth, and a glass of it ordered 
to be taken to Caesar, who was looking to the horses. 

While the landlord was in front of his establishment, 
the young captain examined the wig that had come with 
him out of the coach. 

It was a Blenheim wig, of goat’s hair, bushy at the 
sides and with a long, plaited tail, ornamented with a 
ribbon at the top of the braid and at the bottom. 

The color was black, and on one side the hair wore a 
brown and singed look. 

Capt. Paul seemed startled. 

He had seen such a wig not many days before, and 
was wondering if it were possible to identify the wearer 
of the wig by the wig itself. 

When the landlord returned, the young captain began 
to quiz him. 

“Are we the first travelers you entertained this night?” 

“Nay, sir,” replied the landlord, “my establishment was 
honored by a lady of quality, who came to it in a coach 
and four, with a black for driver, and two outriders, and 
a companion who, I took it, was more a guard than a 
friend.” 

“When was this?” asked Capt. Paul. 

The landlord’s description tallied with the party just 
met and worsted on the road. 

“They came some two hours since, and bided until 
half an hour agone, when a strapping big fellow, in 
dowlas shirt and leathern breeches, his head swathed in 
a bandage, came and had talk with the lady and her 
escort. They left immediately after.” 

“Tell me m# re about this man who seemed to be the 
lady’s companion.”

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


“He was brown, sir, almost like an Indian, and wore 
jack boots, and talked and walked like a sailor. By my 
faith, ye have there his wig, or one like it.” 

The landlord pointed to the piece of headgear on the 
table. 

“Did you learn the name of the lady, or of any of her 
companions?” asked Capt. Paul. 

“Nay, sir, they were close-mouthed, and said little in 
my hearing.” 

“Did the man with the bandage around his head go 
away with the rest ?” 

“I think not. When the coach left, I did not see hint 
among the others. However, he went from the inn at 
the same time the rest did.” 

The young planter would have asked more questions, 
but at that juncture Caesar was heard from. 

“Marse Cap’n! Marse Cap’n!” 

The boy was excited over something, as the young 
planter could easily tell. 

Leaping up from the table, he ran out of the inn, the 
landlord tight at his heels. 


CHAPTER III. 

THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGED HEAD. 

Exciting events were crowding fast upon each other 
that night. 

When Capt. Paul reached the entrance, he saw a most 
surprising scene in the light that came from the public 
room of the inn. 

Caesar was sitting up on the ground a few feet'away 
from his horse. 

He was holding his woolly head in his hands and had 
evidently been struck from the saddle with a fierce blow. 

A large man, wearing dowlas shirt and leather breeches 
and having his head bandaged, was trying to mount the 
negro’s horse. 

With one foot in the stirrup, the man was seeking to 
rise to the saddle; but the horse, no doubt frightened by 
the rough work that had just been done across its back, 
was leaping sideways, so that the man was obliged to 
hop on one foot, and could not find opportunity to mount. 

The fellow was swearing heartily. 

At sight of Capt. Paul and the landlord, the man made 
one more desperate attempt. 

“That’s the fellow we were- speaking afyut, sir l” cried 
the landlord. 


The horse, still further terrified by the hurried appro* 
of Capt. Paul and the landlord, reared upward. 

The man who was seeking to mount was cast to t 
ground, and came within an ace Of being trampled ouj 

Breaking from his hand, the horse snorted and gallop 
along the road. 

“Take my mount, Caesar,” cried Capt. Paul, “and cat 
the other horse.” 

The black regained his feet and was soon in Oq 
Paul’s saddle. 

While he dashed away after the horse, the yovu 
planter took after the man who had caused the trouble 

That worthy, recognizing his peril, sprang up ai 
flung away into the darkness as fast as his legs coo 
carry him. ; 

He did not keep to the road, but turned from it it 
the brush and timber at the roadside. 

Capt. Paul, knowing he would have a bootless chase 
he gave* pursuit, returned to the inn, regained posse 
sion of the wig and stood in the door with the landlo 
awaiting the return of the black boy. 

“If that rascal had a horse,” said Capt. Paul, “w 
should he want another?” i 

“His horse was far spentj sir,” answered the landloi 
“I noticed that, when he left here. I’ll lay ye a punches 
that he and the rest o’ the rascally crew are ripe for tf 
hangman. But the woman! She seemed like a persi 
of consequence, sir, and it passed my wits that s 
should be in such company.” 

"Was there anything about her by which she cov 
be identified if seen again?” 

“There was a scar, as I remember, or a birthmai 

it may be, on her right cheek: a little, red line; 

shape like a letter 'S.’ And she was passing fair, sir, s 

though I can take my oath not over young. But tb 

wig! May I ask how you came in possession of it?”: 

* 

Capt. Paul did not set the landlord’s mind at rest a 
to the way he had secured the Blenheim wig. 

Caesar came clattering up, just then, leading the rq 
away horse. Under cover of his arrival, Capt. Pi 
found it easy to ignore the landlord’s question. 

“I’s got de horse, Marse Cap’n,” said Caesar. 

“How came you to lose him, lad ?” 

“You seen dat man wif de cloth tied ’round his haidi 

“Yes.” i 

“Well, sah, I sat heah waitin’ fo* you, when dat ffl

knowed I was on de ground, an’ de man was trvin’ to

ip'n. an’ you know de rest.” 

“Barring a slight delay,” said Capt. Paul, swinging to 
s own saddle when Caesar had changed horses, “we’re 
pie the worse off for the rascal’s attempt to get away 
ith the mount.” 

,‘Ts got a roarin’ in mah eahs, marse, dat’s far from 
mfo’table,” muttered Caesar, tenderly rubbing the side 
j his head. # 

/The young planter paid no attention to the rueful re- 
ark, but loaded his pistols and returned them care- 
3 lly to the red velvet holsters; then, settling with the 
idlord, he clapped spurs to his horse and was soon off 
,ce- more on the way to Yorktown. 

£The young patriot was not a little puzzled in his mind. 
)From all he could learn, the man who had assisted the 
iman inside the coach was none other than a piratical 
Alawag who sailed under the name of Skull-and-Cross- 
nes Cockle. 

jCapt. Paul thought he had left Skipper Cockle in the 
ieat swamp south of Norfolk; and thus to encounter 
m, after a lapse of several days, on the road to York 
iver, was in the nature of a tremendous surprise. 
Cockle, bearing Capt. Paul a black grudge, had sworn 
have his life. 

This vow in nowise worried the young planter, for he 
is ready to settle scores with Cockle wherever and when- 
er that worthy deemed best to try conclusions. 

By the same token, the fellow with the bandaged head 
as recognized by Capt. Paul as Cockle’s right-hand 
bn. If it hadn’t been for the young planter the rascal’s 
"jad would never have needed a bandage, so the rogue 
id sufficient cause for enmity on his own account. 

But how was it that Skipper Cockle and the disguised 
fen-o’-war’s man had trimmed their sails on this new 
kk bothered the young planter not a little. 

The woman in the case did not cause him so much 
pnder. 

She was probably Tory, and filled with an ardent desire 
> help the king’s cause, no matter to what extreme' she 
tight be driven. 

iWith such thoughts as these Capt. Paul beguiled the 
fmainder o£ his journey. 


By dawn he-and Caesar had reached Yorktown, and 
had returned their hired mounts to the liveryman of whom 
they had been secured for the ride to Williamsburg; and 
by early morning the two had rejoined the twenty-ton 
sloop belonging to Capt. Paul, and she was picking her 
way down the river. 

The winds served poorly, and it was the forenoon of 
the next day before the boat drove into the Rappahan¬ 
nock. 

Capt. Paul was standing well forward with Alec Gil¬ 
pin, a lad who had accompanied him on the cruise to 
Norfolk, as the}- drew in sight of the plantation. 

The warehouse and the landing unfolded slowly before 
their eyes. 

“Great Jemimy, captain!” cried Alec. “There's a 
crowd around your warehouse, an' it ain’t a crowd o’ 
blacks, neither.” 

The young planter had already descried the throng. 

When the sloop came closer he made out the faces of 
some of the neighboring planters, and also discovered 
that his landing was filled with barges and other small 
craft, such as those from the river plantations, used when 
they went a-visiting one another. ^ 

“There must be something in the wind,” said Capt. 
Paul. 

. “You bet!” averred Alec, his eyes brightening at the 
prospect of excitement. “A lot o’ niggers have run 
away, I reckon, an’ the planters have come to get you 
to tell ’em what to do. Whenever anythin’ goes wrong, 
up or down the river, it’s Capt. Paul they look to.” 

The sight of the sloop, sweeping in toward the land¬ 
ing, caused the crowd to break up and scatter along the 
wharf, waving hats and kerchiefs. 

Foremost of them all was the young planter’s brave 
and efficient overseer, the Highlander, Duncan Macbean. 

The Scotchman’s dress was ordinary plantation garb, 
save as to his headgear, for he was topped with a High¬ 
land bonnet. 

He waved the bonnet and shouted a cheery greeting. 

His words were taken up by others in the crowd. 

“Here’s Capt. Paul back again!” 

“Bravo, Capt. Paul! Sure, he couldn’t have come at a 
more opporchune time.” 

“It’s glad we are to see ye back, lad!” 

“Huzza for the captain! Huzza!” 

There was no room, just then, for the sloop at her 
usual moorings, so the young captain had sail ..taken in

and anchor dropped a cable’s length off the landing; then 
the gig was lowered away, and he got into it with Alec, 
Cato and Scip, and was quickly ashore. 

Old Duncan grabbed his hand fervently as he sprang 
from the boat, his honest, weather-beaten face aglow with 
happiness. 

“Lpsh, man!” cried Duncan, “it’s gude to press your 
hand again! We’ve heard o’ your luck, but fine I knew 
ye’d succeed when ye left the plantation.” 

“What’s the‘matter here, Duncan?” inquired the young 
planter, curiously. “Why have so many of my neighbors 
come together in this fashion?” 

“Hoot, lad, there’s rare mischief afoot. Come up by 

0 

the warehouse and ye’ll learn it all sune enough, I prom¬ 
ise ye.” 

The next moment the youth was fairly surrounded by 
some of the crowd and almost carried to the vicinity of 
the warehouse, where the rest of the throng was waiting. 


CHAPTER IV. 

THE YOUNG PLANTER’S DEFIANCE. 

In die crowd were Bob Tichenor, from across the 
river; Nathan Kaggs, Samuel Swallow, James Ludwell 
and Morris Stringham from up the stream, and Messrs. 
Hapwell, Bruton, and brave Terence O’Malley, from be¬ 
low; there were others, also, from the country to the 
south.' 

Although, at this time, Capt. Paul had been less than 
two years in Virginia, yet he made friends easily, and was 
popular with all the planters in the vicinity of the Rappa¬ 
hannock. ' 

He was a dashing young spark, loved his adopted coun¬ 
try with all his heart and soul, and was ready, at all times, 
with his Sword or his fists to avenge a personal affront or 
give aid to a friend. 

Among the planters there were king’s men as well as 
patriots, but enmity between the two factions was not yet 
so open and bitter as at a later period. 

Paul Jones was a red-hot Whig, and was proud of it. 

Not only did he proclaim just what he was, so there 
could be no possible doubt on the subject, but he made 
no secret of his affiliations with Washington, Henry, and 
die rest of the patriot clique. 

Samuel Swallow, from up the river, was the most in¬ 
veterate Tory of any of the king’s men that day . assem¬ 
bled at Capt. Paul’s plantation. 


Master Swallow was as round as a rum cask, had 
very red face and a much redder nose, wore a ten-po^ 
wig, dressed in cherry-colored silk, gave the latest ^ 
to his hat, and strutted as he walked. 

He was cordially disliked even by the Tories. Wb- 
ever there was anything of importance going forward, 
always tried to make himself the leader. 

He sat on a bench by the warehouse taking snuff 
a gold box as the young captain drew near, surround, 
by O’Malley, Ludwell and a few of the younger set. 

Snapping shut the lid of the snuffbox, Master Sw 
low floundered to his feet and leaned heavily on his cai 

“An’ it please you, Capt. Jones,” he puffed, “we, y< 
neighbors, have assembled here this morning to take coi 
sel concerning a number of outrages that have been per 
trated on our plantations.” 

Master Swallow waved his right hand pompously, a 
thrust it into his ruffled bosom. 

A laugh went up from O’Malley and others. 

Young Alec Gilpin was standing behind Master Sw 
low, his nose in the air, leaning on a stick, which he h 
in his left hand, and his other hand thrust gracefully i 
the breast of his leather jacket. 

Every move made by the fat Tory was perfectly mi 
icked by Alec; even the coonskin cap which the boy w< 
was cocked over-his left eye. 

The effect was ridiculous, to say the least. 

Failing to grasp the cause of the laughter. Mast 
Swallow glared indignantly. 

“This, gentlemen,” he cried, pounding the ground wi 
his cane, “is no time for levity! I am astonished tl 
you should treat the matter in that way. We must mi 
the issue courageously—courageously, I repeat,, or tl 
organized band of robbers will leave us without, hot 
and home.” 

He withdrew his hand from among the ruffles a 
stroked his chin. 

Alec had also thumped the earth with his stick, raisj 
his eyebrows and began stroking his chin. 

The boy’s face was gravity itself, and the laught 
increased. 

Master Swallow’s wrath continued to rise. 

* 

All at once he glanced around and saw Alec. 

“You—you little imp of the archfiend!” puffed. Sw» 
low. “How dare you, you young scalawag, make spc 
of your betters ? I’ll cane ye, by gad!” 

.Flourishing his cane, the Tory.,started for Alec, to 




PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Elected to take account of the bench that was between 
to and the boy. 

Stumbling over the bench. Master Swallow went down 
a heap, his fat legs thrashing the air. 

In some way he got on his back, and was as helpless 
that position as a turtle. 

“Faith,” laughed O’Malley, “these king’s men are 
lie good when ye have their backs to our good Vir- 
lia soil. Steady away, Master Swallow! Don’t be so 
:e with your cane, but give us your hand.” 

Capt. Paul and O’Malley, taking the fat gentleman’s 
nd on either side, lifted him to his feet. 

Ludwell picked up the three-corned hat and placed it 
the big wig. 

“Gad!” fumed Swallow, his face purple with rage, “I 
In’t come here to be insulted.” 

“Alec,” said Capt. Paul, repressing his merriment with 
ficulty and trying to be stem, “you should pay more 
ipect to Master Swallow. Beg his pardon, lad, for 
ur apish tricks!” 

^.lec was all humility as he came closer to the Tory. 
“Forgive me, sir,” said he. “I was but trying to leam 
jir-polished manner, which is the talk of all Virginia. 
\ give my eyeteeth, sir, an’ I was as courtly and grace- 

; 99 

Swallow was as proud as a peacock. He wanted to 
considered the Beau Brummel of the Colony, and was 
ft enough to take Alec’s flattery in sober earnest. 

“Ha!” he cried, casting a look at the planters about 
'em, “even the young are quick to appreciate the courtly 
aces!” Then, placing a fat hand on Alec’s head, he 
ent on: “Ye do well, lad, to imitate those who, by 
Itural study and aptitude, have made themselves the 
ass of fashion and the mold of form.” 

1 O’Malley snickered behind his hand, and all the others 
id to turn their heads to hide their smiles or their dis- 
|st ■ 

Alex continued to be meek and humble. Reaching into 
is breeches pocket he brought out an old horn snuffbox, 
“Allow me, sir!” he said, presenting the box to Swal- 
fw with a flourish and a bow. 

“Bravo!” cried Swallow. “But you can improve on 
pat, lad. Try it once more—like this.” 

And Swallow pulled out his own box, swept it through 
ie- air, and bowed with his hat against his ruffles. 

'Alec copied the maneuver, and Master Swallow gra¬ 


ciously accepted the old horn box and took a liberal pinch 
of its contents in each nostril. . . 

Then Alec, with astonishing alacrity, started for the 
woods. 

“Pepper!” he yelled, between bursts of impish laughter. 

The Tory fairly bellowed in his wrath. 

With all his might he hurled the horn box after the 
prankish lad, then fell to sneezing and coughing until the 
tears rolled down his cheeks, his hat flew off, his wig 
came awry and he tumbled back on the bench. 

“I’ll—I’ll”—sneeze—“have that”—sneeze—“young 
ne’er-do-well at the”—sneeze, sneeze—“whipping-post 
for this!” 

When he recovered a little, he got on his feet and 
sneezed out a call for his blacks. 

When they came, he sneezed himself down to the land¬ 
ing, sneezed himself into the boat, and went sneezing up 
the river. 

“Fiend take me,” said O’Malley, leaning against the 
warehouse and laughing till he cried, “our Tory friend 
has sneezed more in the last five minutes than he has in 
a whole twelvemonth back!” ' 

When the planters had somewhat recovered from their 
mirth, Capt. Paul asked to know the purpose of the 
meeting. 

“Our plantations are being harried by a gang of rob¬ 
bers, Capt. Paul,” said Morris Stringham. “Everyone 
here has suffered, more or less. Plate and money have 
been stolen from my house.” 

“A hogshead of winter-cured was taken from my ware¬ 
house,” spoke up James Ludwell, “and one of my blacks, 
who heard the marauders and tried to stop them, was 
Shot and killed.” 

“And I,” said Bruton, “found a writing pinned to my 
door saying that if I did not leave a hundred gold guineas 
at the foot of the Black Rock on St. Swithin’s Day, one 
of my tobacco houses would be fired. And if the money 
was not left at the rock on the day following, the other 
house would be burned.” 

“Did you leave the money. Master Bruton?” inquired 
Capt. Paul. 

“Not on the first call.” 

“And one of your tobacco houses was burned ?” 

“Ay, to the ground. Next day I left the money, and 
t’other house was spared.” 

“I, also, have lost tobacco,” reported Hapwell, “as well 
as Indian corn.” 



Id 


PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


“And, by the same token,” put in O’Malley, “the black¬ 
guards raided my place and took away a pair of fine 
flintlocks and a supply of powder and ball.” 

All had had their say save Duncan Macbean. Capt. 
Paul looked at him. 

“Hdith, captain,” said Duncan, “we’ve lost nothing as 
yet, but yesterday morning, as I came frae the house, I 
found this arrow athwart the step.” 

■ An Indian arrow, crosswise of the threshold, meant 
war. 

Capt. Paul took the arrow, as the overseer handed 
it over, and snapped it in half. 

“And on the house door,” proceeded Duncan, taking 
a folded paper from the crown of his bonnet, “I found 
this;” 

Capt. Paul read the paper. 

“Capt. Paul Jones will leave five hundred golden 
guineas at the Black Rock on Tuesday night, or his ware¬ 
house will be burnt; an’ he leaves not the guineas the day 
following, his grist mill follows the warehouse. 

(Signed) “Old Truepenny Tyburn.” 

Every eye was on the young planter. 

With a disdainful laugh he tore the note in pieces, and 
cast the pieces to the winds. 

“What answer, captain ?” asked Duncan, surveying the 
other planters with a proud smile on his grizzled face. 

“Go to the slave quarters, Duncan,” said Capt. Paul, 
“and find me a rattlesnake skin. Bring with it a horn 
of powder and a bullet pouch.” 

The work was quickly performed ; then Capt. Paul 
pushed the broken arrow into the snakeskin and packed 
it round with powder and ball. 

“There, Duncan,” said he, handing the stuffed snake- 
skin to the overseer, “when Old Truepenny comes to the 
Black Rock to-night hunting his golden guineas, let him 
find that.” ’ ' ' 

Duncan Macbean was never prouder of the young 
planter than he was at that moment. 

“Old Truepenny has a man o’ parts to deal wi’ now, 
ye ken!” he exclaimed, broadly, to the planters. 

“ZoOks, lad!” cried Bruton, “ye’ll lose your ware¬ 
house and mill, e’en as I lost my tobacco house.” 

“Let Ole Truepenny try his tricks here,” answered 
Capt. Paul, “and hell have an ounce ball in his robber’s 
heart 1 Tell me, has nothing been done to bring these 
thieves to book ?” 

“Much, captain,” said O’Malley; “but to no avail. 


Sure, we’ve followed their trail with the dogs, but 
trail vanishes into the water and the dogs are at sea.” 

“Neighbors,” said Capt. Paul, “this work is to my 
ing. Since I am sending Old Truepenny my defiance, 
is fair to suppose that my plantation will be his field 
operations for the next few days, so the rest of you nf 
feel secure. 

“I give you my promise that I will lay him and his c 
throat crew' by the heels and rid the Rappahannock 
them for all time.” 

“Will ye need help, my lad ?” asked Terence O’Malk 

“An’ I do,” replied Capt. Paul. “I have Duncan, aj 
he is a host in himself.” 

Caesar approached at that moment. 

“Marse Cap’n,” said he, “dere’s a coach at de do 
o’ de mansion an’ a lady askin’ for Marse Paul. She $ 
she ’bliged tuh stop, case her mammy done took sick 
de way.” 

Capt. Paul excused himself to the planters a 
started for the house. The planters, having finished t 
business that brought them together, took to their bc« 
and departed for their estates. 

CHAPTER V. 

MIDNIGHT PROWLERS. 

A chariot, drawn by tw r o white horses, was at the sS 
of the house overlooking the highroad. 

The black driver was on the ground, at the head 
the horses, evidently waiting for the master of the ma 
sion to appear. 

Doleful moans were coming from inside the charil 
and Capt. Paul, hat under his arm, stepped to the opjj 
door. 

The young planter, because of his dashing mann| 
ready courage and courtly bearing, was equally popul 
among the lasses of Tidewater Virginia as among t 
lads. 

Within the chariot were two ladies, one young ag 
dressed in dimity, her slippers giving a glimpse of neat 
turned ankles in silken hose, beautifully clocked w? 
fancy designs. 

On her right cheek was a black patch cut in form 
a crescent. Such patches were much worn by ladies 
the day, but this, it seemed to the young planter, & 
overlarge. 

This young lady was as beautiful as anv the you* 
captain had met in the Colonies. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. ir 

fHer companion was middle-aged, and in brocade. much as he did a Lowlander—which is saying a good 


She was being supported by the younger woman, who, 
) the same time, was using a small phial of smelling 
Jts. 

[ “At your service, ladies,” said Capt. Paul, with a low 

tfw. 

“Sir,” returned the younger woman, “I am Miss Betsy 
yonin, of Williamsburg, and this is my mother. We are 
I our way to Samuel Swallow’s plantation, beyond the 
ver, but mother has been taken ill with megrims and we 
fcnnot travel further to-day. If we could find some ref¬ 
ife until to-morrow-” 

“My house, madame, is at your service. There are no 
jmen folk about the place, but I assure you you will be 
3 safe in the home of Capt. Paul Jones as in your own 
Sace at Williamsburg.” 

'The “megrims” was a fashionable complaint of the 
y, and in these times would be referred to as a head- 
*he. 

*If the chariot was bound for Master Swallow’s, be- 
tnd the river, it was somewhat out of its course, as it 
ould have taken a road several miles to the west and 
ossed the Rappahannock at Gilpin’s Ferry. 

i 

The young planter made no comment on this point, 
it called Caesar to take the hand bags, and Cato to help 
je black coachman put up the horses, and then supported 
jame Cronin into the house and upstairs to the best 
iamber. 

Mistress Betsy followed; and when they were safe in 
eir room, Capt. Paul ordered his old housekeeper to 
fend to their wants. 

f 

Duncan Macbean was in the great living room when 
ipt. Paul entered it, after seeing to the comfort of his 
tests. 

“Two ladies are to be with us overnight,” said the 
tung planter. “They are the Cronins, of Williamsburg, 
pther and daughter, and are bound for Master Swal- 

S. 

“Tories!” growled Duncan Macbean. 

He had fought with the redcoats under Braddock, and 
id been in at Braddock’s defeat when, but for Wash- 
gton, every redcoat and provincial would have bit 
e dust. 

Washington had been despised by the regular British- 
s, and his advice, had not been taken. 

Macbean could not forget this, and he hated a Tory as 


deal. 

“Why,” he demanded, “are they near this plantation if 
they are bound for Samuel Swallow’s?” 

“ ’Twere impolite to inquiry Duncan,” smiled Capt. 
Paul. “They are here for the night, and are to be well 
cared for. The elder lady is ill, but to-morrow they will 
go on to Master Swallow’s.” 

Stepping to the great fireplace, the young planter ran 
his fingers over the front of the blue tiles. 

Suddenly the fingers paused, pressed upon a certain 
spot, and the face of one of the tiles swung noiselessly 
outward, revealing a small aperture behind it. 

“You know of this place, Duncan,” said Capt. Paul. 
“Many a time I have stored valuable papers in this place. 
Look!” 

The youth drew the little ebony box from his breast and 
held it up for the Highlander’s inspection. 

“I see, lad,” said the overseer. 

“This is to be guarded with your life, if necessary, 
Duncan,” went on Capt. Paul, placing the box in the 
hiding place and pushing the tile shut. “It is-” 

The overseer sprang up hastily, approached a hall door 
with catlike softness and flung it quickly open. 

After looking about the hall for a space, he reclosed 
the door and came back to his young master’s side. 

“What is it?” queried the youth. 

“I thought I heard a noise,” replied Duncan. 

“There is no one in the house save you and I, the 
housekeeper and the two ladies above stairs* 

“Natheless I thought I heard some one at the door,” 
insisted Duncan. 

“But you did not?” 

“I saw no one, lad. But the box. Ye say it is to be 
guarded? We must be watchfu’ concernin’ it?” 

“Ay! for the good of the Colonies, Duncan. You are 
as much a patriot as I am. If these thieves, who are 
prowling about the plantations, should come upon us, do 
you guard the fireplace and leave me to attend to the 
marauders.” 

“Ay, lad, that I will.” 

“And if anything should happen to me, that box is 
to be given over to the man who calls for it with a letter 
from Mr. Adams; an’ he be the right man, he will have 
a key to fit the box, which you will have him' open before 
you.” ■ 

“Should evil befall ye, I’ll haud fast to the box till the

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


right man comes, but ye are no in much danger from these 
night prowlers, I’m thinkin’.” 

“Still,” said Paul, “ ’tis best to be on the safe side. 
Have you had my defiance taken to Old Truepenny?” . 

“It has gone to the Black Rock; fjcip took it.” 

“Alec has some powder aboard the sloop. Let him 
have the barge, with Cato and enough blacks to man it, 
to take the powder upriver to his father, at the ferry.” 

“Ay, sir.” 

“And post guards at the warehouse, night and day. I 
hope Old Truepenny and his rascals will come. An’ 
they do, Duncan; I can pick up their trail with the dogs.” 

“I will take care to guard against fire, captain.” 

Duncan left soon after receiving his instructions, and 
the young planter, filling the bowl of a “churchwarden” 
from a jar of tobacco on a table, settled himself by a 
window to smoke and reflect. 

While* he was never happier than when actively" en¬ 
gaged in some such work as trailing down this band 
of freebooters, he liked it little that such work should 
come upon him at the very time he was taking care of 
the ebony box. 

But with the active aid of brave old Duncan he had 
little doubt of his ability to acquit himself well of both 
duties. 

He hoped, as he sat there smoking, that Mistress Betsy 
Cronin would favor him with a glimpse of herself and 
a brief chat; but she did not. 

Instead, the housekeeper came to announce that Dame 
Cronin was still too ill to leave her chamber, or allow 
her daughter to leave. If it pleased the master of the 
house, they would like their meals in their room. 3 

The young captain gave orders in accordance with this 
request. 

The afternoon he spent on horseback, riding over the 
estate with the overseer. 

The ladies sent down another excuse, and their even¬ 
ing meal, like their dinner, was sent up to them. 

Duncan had made some attempt at quizzing the black 
who had driven the chariot to the door, but the 'slave 
might as well have been deaf and dumb so far as any¬ 
thing could be learned of hint. 

Following supper, Duncan was posted in the living 
room. 

A conch covered with deerskins was to be his bed for 
the night, and there -was a tankard of bombo for’his use 
set out on the table. 


The overseer, as the saying is, slept always withi 
eye open. The slightest noise would waken him out( 
soun^L slumber. 

As for the young planter, he went to the wareho 
where Scip and Cato were watching. 

These black boys were particular favorites with ti 
master because of their courage and faithfulness. 

They were armed with firelocks, and, in addition,! 
cutlasses at their sides. 

The sloop had been moored at her old berth, against t* 
landing and opposite the warehouse. 

Capt. Paul sprang to her silent deck and groped 
way down the companion and into the after cabin. 

Life ashore was never much to his mind; what' 
loved was a heaving deck under his feet, and but for 
sloop, which had come to him with the plantation, 
could hardly have contented himself on his estate. 

In the cabin, he was close enough to the warehotj 
to be of assistance if needed, and, without striking a ligl 
he stretched himself out in his berth, sword and pist 
within easy reach. 

Dozing in a half slumber, he did not know how ma 
minutes or hours had passed when, abruptly, he starl 
to a sitting posture in his bunk. 

A noise as of a boat rubbing against the sloop’s si 
had reached his ears. 

This was followed by shuffling, catlike steps on t 
deck overhead; and then, a moment later, the slo 
seemed to be in motion—the lap of bilge water indicatii 
that such was the case. 

Noiselessly as he could, Capt. Paul got out of t 
berth, buckled on his sword, grasped his pistols and st< 
up the edmpanion way. 

On the deck, near the companion, a man was standii 

Looking past him, the young planter saw that the slo 
was indeed in motion, heading toward the middle of t 
river, noiselessly" leaving the warehouse astern. 

Scip and Cato, expecting trouble from the landwa 
side of the warehouse, were there. 

If they had not been taken care of by the thieves 
which hardly seemed likely, for that could not have b( 
done without scuffling and an alarm—the sloop was 1 
ing stolen right out from under their noses. 

Stepping with catlike softness to the deck, Capt. Pi 
saw that a tow line had been passed to a rowboat. 1 
sloop’s cables had been cut, and she was being tow 
away into the darkness. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


13 


The man who had come aboard from the river side, 
nd had severed the cables, turned. 

Had he seen a ghost he could not have shown greater 
onsternation than when his eyes encountered the young 
lanter. 

Without allowing him a moment’s time to shout an 
Iarm, Capt. Paul's right fist shot out with the force of a 
attering-ram. 

The fellow staggered and dropped senseless to the 
eck. 

The youth thereupon ran forward, fired at the men 
1 the rowboat, dropped his pistols and cut the tow line 
rith his sword. 

Apparently both Capt. Paul’s shots were effective, 
pr two of the dark figures in the smaller craft sank 
rom sight under the gunwales. 

While the daring youth bent over the tow line, a rifle 
facked, and his hat was turned half around on his head 
jy a bullet. 

Back at the landing Cato and Scip came rushing from 
ie opposite side of the warehouse; and there was a tur- 
loil at the quarters, proving that the slaves were aroused. 
Dogs began barking, and an excited din took the place 
f the recent silence. 

"De sloop!” yelled Cato; “she’s done gwine off into de 
ibber!” 

“Somebody’s done stealin’ de sloop!’’ echoed the frantic 
cip. 

“Dere’s some un aboa’d de sloop!” and the two black 
loys had their guns leveled at Capt. Paul in a twinkling. 

“Steady, there, boys!” shouted Capt. Paul, “The sloop 
yas in tow of a small boat. Run along the bank and see 
f you can pick .off some of the rascals in the boat; don’t 
et them get ashore.” 

The blacks started away, and, at about that time, the 
,tmng planter heard a splash. 

Hastening to the spot where he had felled the man 
1 moment before, he found that the fellow had recovered 
lis wits and vanished—undoubtedly taking to the water. 

Although Capt- Paul looked for him, he was not to be 
seen. 

By then a large number of the blacks had reached the 
anding, 

Capt. Paul hove a rope ashore, and the sloop was soon 
yarped back to her moorings. 

.Springing to the wharf, the young planter asked for 
Duncan Macbean. 


None of the negroes had seen him. 

Knowing Macbean must have heard the noise, and that 
he would have shown himself if able to do so, the youth 
decided to make a hurried call at the house. 

Bidding part of the blacks to watch the sloop, and the 
rest to hurry after Cato and Scip, and give them aid if 
any were needed, Capt. Paul dashed off in the direction 
of the mansion. 

Curtains were drawn at the living-room windows; at 
the edges of the curtains, however, he saw lines of light. 

The windows of the great chamber, above the living 
room, were dark. 

Letting himself in at the great entrance door, Paul 
Jones crept along the hall to the door of the living room. 

It stood a little ajar, giving him a glimpse of the inte¬ 
rior. 

The young woman, Betsy Cronin, was there. 

She was dressed as when she had got out of the car¬ 
riage, with the exception of her hat. 

Carrying a lighted candle, she stood before the fire¬ 
place carefully examining the tiles. 

For a brief space the youug planter was astounded. 

Duncan Macbean was not far wrong when he thought 
he had overheard some one at the door at the time Paul 
had opened the secret cupboard and placed the ebony box 
within it. 

This young woman, a self-confessed Tory, was there 
to obtain the papers intrusted to Paul Jones’ care! 

A suspicion flashed through the young planter’s mind; 
almost at the selfsame moment the suspicion was verified. 

The girl slightly turned her face. 

The black patch had disappeared from the right cheek, 
and there, just as described by the landlord of the cross¬ 
roads ordinary, was the small red scar in the shape of an 
“S.” 

This woman, then, and the woman who had fought 
for the papers on the Williamsburg road, were one and 
the same! 

Paul Jones’ eyes hardened like jade. 

Where was Duncan Macbean ? He swept his eves 
about the room, but was unable to see any trace of the 
overseer. 

Another instant and he had leaped into the apartment. 

“For what are you looking, may I ask?” he inquired, 
dryly. “My guest, I should think, ought to be attending 
her afflicted parent instead of roaming my premises at 
this hour.” ' 




PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


A little cry escaped the woman and she flung back, 
dropping the candle, and one hand darting toward her 
bosom. 

The candle sputtered out harmlessly on the fireplace 
hearth. 

Other, candles blazed in the room, lighting it brightly. 

Betsy Cronin’s eyes blazed fiercely, and she drew from 
her bosom a jeweled dagger. 

“Those papers are concealed here!” she cried, shrilly. 
“I will have them now, traitor! You shall not escape me 
this time, Paul Jones!” 

Then she rushed at him like a wild cat. 

CHAPTER VI. 

AT CLOSE QUARTERS. 

So befouled with contrary winds had been the sloop, 
on her trip from the York to the Rappahannock, that it 
was no difficult matter for the young woman to travel 
at speed ’cross country and reach Paul Jones’ plantation 
at about the same time he did. 

At some point the coafch and four had been exchanged 
for the chariot and the other two horses. 

Determined as this beautiful young vixen certainly 
was, her first thought, after the young planter had escaped 
with his papers, would be to make another play in the 
young planter’s home. 

Again, she had approached the youth on the side of his 
chivalrous nature; but had Paul Jones seen that scar on 
her cheek, or been able to recognize her in any other way, 
he would not have stumbled into this second trap. 

The raging girl, having come within arm’s length of 
him, made a sweeping lunge with the dagger. 

With inconceivable quickness the young captain caught 
her white, slender wrist in a grip of steel. 

A cry of pain was emitted from the woman’s beautiful 
lips, and the dagger fell to the polished floor. 

Pushing her from him, Capt. Paul picked up the dag¬ 
ger. 

“It ill becomes me to use force against a woman,” said 
he, tossing the dagger into a far corner, back of the couch, 
“but when a woman twice attempts my life, I have noth¬ 
ing else for it.” 

Steps were heard outside, and the other woman ap¬ 
peared in the door, wringing her hands. 

"Betsy, Betsy, it is as I feared!” wailed the elder 
woman. "You have failed, and now-” 


“I have not failed!” cried the girl, as a dripping m3 
•pushed past her mother into the room. 

The man was bareheaded, and water dripped from h 
swarthy face. He was fair drenched, and, as he walke 
his feet ground in his soggy jack boots. 

“Ho!” cried Capt. Paul, a light breaking over hii 
“was it you. Skipper Cockle, whom I felled to the da 
of my sloop?” 

“Ay, dash me!” growled Cockle; “and it was I, 1 
the seven holy spritsails, from whom you escaped, in tt 
coach on the Williamsburg road. But this time- 

The scoundrel did not finish, but leaped to the fin 
place. 

Above the mantel were two crossed swords. Cock 
jerked one of these from its. fastenings, swung aroui 
in front of Capt. Paul, and stood at guard. 

His eyes gleamed like those of an enraged panther. 

Capt. Paul had his pistols, but they had been used, an 
he had not taken time to reload them. 

He was beginning to see throifgh this pretty plot mot 
and more clearly. 

It must have been a strange and vital matter that coul 
bring such Tories as the Cronins hand-and-glove wit 
such spawn as Skipper Cockle. 

“Front to front at last!” breathed Cockle. “Split m 
fore an’ aft if I don’t settle our old account by runnio! 
ye through!” 

“Try it an’ welcome,” smiled Capt. Paul, whipping ou 
his blade. 

“Stand back, mistress!” said Cockle, in warning void 
to Betsy Cronin. “Give us room and keep yourself am 
the dame beyond the circle of our swords. King Georg 
will have one rebel the less to fight before we are done; 
Hast got the papers?” 

“Nay,” answered the girl, seizing her mother am 
pressing back, “but I know where they are! Gain th 
mastery of Capt. Jones, friend Cockle, and we shall ven 
soon have the papers! Hast secured the sloop so tha 
we may sail in her?” 

Cockle started an oath, but bit the words short 

“The sloop cannot be taken! An’ we fly, it must b 
in the chariot.” 

"Guard!” cried Capt. Paul, and leaped at the man. 

With a moan, Dame Cronin sank down in a chair aw 
buried her face in her hands. Her daughter was not si 
squeamish, but stood erect, watching the combat wit] 
steady eyes. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


With the sword, Capt. Paul had no superior in the 
Colonies. He was lighter on his feet, had a truer hand 
and a quicker eye than Cockle, and knew that he could 
best him. 

Besides, he had but to raise his voice and his slaves 
would come. 

Cockle, knowing Capt. Paul’s love of fair play, felt 
sure he would not do this. 

The skipper’s aim was to slay his antagonist and then 
slip away from the mansion before the deed was dis¬ 
covered. 

It was desperate, but Cockle had taken desperate 
chances all his life long. 

The swords circled like strips of fire in the candlelight, 
and the musical clash of s + ; a l against steel echoed through 
the room. 

Cockle’s inferiority was apparent from the very first, 
and the girl, suddenly throwing a footstool, endeavored 
to trip his, adversary and place him at the skipper’s 
“mercy. 

“Another attempt like that,” said Capt. Paul, “and I 
“will call my blacks. I am giving this blackguard a fair 
■khow for his skill, but you may tempt me to do other- 

* 99 

wise. 

The girl drew back, pallid and breathless. 

Step by step Capt. Paul forced Cockle backward around 
the room, playing with him as a cat might play with a 
mouse. 

'The skipper panted and swore, lunging madly and 
leaving his breast unguarded a score of times. 

Suddenly he tripped against the couch, pushed it back¬ 
ward and its covering of deerskins revealed the form 
of Duncan Macbean, lying at full length on the floor. 

The unexpected sight so unnerved Capt. Paul that a 
quick lunge oh the part of Cockle rent his coat and came 
within an inch of piercing his breast. 

The girl clapped her hands. 

“Another like that, friend Cockle! Another!” 

A fair fiend she was, or else her zeal in the interest of 
the king had robbed her of every womanly feeling. 

Capt. Paul, enraged at the sight of Duncan Macbean’s 
silent form, was all for passing his blade through the 
murderous skipper’s heart. 

He pressed the skipper harder and harder, and finally 
had him against the wall. 

* Just then swift steps echoed from the hall, and a door 
opened at the young planter’s back. 


He did not look around, not daring to take his eyes 
from the vengeful Cockle in such a critical moment. 

“Capture the women, lads!” he shouted, thinking -the 
newcomers must be his blacks; “leave this rascal to 
me-” 

Before he could finish a fierce blow was dealt from 
behind. 

Capt. Paul dropped his sword, threw up his hands 
and staggered back. 

Half dazed, he saw a man with a bandaged head stand¬ 
ing before him; and simultaneously he heard his negroes 
hastening toward the house outside. 

Again the man-o’-war’s man used his flinty fist, and 
Paul Jones fell backward across the cot. 


CHAPTER VII. 

PURSUIT. 

When Capt. Paul regained his wits, his aged house¬ 
keeper was in the room directing the negroes who were 
laboring to resuscitate him. 

French brandy had been forced between his lips and 
water dashed in his face. 

He sat up on the cot, stunned and bewildered, trying 
to remember what had taken place. 

“Is yo’ all right, Marse Cap’nr” 

“Does yo’ feel better, Marse Paul ?” 

Paul Jones, like his brother, William, before him, was 
a kind and considerate master. 

He was almost worshiped by his slaves, several of 
whom he had manumitted in recognition of some brave 
act. 

Presently he started up, poured himself another draught 
of brandy and tossed it off. 

“Where are those who were in this room when you 
came?” he asked of Cato. 

“Der wasn’t no one heah, Marse Cap’n,” replied 
Cato; “jess you and Marse Duncan, on de flo’ dere.” 

“Run to the barn, Cato, and see if the chariot that 
brought the visitors to the mansion is still here,” said 
the young planter, feverishly energetic as a full realiza¬ 
tion of events returned to him. “Scip,” he added, “ran 
upstairs and see if those two ladies are in their room/’ 

The two black boys hurried out of the room, and their 
master sank on his knees beside Duncan Macbean. 

To his surprise, there was no wound upon the over¬ 
seer’s body. • * ' 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


16 

He was breathing heavily, and was more like a man 
in a trance than in a natural sleep. 

His breath carried an odor that caused the youth to 
start and give vent to a muttered exclamation. 

“Lift him to the couch,” he ordered, and arose and 
went to the table. 

Lifting the goblet that stood near the tankard, he 
smelled of it and detected the same odor that hung so 
heavily on the overseer’s breath. 

“Drugged!” he muttered. 

It was the young woman who had done this; it could 
have been no other. 

In some way she had succeeded in slipping a sleeping 
potion into the overseer’s liquor, and he had drained the 
goblet without suspecting. 

When drowsiness overtook him, the girl had entered 
the room, dragged his form to the couch and concealed 
it, and then had taken the candle and begun her examina¬ 
tion of the tiles. 

As he thought of the tiles and the ebony box, Capt. 
Paul’s eyes sought the fireplace. 

Another surprise was in store for him. 

The tile that covered the secret compartment swung 
open! 

With a cry of dismay he leaped to the fireplace and 
thrust his hand into the aperture. 

The box was gone! 

Overcome by the discovery, the young planter dropped 
limply into a chair. 

The trust reposed in him by Col. Washington, Patrick 
Henry and his good friend, Mr. Hewes, had been mis¬ 
placed ! 

The papers were gone, and the Tories, through this 
desperate and determined young woman, had dealt a tell¬ 
ing blow at their enemies, the patriots. 

The same spirit that cropped out in Capt. Paul when, 
later, he stood on his battered and sinking ship and called 
out: “We have just begun to fight 1 ” froze in him then. 

Quickly he had marshaled his wits and was on his feet 
once more. 

“Cassar,” said he, “you and Juba will take the skiff 
and cross the river after Bob Tichenor. Bring him at 
once and have him do what he can for Duncan.” 

As the negroes went out, Cato came in from the barn. 

“De charyut is gone, Marse Cap’n,” he reported, “an’ 
dat strange niggah is gone wif it” 


On the heels of this came Scip with the announce 
ment: 

“Dem ladies ain’t upstairs no mo’, Marse Cap’n; dej, 
clean gone.” 

“Get my riding horse, Neb,” Capt. Paul ordere 
“Bring a torch with you and hold the horse till I come 1 

He turned to Scip and Cato again. 

“Load my pistols, Cato,” he went on, handing tl 
weapons to the black. “Now, Scip,” he ordered, wh« 
Cato had left, “didn’t you and Cato hear those rasca 
when they came and made fast to the sloop?” 

“We didn’t heah a sound, Marse Cap’n,” protest* 
Scip; “fust thing we heah was de shootin’.” 

“What about the men in the boat?” ■ 

“We kep’ ’em from landin’, sah. Dey pulled off up i 
ribber. When dey was gone, we sta’ted to look fo’ yc 
Couldn’t see yo’ nowhere, so we come to de house. »1 
front do’ was wide open, an’ when we reached dishyet 
room, Marse Duncan was on de flo’ an' you was er lvir 
’crost de couch. Dar wasn’t no one else heah.” 

“You didn’t hear anyone running, or hear the charie 
drive away?” 

“No, Marse Cap’n.” 

Cato came back with the loaded revolvers. 

Capt. Paul took his naked sword from the table, wbei 
one of the negroes had laid it, and slipped it into th 
scabbard. 

Then he took his pistols from Cato and thrust theo 
into his sword belt. 

Picking up his spurs from the mantel, he buckled -the 
to his heels. 

“Scip,” he went on, when ready to start, “you an: 
Cato will take half a dozen of the other boys with ya 
and go to the sloop. Stay right with her and watch hi 
until further orders.” 

“Is yo’ goin’ alone aftah dat charyut, Marse Cap’n 
inquired Scip. 

“Certainly.” 

“Kain’t ye take me ’long, Marse Cap’n? ’Tain’t rig 
fo’ you to go alone, sah!” 

“Do as I tell you!” answered Capt. Paul, and hurri* 
from the house. 

Down by the horse-block stood Neb with the horse an 
the torch. 

Taking the torch out of the black’s hand, the youn 
planter held it low and swept it back and forth across ti 
road. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Neb was wise in all the arts of tracking runaway 
aves; he could follow a trail like a bloodhound, and 
rery twig, leaf and blade of grass along the course told 
5 own story of the feet that had passed over it. 
“Look, Neb!” Capt. Paul said, indicating the road. 
vVhat do you see there?” 

“Dere’s prints ob horses an’ a kerridge goin’ east, Marse 
ap’n,” answered Neb, sagaciously, “an’ prints ob de 
ime horses an’ kerridge goin’ west.” 

“The prints pointing west were made after those go- 
,g the other way?” 

“Yass, sah; dat’s whut I makes out.” 

“That is what I make out, too.” 

Capt. Paul leaped to the saddle, his spurs rattled and 

l 

; was off at speed, pointing due west. 

Old Truepenny Tyburn, it now seemed very certain, 
as assisting Skipper Cockle. 

Old Truepenny and his bandits were to steal the sloop 
id have her ready for Dame Cronin and her daughter, 
id the skipper and man-o’-war’s man when they had 
icured the papers and were ready for flight. 

Capt. Paul’s prompt and resolute work had prevented 
te carrying out of that part of the plan. 

The women and their helpers had perforce to fall back 
m the chariot,, which Capt. Paul was pursuing at top 
peed. 

Capt. Paul would have given much to know how Cockle 
and Old Truepenny had been able to unite their forces 
o opportunely. 

: But the business that concerned Capt. .Paul at that 
ime was the overhauling of the chariot and the recovery 
if the ebony box. 

For well-nigh an hour he rode, goading his horse to 
he utmost. At the end of that time he heard the rattle 
if a vehicle ahead. 

He knew he was drawing close to his quarry, and 
vas soon able to see chariot, horses and driver. 

The driver was plying the lash and forcing the horses 
:o their best pace. Presently Capt. Paul was abreast of 
be negro, covering him with a pistol. 

“Stop!” he ordered; “stop at once or I’ll shoot you off 
he seat 1” 

“Doan’ shoot, marse, doan’ shoot 1” implored the negro. 
In pursuing the chariot alone, the young captain was 
icting with his usual impetuosity. 

As he believed, the two women were in the vehicle, 
and also Cockle and the man-o’-war’s man. 


Counting the black driver, he was one against three— 
one against four, if Betsy Cronin were counted. 

As the chariot halted, Capt. Paul backed his horse about 
and faced the door, pistols in hand. 

* Not a sound came from the interior of the vehicle. 

“Who’s in the coach ?” the young planter demanded. 

“No one, marse,” answered the driver. 

“What 1” exclaimed Capt. Paul. “Where are your mis- 
tress and her daughter?” 

“I dunno, marse,” answered the negro, vacantly. 

Suspecting another trap, the young planter dismounted 
, and cautiously opened the chariot door, holding one of 
his pistols in readiness for instant use. 

Still no hostile move against him was made. 

Getting into the vehicle, he found that the driver had 
told the truth, and that it was indeed empty. 

“Where are your passengers?” he demanded, spring¬ 
ing out. 

“I dunno, marse,” repeated the negro. 

“You do know, you black rascal!” cried Capt. Paul, 
leveling one of his weapons. “Is your life worth any¬ 
thing? If it is, you will answer me at once, and tell the 
truth.” 

“You can kill me, marse,” said the negro, “but I kain’t 
tell yo’ somethin’ I doan’ know.” 

After a moment’s thought, Capt. Paul thrust the pistol 
back into his belt. 

“Turn the chariot around,” said he, curtly, “and drive 
back to the plantation.” 

The negro obeyed, but not with a very good grace, 
and together they returned to the place from whence 
they had started. 

It was a silent and far from pleasant journey for either 
of them. 

Dawn was breaking as they drew up in the road in 
front of the mansion. 

Caesar, Juba, Neb and several more of the watchful 
negroes witnessed their approach and hurried up from 
the quarters. 

Capt. Paul told the blacks to put the horses back in 
the bam and to make a prisoner of the negro driver. 

Then he went to the house. 

Bob Tichenor, who had some skill in the practice of 
medicine, was there, doing what he could for Duncan 
Macbean. 

Duncan was still unconscious. 

“Some strange narcotic has been used,” remarked 



i8 


PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Tichenor, “and I am not able to say how long this state 
of coma will last. Macbean may recover in a few min¬ 
utes, and it may be several hours. I have done all I 
can for him, and the only thing to ,do now is to wait until 
the drug has spent itself.” 

Tichenor put on his hat and took his box of phials and 
physic under his arm. 

“You had trouble here last night, I am told,” he went 
on, “but managed to beat off the invaders.” 

“Yes, Bob," Capt. Paul answered, “old Truepenny and 
his crew tried to steal my sloop, and we all had a braw 
time of it.” 

“How did this happen to Duncan, Jack? Surely 
Truepenny isn’t waging his campaign with sleep pow¬ 
ders !” 

“What happened to Duncan is a mystery to me. I 
hope he will recover soon, so that I may know.” 

The young planter was quiet on the subject of the 
stolen papers. Tichenor was a good Whig and a good 
friend, but the fate of the papers Capt. Paul was de¬ 
termined to keep to himself. 

Tichenor went away and Capt. Paul ate his breakfast. 
It was a gloomy breakfast, since brave old Duncan, who 
usually ate with him, was stretched on his back uncon¬ 
scious of all that took place. 

Following the meal, Capt. Paul walked out into the 
sunshine. 

••• “Scip,” he called, “fetch me the strange negro. Have 
Juba come with you, and bring the cat.” 

"'he black was brought struggling to the scene, and 
fald in front of the young planter. 

/ Capt. Paul’s brow was black as a thundercloud. 

“I am positive you know where your mistress went,” 
said he, “and that it was a part of your plan to make me 
lose time following the empty chariot while those I wanted 
were making their escape in another way. 

“You must tell me what became of your mistress. If 
you do not tell me of your own free will, I shall flog you 
until you do.” 

“I dunno huffin’ ’bout it, marse,” insisted the negro. 

“Strip his back,” ordered Capt. Paul, “and take him to 
the whipping-post.” 

CHAPTER VIII. 

ALEC BRINGS ' NEWS. ‘ 

The young planter was not in love with the whipping¬ 
post, and it was rarely brought into- use on his planta¬ 
tion. 


He could be stern enough when occasion derma 
and so could Duncan, but they so ruled the blacks 
extreme measures were rarely called for. 

From the other planters slaves were continually, 
ning away, but never from Capt. Paul. 

In the present instance, Capt. Paul felt that he 
entirely justified. 

So much hung on the recovery of the ebony box 
he -would be lax in the duty he owed his country did 
not exhaust every means for apprehending those ■ 
had stolen it. 

The negro, Juba, was an immense fellow, and muss 
like an ox. 

When the Cronin slave was bound to the post, J 
cast aside his dowlas shirt, grasped the handle of the 
and stepped to the side of the^black who was to ree 
punishment. 

“Your name?” said Capt. Paul, placing himself in fr 
of the Cronin negro, where he could watch his fact 

“Hugon, marse.” 

“You are French?” 

“Oui —from Guiana, marse.” 

“Will you tell what became of your mistress?” 

“I dunno, marse.” 

Hugon’s face had turned a sickly gray under its bla 
skin. Capt. Paul raised his hand. 

The cat swished through the air and fell on the nak 
back. An ear-splitting yell came from Hugon. 

“I don’t Want to punish you more than necessary,” s; 
Capt. Paul. . “You have a chance to tell me where yq 
mistress went, Hugon, and there jyill be no mo 
flogging.” 

Hugon’s face was writhing with pain, but still he ga 
his stereotyped answer: 

“I dunno, marse.” 

Again Capt. Paul raised hi$ hand, and again Juba la 
on with the stinging thongs. Five times in quick so 
cession the cat descended; and then, unable to stand t! 
punishment longer, Hugon cried that he would yield. 

Juba drew aside, holding the cat ready”to use on 
more if it should be needed. 

“Did your mistress and her daughter get into t 
chariot at all ?” asked the young planter. 

“Yass, marse; dey come from de house an’’ got into' 
charyut.” 

“How' far did they ride?” 

“Jess a li’l ways, marse; not mo’ dan er mile.” 



19 


PAUL. 'JONES WEEKLY. 


i“What became of them then ?” 

“Dey all got out-” - 

“Who do you mean by all?" 

:“Marse Cockle an’ dat sailor man wif de bandaged 
tid. Dey was wif mah missis, marse.” 

“Where did they go?” 

“Dey went to take a boat on de ribber.” 

(“Where were they going then?” 

“Up ribber some’rs. I dunno where, marse; hones’ 
don’t.” 

“You were driving that coach on the Williamsburg 
ad?” 

“Yass, marse.” 

“Where were you going that night?” 

“We had be’n out to Marse Cronin’s country place, 
1’ stopped at de tavern on de way back.” 

“Then the sailor came?” 

“Dat’s right, marse. De sailor man come, an’ we 
a’ted; den we was stopped, den you rode up, an’ so 
uch happened I was clean flabbergasted so I couldn’t 
membah nuffin’.” 

“What happened after the fight?” 

“I was told to drive back to Marse Cronin’s country 
ace, where we got de charyut an’ anodder team, an’ 
ime on heah.’’ 

“Was Cockle hurt during that fight we had in the 
bach?” 

Capt. Paul recalled that Mistress Betsy had used the 
evolver that time, and that Cockle had cried out as 
vith the pain of a wound. 

“Jess a li’l’ hurt, marse,” said Hugon; “in de side, 
)ut it doan’ amount to nuffin’.” 

Capt. Paul had learned all that he cared to know. 

The Cronins, Cockle and the man-o’-war’s man had 
gone upriver, and he had no time to lose if he cherished 
any hopes of. overhauling them. 

He gave orders that Hugon was to be untied from the 
post, conveyed to the quarters and tenderly cared for; 1 
hut he was to be kept a prisoner. 

Neb was sent again for his master's riding horse, and 
the youth went again into the house for a final look at 
poor Duncan before leaving the plantation. 

The overseer was lying just as he had been, not a 
flicker of returning consciousness showing in his immo¬ 
bile face. 

With a sigh the young captain turned away, left the 


house, swung into the saddle and spurred along the bridle 
path that followed the river. 

Never was the young planter’s iron endurance better 
exemplified than in this series of exciting adventures. 

He had had no rest during the preceding night saving 
the brief interval he had passed in his berth on the sloop, 
and for hours he had been actively engaged. 

Notwithstanding this, his hardy nature leaped un- 
weariedly to meet what fate might have in store for 
him. 

His nerves were steady, his faculties keen and he was 
in fine trim to do his best whenever he should be called 
upon. 

As he rode upstream, he came presently to a stretch 
of sandy shore with a huge black bowlder in the middle 
of it. 

“The Black Rock!” he muttered, thinking of what had 
taken place at his plantation on the forenoon of the 
preceding day. 

The empty rattlesnake skin lay over the face of the 
bowlder, and to it was attached a bit of paper bearing 
these words: 

“Old Truepenny presents, his compliments to Capt. Paul 
Jones and wishes to state that he accepts the powder and 
ball as a loan, and will return them to Capt. Jones at the 
muzzle of a flintlock. Tidewater, Virginia, is not large 
enough for both Capt. Jones and old Truepenny Ty¬ 
burn.” 

A grim smile curled Capt. Paul’s lip. 

“Old Truepenny is a rare rogue,” thought he, as he 
started on. “I’ faith I should like to meet him.” 

While the young planter was threading the thick woods 
a mile further, his quick ears caught a thud of galloping 
hoofs. Backing his mount into the undergrowth, the 
youth waited, one hand on the butt of a pistol. 

The next moment an exclamation of surprise escaped 
him, for the approaching rider was none other than Alec 
Gilpin. 

The lad was lying along his horse’s neck, plying the 
gad and riding like mad. 

“Alec!” called Capt. Paul. 

“Hello!” returned Alec, straightening up and stopping 
his horse. “Who’s there?” 

The young planter rode out, and Alec’s joy found vent 
in a loud “huzza!” 

“Great Jemimy! Ye’re jest the feller I was lookin’ 
fer, Capt. Paul!” 



20 


PAUL JONES WEEKLY: 


“Why are you looking for me, my lad ?” 

“There was fightin’ at your plantation last night, wasn’t 
there?” 

“Ay, rather a brisk set-to with the gang of robbers who 
are trying to rule the roost in this section. They made 
an attempt to steal the sloop, but it was 'frustrated.” 

“Do ye know where the gang has their headquarters, 
Capt. Paul?” 

Alec’s eyes were bright and his face showed con¬ 
siderable excitement. 

“No,” answered the young planter, eying the lad 
sharply. “Have you any information on that point, 
Alec?” 

“Sure I have, Capt. Paul. Brother Han an’ I went 
fishin’ yesterday afternoon late, and while we was settin’ 
on the river bank we seen some rough-lookin’ fellers 
rowin’ a boat an’ towin’ the queerest-lookin’ craft that 
ever come inter these waters. 

“It looked like a flatboat, but there was a cabin on it, 
an’ a smokepipe cornin’ out o’ the roof of the cabin. 
Han an’ I hid an’ saw the men tow the boat inter a 
creek, where it couldn’t be seen from the river. 

“The men got out o’ the boat, an’ I saw then that one 
o’ them was that Skipper Cockle who made ye sp much 
trouble below Norfolk. 

“ ‘Now that we got the Roost anchored,’ says one, 
‘jest come aboard, Cockle, an’ we’ll lay our plans fer 
ter-night. There’s some prime grog aboard the Roost, 
an’ I reckon ye ain’t averse ter wettin’ yer whistle, eh, 
old sea dog?’ 

“Then the lot o’ them went inter the cabin on the flat- 
boat, an’ Han an’ I lit out fer home,” 

“Why didn't you bring word to me about this before, 
Alec?” asked Capt. Paul. 

“I was kinder mixed up like in my mind, an’ didn’t 
know what ter do. When a trader showed up from 
downriver this mornin’, an’ brought word o’ the trouble 
at your plantation, I thinks o’ the flatboat at once. ‘I’ll 
lay a straight course fer Capt. Paul,’ says I ter myself, 
‘an’ tell him about the Roost.'” 

“Is the flatboat still in the creek?” 

“She’s there. I jest come from that way, an’ I stopped 
long enough ter creep up on the Roost an’ look through 
a cabin winder.” 

“Was there anyone in the cabin?” 

f 

"Three men, Capt. Paul, an’ rough-lookin’ chaps they 
are, too. They had weapons hanging from nails in the 


wallwas carryin’ on 'as though they had been drink 
They _,_as. sin-, an’ would jest as soon shoot a n 
as ter look at him.” 

Capt. Paul now understood why it was impossible 
the planters to follow the trail of the robbers with 1 dogs 

When they fled, after committing their depredatio 
it was by water, and they left no trail. 

By moving the Roost about from place to place th 
were able to fend off discovery and continue their nefa 
ous work. 

“How far is that creek where the Roost is hove 
from here, Alec?” 

“Not more’n two mile, Capt. Paul.” 

“Then point your horse the other way, lad. We’re g 
ing there.” 

Alec gasped. 

“Are we goin’ alone, sir?” 

“Why not? You said there were only three of t 
rascals in this robbers’ roost It’s a good time to raid t 
place.” 

“It wouldn’t take me long ter ride ter the ferry a 
git dad.” 

“I»don't need dad! Turn your horse and lead t 
way.” 

“That’s jest’ like Capt. Paul!” exulted Alec, whirlit 
his horse about. “You’ll tackle anythin’ that comes yoi 
way, big or little. I druther sail with you than with ai 
other man in shoe leather!” 

The two miles were covered swiftly. 

When within a bowshot of the creek, the two diJ 
mounted and tied their horses. 

“Have you a weapon of any kind, Alec?” asked Cap( 
Paul. 

“No, captain,” replied the lad; “an’ that’s what’s woi 
ryin’ me. I can’t do ye much good without somethin’ ta 
shoot with.” 

“Possibly you can be of aid—after a little,” 

■ Side by side they crept up to the brushy margin ci 
the little stream, not far from the point where it enterd 
the Rappahannock. 

On hands and knees Capt. Paul parted the tangki 
thicket in front of him and peered out at the queer-lookiq 
craft that rubbed its side against the bank. 

Alec had described it well. 

It was nothing more or less than a flatboat with, 
rude cabin occupying the larger part of its deck. 



• PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


From within the cabin came roaring voices, singing a 
lutical catch known as “Tom Bowling.” 

“Remain here, Alec,” whispered Paul, “and do not 
ir until I call you. Here’s an opportunity to nab three 
: this lawless brood, and I cannot let it slip.” 

“Have a care of yerself, Capt. Paul!” admonished the 
d, as the young planter rose from the thicket, cautiously 
ished his way through to the edge of the bank and 
larded the flatboat. 


CHAPTER IX. 

CAPT. PAUL PLAYS TO WIN. 

Capt. Paul’s daring maneuver was executed with a 
{are that kept any suspicion of it from the boisterous trio 

t 

h the cabin. 

Drawing his pistols from his belt and grasping one in 
jach hand, he suddenly kicked open the door and entered 
die robbers’ rendezvous. 

There were three men there, just as Alec had said. 

And they were gallows birds, every mother’s son of 
hem—as ripe for murder as for eating a meal or drink- 
jjag a glass of grog. 

Just then, however, they were taken at a disadvantage. 

Not only were they somewhat under the influence of 
liquor, but their surprise was so intense as to be well- 
Mgh ludicrous. 

For a full minute they stared at Capt. Paul with jaws 
igape and bewilderment in their eyes. 

Then, voicing wild oaths, they sprang up and reached 
ip, as though they would snatch their weapons down 
From the wall. 

“Pray do not trouble yourselves, gentlemen,” said 
[ones; “you may be three against one, but the first to 
urn a weapon on me goes out of this world suddenly!” 

The young captain brought his pistols to a level, cov- 
ring the rascals before him. 

There was a glint in his eyes that spoke volumes for 
iis resolute purpose, and the trio of worthies exchanged 
ipprehensive looks and sank back into their seats. 

“Who might you be ?” queried one, hoarsely. 

“Capt. Paul Jones,” was the airy reply. “You paid 
■our respects to me last night, and I am now but re¬ 
timing the compliment. Flat on the floor, the three of 

'OU!” 

"Hey?” 

The unusual order startled the rogues. Capt, Paul re¬ 


peated the command, accompanying it with a significant 
flourish of his pistols. 

The three men dropped instanter, lying at full length 
on the cabin floor. 

“Turn on your faces, hands behind you!” went on 
Capt. Paul. 

The order was obeyed. 

“Alec!” shouted the young planter; “this way, Alec!” 

The lad was heard rending the brush in his haste to 
reach the boat; another moment and he sprang to the deck 
and ran in at the open door. 

“Great Je-mi-my!” he cried, surveying the prostrate 
robbers. “Have ye killed ’em all, Capt. Paul? I didn’t 
hear any shootin’.” 

“They’re alive, right enough, Alec,” answered Capt. 
Paul, “but they must be bound. Find ropes somewhere *, 
there must be a supply of material in this vipers’ nest.” 

Alec found some suitable cords in a locker, and with 
a dirk taken from one of the prisoners he cut the cords 
into lengths and made the hands of the robbers fast at 
their backs; then he performed the same duty at their 
ankles. 

When this was finished, the young planter thrust his 
pistgls back into his belt, turned the rogues on their 
backs and proceeded to twist more of the cord between the 
jaws of two of them—thus making effective gags. 

The third man—whose appearance suggested that he 
■was the most intelligent of the three—Capt. Paul re¬ 
served for cross-examination, holding another piece of 
cord ready for his gagging when the cross-examining 
was done. 

“There are arms on the wall, Alec,” said he; “take what 
you please and then do an anchor watch on the deck out¬ 
side. I took these scoundrels by surprise, and we must 
not let their comrades treat us in similar fashion.” 

Alec, delighted with the chance to use the robbers’ 
weapons, pushed four pistols into his breeches band, 
slipped two dirks into the breast of his linsey shirt and 
laid hold of a flintlock rifle. Thus armed to the teeth, 
he went forth from the cabin and performed sentinel duty 
on the after deck. 

“The fortunes of war, gentlemen,” said Capt. Paul, 
seating himself on one of the vacated stools. “There is a 
neat gibbet in Williamsburg, and you’d decorate it finely! 
Where’s old Truepenny ?” 

“Don’t know nothin’ about sech a man,” asserted the 
rogue who could talk. 



PAUL TONES WEEKLY. 


“Have you so soon forgotten your leader? Refresh 
your memory a little. How about Skull-and-Crossbones 
Cockle? He’s a fit mate for old Truepenny, and I sup¬ 
pose they’re cruising together, eh?” 

The young captain’s knowledge seemed to astonish all 
three of the prisoners. 

The two who were gagged mumbled behind their 
cords, while their comrade used his free tongue and 
swore heartily. 

“Ye’re the very devil, Paul Jones!” 

“Thank you for your high opinion.” 

“How did ye find out old Truepenny was away with 
Cockle an’ the man-o’-war’s man?” 

“When I play at picquet I never give away my hand 
to those who play against me.” 

“Ye’re a rum uni” 

“Did old Truepenny, Cockle and the man-o’-war’s man 
bring the ladies to this roost of yours ?” 

“Mayhap. If ye know so much, ye ort ter know that, 
too. I’ll tell ye how ye can find out what ye want ter 
know?” 

“How?” 

“Stay here long enough, my blood, an’ old Truepenny, 
Cockle an’ the man-o’-war’s man’ll come back. When 
they do, ye can ask ’em what ye want ter know.” 

The fellow grinned sardonically. 

“Thank you for the suggestion,” answered the daring 
Capt. Paul. “It’s a good one, and, as I’m playing the 
cards to win, I believe I shall carry it out.” 

“Old Truepenny an’ Cockle’ll make a lead mine of ye, 
if ye do!” 

“You’re a little bit out of your reckoning when you 
say that.” 

Capt. Paul got up and stepped to the door. 

“Alec,” said he, “go back along the bridle path and tie 
the horses further off in the timber. When you return, 
come into the cabin.” 

“Ay, ay, sir,” answered the lad, and at once leaped 
ashore. 

The captured rogue had no idea that Capt. Paul was 
about to carry out his suggestion—which proved how little 
he knew the youth. 

Impetuous in the extreme, the young planter had led, 
and was in future to lead, many a forlorn hope, wresting 
success from the very teeth of adversity. 

A bold, even a reckless, policy ever appealed to him. 

As a first step in his plans, he silenced the third man 


with a gag as he had silenced the other two; then h 
unceremoniously rolled them under some bunks buil 
against one of the walls. 

In looking for ropes to bind the prisoners, Alec had 
delved into a locker containing rough clothing. 

Capt. Paul had made mental note of this, at the time 
his wit suggesting the use to which the homely gear waj 
now to be put. 

Over his coat he drew a much-frayed shirt of buck 
skin, then covered his lower limbs with linsey breechei 
and leggins; about his middle he strapped his trust} 
sword, giving his pistols their wonted place under his 
belt. 

His own hat he tucked away under the leather shirt 
replacing it with an old beaver. 

From a much-begrimed lanthorn pendent from the ceil 
ing he secured a little candle-black, with which hi 
smeared his face and hands. 

It was a very much transformed Paul Jones resulting 
from these devices. His best friend would not havi 
known him. 

Having completed the change from Capt. Paul t( 
freebooter, he awaited the return of Alec, resolved t( 
test upon him the completeness of the change. 

In a few minutes a crashing of the bushes on tht 
creek bank informed the young planter that some ora 
was approaching. Stepping to a window commanding 
that side of the little stream, he waited expectantly. 

A form appeared directly, but it was not the form ol 
Alec Gilpin. 

A bandaged head showed above the thicket and was 
followed by the broad, tall figure of the man-o’-war’sl 
man. 

Did he come alone, or were Cockle and old True¬ 
penny in his wake? 

Capt. Paul had no time to ascertain this. Even if 
the skipper and the leader of the band were with the 
man-o’-war’s man, they were but three to one, and he 
had already got the better of such odds. 

Seating himself on a stool, he waited. 


CHAPTER X. 

THE LAST OF THE “ROOST.” 

The man-o’-war’s man came from the direction h 
which Alec had gone to attend to the horses. ? 

Capt. Paul hoped in his heart that no harm had be-

PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


fallen the lad, and felt sure there had not, for Alec was 
teen-witted and able to take care of himself. 

The sailor scrambled to the deck of the Roost and 
altered the cabin. 

At the sight of Capt. Paul, he seemed nonplused. 
“Ahoy!” the sailor grunted, stopping short and staring 
it the disguised planter. “Are ye one o’ the crew o’ this 
:raft ?” 

“I am,” returned Capt. Paul. 

“I disremember seein’ ye among the lot,” growled the 
Other. “The cut o’ yer jib is summ’at furrin.” 

“So’s yourn, fer that matter. Dost know old True- 
benny, my buck?” 

“Ay, for a matter o’ twenty-four hours or such like.” 
“I was away among the plantations lookin’ fer fresh 
lickin’s, so ye’ve joined while I was absent from the 
t-endezvous. Sit down, mate, an’ ye’re one o’ us. Be- 
flike,” added Capt. Paul, as by sudden thought, “ye’re 
Kvith Cockle an’ Dame an’ Mistress Cronin, workin’ for 
lold King George?” 

“Ye have it right,” replied the sailor. 

“An’ what name do ye sail under? Black Bart is what 
ihe lads call me.” 

“Rotherick is my name, Ben Rotherick, A. B. Barrin’ 
p. crack I got on the skull, I’m as able a seaman as ever.” 

“Help yerself to a noggin’ o’ rum,” said Capt. Paul, 
generously, waving his hand toward the liquor on the 
table. 

By then the young planter felt easier in his mind. It 
was a safe guess that Rotherick had come to the flat- 
boat alone. 

The man-o’-war’s man drained a full mug, dried 
his lips on his sleeve and settled back with a satisfied grin. 

“Nothin’ like drink to rest a man’s nerves an’ body,” 
he commented. “Since I left Cockle, an’ Truepenny, an’ 
the women, I’ve been afoot. We ran afoul o’ hard luck 
last night, an’ cleared the breakers by the skin of our 
teeth.” 

“Ye got the sloop?” 

Rotherick swore disgustedly. 

“This Capt. Paul blocked the game 1 He’s wuss’n the 
Flyin’ Dutchman fer bein’ on a dozen seas at the same 
time. I’m hopin’ fate will lay me alongside o’ him long 
enough to give me a chance to board. There’d be one 
traitor the less after that.” 

v Ye’re hot the only one who’d like to come to close 
quarters with Capt. Paul.” 


“Ay, mate, ye speak fair. But, harkye! It was Capt. 
Paul cracked my skull south o’ Norfolk, an’ all but 
scuttled Cockle an’ sent him to the bottom. 

“I had a chance at the planter last night. If his 
slaves hadn’t come in the nick o’ time I’d have settled old 
scores.” 

“But Mistress Cronin got what she was after, I hear. 
Do ye know what it was, mate?” 

“Not I. Cockle doe^, mayhap. All I know, we rode 
in the kerridge several knots due west from the Jones’ 
plantation, got out an’ took to a boat. 

“The women was landed across the river, at Sparrow’s 
plantation, an’ directly after Cockle spoke this old True¬ 
penny o’ yours, and we cruised in company till daylight; 
then I was landed on this side the river and told to regain 
the Roost and gather up a supply of powder and ball; old 
Truepenny was runnin’ short. 

“He, an’ Cockle, and me is after Paul Jones,-an’ we 
don’t leave these waters until we sink him. Burn me, if 
I don’t think we’ve got the planter on the run.” 

Rotherick got up and stretched his huge limbs. 

“This land cruisin’ ain’t to my likin’, mate,” he went 
on, “but the quicker I get the ammunition an’ git back to 
the skipper an’ old Truepenny, the sooner we’ll be able 
to up anchor an’ bear away.” 

He took the lanthorn from its swinging hook, set it on 
the table and reached for a tinder box on a nearby shelf. 

While he worked at striking a light, he kept up his 
running fire of small talk. 

“Old Truepenny lost some men last night. That 
makes him as hungry for this traitor captain’s life as 
Cockle an’ me.” 

Having lighted the lanthorn, Rotherick set it down 
on the floor beside a trap with an iron ring. Then he 
glanced around. 

“There ought to be a hatchet some’rs,” he muttered, 
and started to look under the row of bunks where the 
prisoners had been stowed. 

“I think it’s under the bunks .on this side, mate,” said 
Capt. Paul, quite calmly. 

Discovery had hung by a hair. As it fell out, it was 
merely post-bound, and was to happen later. 

By good luck, the hatchet was in the place Capt. Paul 
had indicated. 

Possessing himself of it. Rotherick knelt beside the 
trap and pulled it open with the ring. 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Reaching down into the shallow hold, he drew up a 
powder horn. 

“Empty,” he muttered, shaking the horn close to his 
ear. “I’ll have ter smash in a cask o’ powder. The 
hold’s full o’ the stuff. If the crew o’ this craft ever 
git too free with their pipes, the lot of ’em’U sail sky¬ 
ward.” 

Capt. Paul, awaiting his opportunity, was watching 
Rotherick like a weasel. 

■ As it happened, Rotherick knelt facing him, bending 
over and using the hatchet on a cask below. 

Had the man-o'-war’s man’s back been to the young 
planter, a well-directed blow would have stunned the 
fellow and made his capture comparatively an easy 
matter. 

But that, considering the circumstances, was out of 
the question. 

The head of the cask was quickly smashed, revealing 
the black contents. 

As Rotherick reached for the powder horn, one of the 
prisoners rolled from* beneath the bunk and struggled to 
his knees before Capt Paul had a chance to get at him. 

The fellow had chewed, at the cords until they had 
parted, and he was free to use his tongue. 

“Look out, Rotherick!” he roared. “It’s Capt Jones 
ye’re talkin’ to!” 

Rotherick leaped erect, glaring. 

“So, ho!” he shouted, “it’s the traitor himself, 
'the-” 

He was reaching for his dirk when the young planter 
grappled with him. 

There was a terrific struggle back and forth across the 
cabin, each man seeking to draw a weapon and bring 
the battle to an. end, the other preventing him. 

At last, with an effort that called forth all his great 
strength, Capt. Paul tore away and struck Rotherick 
from him. 

The sailor staggered backward, struck the lanthom 
with his foot and toppled it through the trap. 

From that moment it was a drawn battle. 

Neither combatant thought of anything but getting 
clear of the Roost in the shortest possible time. 

As he bounded past the man kneeling on the floor, the 
young planter lingered an instant to sever the cords 
that bound his feet, then raced on. 

He gained the after deck, caught a glimpse of Roth¬ 
erick and the robber behind him, and then- 


A bluish flash puffed upward from the hold, and a 
thunderous explosion followed. 


CHAPTER XI. 

AT MASTER GILPIN’S. 

The young planter, dazed and bewildered, found him¬ 
self, a few minutes after the explosion, standing on the 
creek bank leaning against a tree. 

His left arm, numb and bleeding, hung limply at his 
side. 

A dozen yards away the wreck of the Roost was burn¬ 
ing fiercely, floating fragments of the ill-starred craft 
littering the water for a hundred feet up and down the 
small stream. 

Rotherick was nowhere in sight, nor was the robber. 

Capt. Paul was presently aware that some one was 
talking to him, and that the muzzle of a gun was staring 
him in the face. 

“Don’t ye try ter fight, ’cause I got the dead wood on 
ye. Now, tell me what’s become o’ Capt. Paul Jones. 
Was he in that blo\y-up ?” 

Alec was behind the rifle, and in his face was a strange 
mingling of grief and determination. 

The young planter, in his borrowed garb, was not 
recognized by the boy, albeit the planter’s hat was gone, 
and, but for the excitement of the moment, Alec’s wits 
would have proved equal to the emergency. 

“I’m Capt. Paul, Alec,” answered Jones, weakly. “The 
man-o’-war’s man, Rotherick, came aboard the flatboat, 
and we had a struggle. A lighted lanthom was knocked 
into the hold on a lot of powder, and the magazine 
blew up.” 

“Capt. Paul 1” cried Alec. “Yer own mother wouldn’t 
have known ye in that get-up. Ye’re hurt! Look at yer 
hand—it’s all bloody.” 

“Yes,” said the young planter, “I had a close call of 
it and I’m not myself, yet, by a long chalk. Get the 
horses, Alec. I’m dizzy and can hardly stand.” 

As he spoke, Capt. Paul sank down at the base of the 
tree, everything in his range of vision whirling about him. 

For some time after that he had only a confused notion 
of what happened. 

He was not unconscious, as he had been in his own 
house the evening before, but he was on the verge of it. 

The rough treatment Rotherick had given him at the 
plantation might have had something to do with his hazy 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


condition; in the main, however, the explosion was to be 
jeld responsible. 

How he had gained the shore when the deck of the 
flatboat heaved upward beneath him, Capt. Paul had not 
(he slightest idea. 

He remembered vaguely that Alec came with the 
brses and lifted him to his saddle; then that they 
ihreaded the woods. 

Next, Dame Gilpin and her husband were helping him 
[rom the horse, and after that he was in a chair, Dame 
Gilpin attending to his arm and Master Gilpin holding a 
jewter mug of Madeira to his lips. 

Presently he walked to a couch, assisted by the ferry¬ 
man, and sank into a heavy slumber. 

He slept out the remainder of that day and the whole 
ff the succeeding night, apparently in as deep a trance as 
was Duncan Macbean; but it was a natural sleep, the 
deep of a man who had endured much and was far spent 
with weariness. 

His dreams had to do with the ebony box, intrusted to 
him by the Virginia patriots. 

When he awoke, the morning sun was looking in at 
the open door and Terence O’Malley and Master Gilpin 
were standing at the head of the couch. 

“Ah, ha!” cried O’Malley, “the lad’s himself again. 
Faith, it’s a wonder he’s alive at all, at all.” 

“Yez may well say that same, Masther O’Malley,” 
me an echoing brogue from the kitchen. It was Dame 
Gilpin who, like the dashing Terence, was a gift of the 
“Ould Sod” to the New World. “Many a. man would 
have been dead long since av he had gone through all 
that. Capt. Paul has done. Sure, it’s a lad av iron he is.” 

“How do ye feel, captain?” asked Gilpin, as the young 
planter sat up on the couch. 

“Hearty, thank you,” smiled the young planter. “I 
must have slept well, I take it?” 

“The whole night long, sir,” said Gilpin. 

Capt. Paul whistled incredulously. 

“Where did you come from, O’Malley?” he inquired. 
“I’m afield with some of the other planters tryin’ to 
jet a crack at old Truepenny Tyburn. They’re north of 
the river, and I rode over here for a word with Master 
Gilpin.” 

“You thought you couldn’t trust me to scatter this 
iband of robbers?” 

“Not so, me lad!” cried O’Malley. “We’d trust ye 
IQ scatter anything from a corporal’s guard o’ red coats 


to a company o’ the King’s Own. Ye’ve done your 
work, Paul; the mangy breed is scattered by that night’s 
work at your plantation an’ the blowin’ up of the Roost. 
The leader is tryin’ to get clear, an’ we’re hot after 
him.” 

“You heard about the explosion, then?” 

“Everyone has heard of it, up an’ down the river. As 
near as we can make out, three o’ the band lost their 
lives in the fight at your plantation, an’ two more were 
found near the charred wreck o’ the flatboat. That makes 
foive, an’ old Truepenny was not strong enough in num¬ 
bers to stand the loss of so many. 

“The plantations, Paul, owin’ to your gallant work, are 
well rid o’ the band; those that are left are makin’ for 
distant parts. I’m to leave ye now, happy in the thought 
that ye’re yourself again.” 

“Hold hard a minute, Terence!” cried Paul. “When 
did you halt at my place last?” 

“In the early hours of the mornin’.” 

“Had anyone called there inquiring for me?” 

“Not a soul, me boy.” 

Capt. Paul was thinking of the man who was to call 
with the letter from Mr. Adams and the key to the ebony 
box. 

The messenger had not yet arrived, and there was still 
time for him to make another attempt at recovering 
the papers. 

“How was Duncan Macbean?” 

Terence O’Malley shook his head. 

“There’s a strange case for ye! Bob Tichenor was 
there and he said Duncan’s condition was the quarest 
thing he’d ever encountered. He lies quiet enough, 
breathin’ natural and seemin’ly asleep. Sure, it must 
have been a powerful drug. But Tichenor thinks he’ll 
come around all right, an’ ye give him time.” 

O’Malley thereupon took his departure and Capt Paul 
got up and stripped himself of the borrowed gear which 
he had donned on the flatboat. 

Although his arm pained him, the numbness was gone, 
and, on the whole, it felt better. 

A brief examination showed him that he was not to be 
crippled, nor to be long without the use of the hand. 

Furthermore, he discovered that he had lost neither 
his sword nor his pistols. If he had not carried- them 
ashore after the explosion, Alec- must have found them 
and taken them in charge.

Anyhow, the weapons lay by the captain's bunk, in as 
good trim as ever they were. 

A refreshing dip in cold spring water served still fur¬ 
ther in giving back to the young planter all his cus¬ 
tomary strength and vigor; and when he had joined the 
Gilpins in a hearty breakfast, he was primed for the road 
and eager to be about his work. 

He had in mind a call at the house of Samuel Sparrow. 

Master Sparrow’s plantation lay on both sides of the 
river, and it was rather two plantations than one; each 
had its house and quarters, but the master himself lived 
on the south shore. 

If Rotherick was to be believed, the Cronins had 
crossed over to the north side, thereby putting a broad 
sweep of water between them and Capt. Paul. 

Whether they were beyond the Rappahannock still, or 
had left for other parts since the night they had fled from 
Capt. Paul’s plantation, was the point the youth wished 
to settle by a call at Master Sparrow’s. 

Since Sparrow’s mansion lay on his road to his own 
plantation, Capt. Paul would not be at much inconvenience 
in calling there. 

When the morning meal was done, the young planter 
lost no time in taking to the road. 

He followed the highroad, and not the bridle path. 

Had he desired, he could have traveled the latter 
course and thus have gained a final look at the relic of 
the robber roost which he had so successfully invaded. 

However, he had no wish to return to the spot which 
had witnessed the explosion that had cost two of the 
robbers their lives and came so near to costing him his 
own. 

There was a languid warmth even in that early hour, 
and as he galloped through the heart of the thick woods, 
redbirds, catbirds and robins sang around him. 

From some cause, his hope mounted high. 

A feeling sprang in his breast that all was not lost, 
and that the messenger who was to call for the ebony 
box would ultimately receive it at his hands. 

It would be difficult to account for this reassuring 
thought. 

So far as the ebony box was concerned, the wiles of 
Mistress Betsy seemed to have been entirely successful. 

Nevertheless, Capt. Paul spurred on with a more com¬ 
placent spirit than he had had at any time .since he had dis¬ 
covered the loss of the papers. 

- ’ By and by. he drew rein at Master Sparrow’s door. 


finding Master Sparrow himself enjoying a pipe on his 
veranda. 

The gentleman’s greeting was sour and uncordial, and 
it was plain his sad treatment at Capt. Paul’s plantation 
still rankled in his bosom. The visitor was not invited to 
dismount, so he kept his saddle. 

“May I inquire, Master Sparrow,” said Capt. Paul, 
“if you have visitors here?” 

“Gad, yes, Paul Jones,” was the grumpy answer, “you 
may inquire, but ’tis all the good it will do you.” 

“Ladies from Williamsburg?” went on Capt. .Paul, 
imperturbably. “Dame Cronin and her daughter, Betsy; 
Tories, I take it, as warm for King George as you are 
3 ’ourself.” 

“An’ they be here; what, then ?” demanded' Master 
Sparrow. 

“I would have talk with Mistress Betsy; that is all." 

“No man enters my house,” returned the planter, “ex¬ 
cept by my invitation.” 

“Mayhap you’d see fit to give the invitation, sir, an’ I 
came here with Terence O’Malley and some of the lads he 
has at his back.” 

“Zounds, sir!” exclaimed Master Sparrow. “Dost dare 
to threaten me?” 

“Nay, there is no need to wax hot over, what I say,” 
went on Capt Paul, calmly. “If the ladies are not 
here-” 

“They are not, sir; nor are they at my other place, 
across the Rappahannock. If ye seek that knowledge, 
there ye have it.” 

“I had it on fair authority that they were across the 
river ; Mistress Betsy told me herself that they were 
bound there.” 

“Gad, Paul Jones, thou hast the manners of a stable- 
boy! Ye treated them so uncivilly they were obliged to 
fly your house i’ the night, and sought refuge with the! 
Rappahanock between you and them. Yesterday, in my 
own coach, I sent them to Williamsburg. There’s for 
you, sir, an’ ye think o’ calling on me with Master 
O’Malley and his bravos. 

“ ’Slife! When his majesty, God bless him! tames 
these rebellious Colonies, there are a few I shall hope 
to see swung higher than Haman. I will not mention 
names.” 

“No need,” said Capt. Paul, coolly. 

He would have baited the old Tory further had he not.

it that moment, glimpsed no less a horseman that Cato 
lying along the highroad, bound northward. 

“Cato!” he shouted, whirling his horse and riding for 
he road. “Cato! Whither bound?” 

Cato pulled up and awaited his master. 

“I’s lookin’ fo’ you, Marse Cap’n,” said he. “We 
eard dat yo’ was at Marse Gilpin’s at de ferry, so I was 
|oin’ dere.” 

“What’s the news, lad ? Is Duncan worse ?” 

“Marse Duncan is about de same, sah. It wasn’t about 
lim I was goin’ to see yo’.” 

“What, then? Speak out, an’ be quick.” 

“A barkentine is hove to in de roads, off de plantation, 
ap’n—de barkentine Fortune, bound acrost de watah, 
Dap’n Nicholas Biddle. Cap’n Biddle he ’low he want 
o see Marse Paul immejitly. He say he done got a lettah 
o’ you, an’ dat you brought somethin’ from Williamsburg 
lot he wants ter git.” 

Then, in spite of his new-born hopes, Capt. Paul’s 
leart sank like lead. 

Here was the messenger in a hurry to secure the ebony 
ox and its inclosed papers. 

What was he to say when he met Capt. Biddle? 

An ordeal was before him from which even his brave 
pul shrank. But there was nothing else for it but to 
lace the issue. 


CHAPTER XII. 


CANNY DUNCAN MACBEAN. 

As he approached the plantation along the highroad, 
Capt. Paul saw the barkentine riding the waters in the 
oads. 

A gig was at the landing, with two sailors lounging 
it the snubposts and a fine figure of a mariner smoking 
pipe and pacing the wharf. 

Tossing his reins to Cato, Capt. Paul started for the 
'finding. 

! He had a disagreeable communication to give Capt. 
fiddle, and wanted it over with. 

* As he passed the house Scip came running out 
“Marse Paul! Marse Paul! You’s wanted in heah, 
ih!” 

a “In a few minutes, Scip,” replied the young planter. 
, ‘There’s a gentleman at the landing who wants to see 
m, and-” 

’‘Marse Duncan say he wants to see yo’ right now!” 
jpsisted Scip.

“Marse Duncan?” came in startled tones from Capt. 
Paul. “Has he recovered his senses ?” 

“Dat he has, sah. He come to a liT while ago, an’ de 
fus’ thing he ask fo’ you. I done tole him Cap’n Biddle 
was heah to see Marse Paul, and dat Cato done gone fo’ 
you; so Marse Duncan say de minit yo’ come to send yo’ 
in where he is.” 

Down at the landing Capt. Biddle was shouting and 
waving his hands. 

It was plain he wanted Capt. Paul, but Capt. Paul, in¬ 
stead of going to him, entered the house and waited on 
Duncan Macbean. 

The brave old overseer sat in a chair by the fireplace. 
He was the same Duncan he had been, and seemed none 
the worse for his long sleep under the spell of the nar¬ 
cotic. 

“Paul, lad!” he exclaimed, rising and grasping the 
young planter’s hand. “Come, I maun speak wi’ ye-” 

“But the messenger has come for that box, Duncan, and 
I have got to tell him that Tory woman took it.” 

“Ye’ll no be tellin’ him a lie, boy. will ye?” 

“You do not understand, Duncan,” went on Capt. Paul, 
“for all this happened while you were under influence 
of that powerful drug. Mistress Betsy Cronin was really 
at the door, watching and listening, when I opened the 
secret tile and placed the ebony box in the compart¬ 
ment-” 

“Losh 1” said Duncan, “well, I knew it.” 

“Old Truepenny and his band tried to steal the sloop, 
but I was aboard her and gave them a pretty go for their 
trouble. The sloop was saved and, as soon as she had 
been warped back to her moorings, I started for the 
house. 

“There had been considerable popping of firelocks, and 
I felt sure, if all was right with you, you would have 
shown yourself. When I came here, Mistress Betsy, 
candle in hand, was running her fingers over the tiles, 
looking for the one that concealed the box.” 

Duncan Macbean chuckled in his beard. 

“Go on, lad,” said he. “Why do you hang fire?” 

“What are you laughing about ?” demanded Capt. Paul. 
“’Tis a grave matter, Duncan, and not to be treated 
lightly.” 

“So, so, boy. Proceed wi’ your harrowin’ tale.” 

Capt. Paul could not understand Duncan’s manner, 
but continued: 

“I entered the room and taxed Mistress Betsy with her

perfidy. Then I saw that the black patch she wore on 
her right cheek was gone, revealing a little ‘S’-shaped 
scar. Duncan, she was the very same woman who sought 
to waylay me on the Williamsburg road.” 

“Fine I ken that!” exclaimed Duncan. “I had it in 
my noddle all along. But, proceed, lad, proceed. It’s a 
rare tale ye’re tellin’.” 

“While I was engaged with Mistress Betsy, who should 
enter the room but Skipper Cockle-” 

“Cockle!” gasped Macbean. “Ye’re no tellin’ me 
Cockle was here?” 

“The very same man, Duncan. He came, took a sword 
from above the mantel and we had to cut and thrust all 
around the room. He stumbled over the couch, the deer¬ 
skins fell aside and I saw you there, stretched at full 
length on the floor. Not knowing what foul play had 
befallen you, the sight of your form maddened me. I 
should have run Cockle through had not another struck 
me from behind. The man-o’-war’s man, Duncan!” 

“A braw plot, that!” cried Duncan, breathlessly inter¬ 
ested. “How came the Cronins mixed with such a breed 
o' vermin?” 

“They’re all for the king, and against the Colonies. 
That is the principle that drew them together. In some 
way. Mistress Betsy got wind of that box in Williams- t 
burg, and was waiting for me on the road with men to 
help her. But to go on: 

“A couple of blows dealt from the rear laid me across 
the cot well-nigh as lifeless as yourself, Duncan. When 
I drifted back to the world, the Cronins were gone. Cockle 
was gone, the man-o’-war’s man was gone! More than 
that, the secret tile was open and the ebony box was 
gone! * 

“I have tried to recover it, and, in doing so, have met 
■with some strange happenings. But of these more anon. 
Just now I cannot delay longer, but must wait on Capt. 
Biddle. He probably wonders w r hy I linger here when 
he is so anxious to have talk with me.” 

“Hoith, lad, not so fast. I’ve listened to your tale, 
an’ ’tis right that ye listen to mine.” 

“But Capt. Biddle-” 

“He has waited so long, let him wait a wee bit longer. 
Till the end o’ my days, Paul, I shall smell my bombo be¬ 
fore I drink of it. Had I done so that night, there would 
have been no trance for old Duncan. 


“The girl came while I sat here smoking an’ thinkin’ 
She talked o’ this an’ that, but never a word about the 
box or the papers. I saw her eyes gang now an’ thet 
to the fireplace, and I had suspicions. 

“Weel, she sat by the table and she did some playin 
wi’ her slim fingers about the mugs. I thought naething 
o’ it, fool that I was. Then she poured some bombo, and 
we drank together; then, by an’ by, I was off to the land 
o’ Nod, realizin’ what had happened, but no more able 
to prevent what was cornin’ than a bairn. 

“Yes, somehow, I was fu’ content as I dropped asleep. 
Can ye guess why?” 

“This is no time for guessing,” answered Capt. Paul, 
sharply. “Duncan, all this can wait until after I see 
Biddle.” 

“It can no wait,” answered the Highlander, stoutly, 
“An’ ye won’t guess why I was content, I’ll tell ye. Be¬ 
cause,” and here he leaned toward Capt. Paul, hi^ old 
eyes winking cannily, “because, my lad, I had opened 
that secret place early i’ th’ evenin’ an’ removed the ebony 
box.” 

Paul was on his feet with a gasp. The overseer’s 
words had fair stunned him. 

“You had removed the box?” he repeated, blankly. 

“Ay, lad. I feared the young woman; an’ I was sure 
she had listened in the hall while ye put the box away 
an’ told me o’ it. So I. opened the secret place an’ took 
it away. ’Twas on my own responsibility-” 

“Where is the box now ?” whispered Capt. Paul, husk¬ 
ily, “where is it?” 

Duncan Macbean lifted the top of Capt. Paul’s tobacco 
jar. 

“Had ye done some smokin’, lad,” said he, dryly, “on 
had I awoke befure, much worryin’ ye maun hae been 
saved.” 

From the tobacco jar, a grim smile on his lips, Dun J 
■can took the ebony box and handed it to Capt. Paul. 

The young planter stared for a moment; then he 
caught the overseer’s hand fervently. 

“I trow well, Duncan Macbean,” said he, with emoi 
tion, “ye ha’e saved my honor this day.” 

“Your honor, lad, is as dear to Duncan Macbean as hi4

m- But your honor was not concerned. Ye had done 
I that mortal man could to haud the box an’ deliver 

Heavy steps resounded in the hall, and a well-built man 
sea togs entered the room. 

“Nicholas Biddle, gentlemen,” said he. “Which o’ ye 
Capt. Paul Jones?” 

“I, sir,” answered the young planter, stepping for- 
ird. 

“I have a letter for you. The wind serves, and I must 
zzy in my ship at the earliest possible moment.” 

Capt. Biddle took a letter from the pocket of his coat. 
“Will you please to read this, Capt. Jones?” he asked. 

CHAPTER XIII. 

CONCLUSION. 

The letter, as expected, was from the hand of Mr. 
iams, and requested delivery of certain papers brought 
3 m Williamsburg. 

“The letter is all right, as far as it goes, Capt, Biddle,” 
id the young planter. “Have you anything else about 
u that proves your authority in this matter ?” 

“A key, Capt. Jones,” and the skipper produced a 
ninutive key, swinging about his neck by a bit of cord, 
was told to be careful of the letter and the key, and 
ey have been by me night and day from the moment I 
ceived them.” 

“This box I was instructed to deliver to you on receipt 
the letter from Mr. Adams; but you were also to open 
t box.” 

“I will do so, an’ the key fits the lock.” 

The key fitted and the box was opened, revealing a 
.cket of papers. 

“Art satisfied, Capt. Jones?” inquired Biddle. 
“Perfectly.” 

The ebony box was closed, locked and Capt. Biddle 

: 

msferred it to an inner pocket of his coat. 

“That is ail, I believe?” said Biddle. 

“One thing more, captain,” said Capt. Paul. “Caesar!” 
The black dodged into the room from the hall. 

‘lYass, Marse Cap’n!” 

“A tankard N of that right Madeira.” 


Tankard and goblets were brought, and the Madeira 
poured. True to his resolve, canny Duncan Macbean 
sniffed of his glass while holding it in his hand. 

“A toast, Capt. Biddle,” said Capt. Paul. “Will you 
honor us with one?” 

“Right cheerfully. Standin, an’ you pl ease. ” 

They rose to their feet. 

“To the Colonies!” murmured Capt. Biddle. “Mav 
these dispatches, whose purport I know not, aid our peo¬ 
ple in the coming war with Great Britain!” 

Eyes to eyes, they drank the toast and set their goblets 
down. 

“No more,” said Capt. Biddle, briskly. “I have tarried 
too long already. Farewell to you, gentlemen! I trust, 
Capt. Jones, when we meet again 'twill be in ships on 
the high seas, with the British before us.” 

“Amen to that, captain!” said John Paul Jones. 

“I maun fight ashore,” put in Duncan. “The sea was 
never to my likin’.” 

.They accompanied Capt. Biddle to the landing and 
cheered him as he put off to the barkentine in his gig. 

Then they waited on the wharf until the barkentine 
spread her sails and vanished along the Rappahannock. 

“Hast any idea, Paul, what those papers are about?” 

“No more than Biddle; yet I imagine they are secret 
instructions for some trusted agent in Europe.” 

“I had thought the like.” 

“Duncan,” said Capt. Paul, once more grasping the 
overseer’s hand, “I shall never forget what you have saved 
me this day.” 

“The fact that I hae been usefu’ to ye is mair than 
enough, boy,” said Duncan, and no more ever passed 
between them concerning the ebony box. 

That afternoon, Terence O’Malley and his riders came 
back; and with them came a bushy-bearded gentleman in 
buckskin, his hands tied behind and his feet roped under 
his saddle girth. 

No less a personage he proved than old Truepenny 
Tyburn. 

He was much chagrined over his capture, and loudly 
declared that Skipper Cockle and the Cronins had been 

A 

the cause of his downfall. . 



PAUL JONES WEEKLY. 


Finding him bitter against the skipper and in talka¬ 
tive mood, Capt. Paul proceded to quiz him. 

“Hoiv long have you known Skipper Cockle?” . 

“Three days belike, and they were three days too many 
for my own good.” 

“Did he engage you to help steal certain papers-” 

“I know nothing of any papers. He paid me fifty 
guineas down to help steal yon sloop. I got the guineas 
but Master Cockle did not get his sloop. Yet even the 
guineas are gone, an’ fiere am I.” 

“Where are your followers?” 

“At the bottom of the Rappahannock, two blown up 
with the Roost, and a few more at large in the forest. 
We did bravely here, Capt. Paul, until you came.” 

“You made war upon me,” said the young planter, 
“and have only yourself to blame for what befell.” 

“Mayhap; yet it boots not to think of what might have 
been.” 

“Dost know what has become of Cockle?” 

Old Truepenny swore. 

“No,” said he, “nor care. He is somewhere among the 
plantations, hot with rage for you. He swears he will 
have your life, an' he lives. I have sworn a like oath, 
so look to yourself should I cheat the hangman.” 

“I will not worry much on your score, old Truepenny; 
nor on Skipper Cockle’s, either.” 

“It’s a fine fighter he is, Paul,” spoke up O’Malley. 
“Faith, before we downed him he had broken half a 
dozen heads with his rifle butt. If he had had powder, 
there’d have been some lives lost.” 

Capt. Paul knew well how it chanced that old True¬ 
penny was out of powder. Rotherick had not been able 
to get away from the Roost with any, and the robbers’ 
store had gone to perdition with the lawless craft. 

“How about Rotherick, old Truepenny?” 

“Ye're askin’ more than I can tell, Capt. Paul,” an¬ 
swered the prisoner. “But the man-o’-war’s man must be 
alive; he, like Cockle, was born to grace a yardarm, so 
he’ll live till he gets his deserts.” 

“Whence did you come before making these planta¬ 
tions your prey?” 


“My past is a closed book,” frowned the robber, “a 
let it be. I’ll tell ye naught of it.” 

Seeming to realize that talk could only injure his caa 
from that on the prisoner held his peace. 

He was taken to Yorktown, tried and neatly hung. 

O’Malley afterward told of the overland trip to tH 
York River, and of a futile attempt, presumably mail 
by some of the escaped members of the gang, to resctt 
their old leader. 

Capt. Paul learned, before many days, that Dani 
Cronin and her fiery daughter were at the Cronin tow« 
house in Williamsburg. 

He did not trouble them with their misdeeds; loyal H 

6 

the king as Mistress Betsy was, she felt, perhaps, tha 
she was doing her duty in her unsuccessful attempt t! 
wrest the patriots’ papers from the hands of Capt. Pad 

“Ye’re slow to tell the vixen in these ladies o’ quality 
lad,” observed Duncan Macbean, sagely. “A pretty fact 
an’ a pair o’ bright eyes have proved mony a man's un 
doin’. Remember that.” 

“A woman in distress, Duncan, has a right to even 
man’s sympathy and aid,” answered the young planter. 

“Losh!” said Duncan, with a shrug. “Chivalry, as yi 
call it, is like to entrap ye, one o’ these days, with mor 
serious consequences. I suspected that young womai 
o’ designs on ye the minute she showed herself at th 
plantation. She was bound for Master Sparrow’s, ove 
the river! Ha! She was far afield an’ did not even ex 
cuse herself by sayin’ she was lost.” 

Hugon, released by Capt. Paul and his back salved wit 
a guinea, was started toward Williamsburg with th 
chariot and horses. 

“A guinea wasted,” quote Duncan. “Will ye no lear 
to be economical, Paul?” 

The young planter’s hand and arm healed quickly, an 
he was soon again in the midst of a series qf thrillin 
adventures. 

What these were, the reader may learn by reading th 
story to follow, which will be entitled “Paul Jone 
Double; or, Cruise of the Floating Feather ." 


THE END.
