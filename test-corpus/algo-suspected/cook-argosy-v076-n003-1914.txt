GOLD GRABBERS. 
W.W. Cook

“ Is there anything crooked about 
the way got hold of that property, 
Silas ? ” inquired Bremerton quietly. 

“ Not on your life! ” and Deane’s 
expression became exceedingly vir¬ 
tuous. “ I got the property at a bar¬ 
gain, of course, intending to turn it 
over to a syndicate. I’ll make hand¬ 
somely if I can let go for half a mil¬ 
lion; but in order to "do that the bullion 
has got to come as it did a year ago, 
when I took over the proposition. You 
go down there, Lee, and straighten 
things out.” 

“ I won’t stand for anything off¬ 
color, Deane.” 

“Confound it, that’s why I want 
you! You can forget more in a minute 
about mining and milling than any ex¬ 
pert knows in a year. I’ll make it worth 
your while, old man. You ought to get 
things coming our way inside of a 
month. After that, keep up the good 
showing for six months and I’ll un¬ 
load.” 

“ What am I to get out of it—except 
a chance to go to the hospital, if I’m 
lucky ? ” 

“ Oh, bosh! When you grab hold, 
the gang will have the first real man 
to deal with that I’ve sent down there. 
They’ll hunt their holes, and you won’t 
have a mite of trouble. I know you, 
or I wouldn’t give you this chance. 

“ Of course, Bremerton, you ain’t so 
darned old, but I guess you sabe it’s 
getting pretty near time you took a 
start. Eh? Sure! Now, look here. 
I’m going to give you five hundred dol¬ 
lars a mdnth, and allow you six months 
to make that mine a winner. How does 
that hit you ? ” 

“ That will amount to three thousand 
dollars,” observed Bremerton, “ pro¬ 
vided I last for six months.” 

“You’ll last, all right. Thunder! 
If you've got any white feathers con¬ 
cealed on your person, then it’s all hap¬ 
pened in the last five years. Time was 
when they called you Lee Reckless, and 
neither hell nor high-water threw a 
crimp into you.” 

Bremerton stirred uneasily. Reck¬ 


less he had been called, but not justly. 
Occasionally he had made the most of 
a desperate situation, but not without 
care—never recklessly. 

“ If you want a reckless man, 
Deane,” he said, “ you don’t want me.” 

“ Come, now,” insisted the other, “ I 
guess I know who I want. This is a 
man’s job, and you’re the man for it. 
I’m never far wide of my trail when I 
size up a bunch of circumstances and 
pick a chap to handle ’em. But if you 
don’t want this chance—if you are not 
in need of money—” 

“ You know I’m in need of money,” 
was the sharp response, “ and you know 
I’m only waiting to grab at something 
in the way of a chance. And that,” 
Bremerton added a trifle grimly, “is 
why I’m afraid of you,'Deane. I hope, 
for old friendship’s sake, you’re not 
trying to take advantage of my neces¬ 
sities.” 

“ When you twang the sentimental 
string, old partner, you sure get me 
going! I’ll crowd a stranger to the 
wall—it’s his lookout whether or not 
his eye-teeth are cut—but the needs of 
an old friend will always hit me close 
to the heart. Lee, won’t you see, can’t 
you see, that I’m trying to do some¬ 
thing for you ? 

“ Why, you and me drank out of the 
same coffee-can years ago; and once, 
when I was nigh petered in the desert, 
you wrung the last drop from the can¬ 
teen and gave it to me. Say, do you 
imagine that all the money in the world 
could make me forget a few of those 
things? Dash it! I’m not so walled 
in with dollars that I can’t break 
through to help a chap I think more of 
than I would of a blood-brother.” 

Bremerton listened thoughtfully. By 
turning a losing proposition into a win¬ 
ner he would help Deane to half a 
million. Balanced against that was the 
three thousand dollars he was to re¬ 
ceive for the risk and the trouble. 

As though he had read his old 
friend’s thoughts, Deane leaned for¬ 
ward and dropped a confiding hand on 
his knee. 


“ But five hundred a month,” he 
went on, “ isn’t all I’m willing to do 
for you. There’s a bonus in the work. 
Make a showing, help me to unload, 
and there’s a ten-thousand-dollar stake 
for you to tuck away in your jeans. 
Maybe that wouldn’t be a boost, eh? 
Bremerton, it would start you on the 
way to Easy Street.” 

“ Tell me more about the mine, 
Deane.” 

“ Hanged if I do! It’s down there, 
and you can see it for yourself. Make 
a personal acquaintance w'ith it. I’ll 
give you a letter and a power of attor¬ 
ney; you can handle the proposition 
just as though you owned it.” 

“ What is the name of the man who 
is now in the hospital ? ” 

“ Lacey—Gordon Lacey.” 

“ I don’t want to butt in and take his 
job away from him.” 

Deane fell back in his chair with a 
choppy laugh. From under a paper¬ 
weight on his desk he took a yellow 
slip. 

“ Read that,” said he. “ It’s a tele¬ 
gram I got from Lacey the same day 
I wired you. Oh, I guess you’re not 
taking anybody’s job away from him.” 

The telegram was brief and to the 
point: 

Accept resignation. I am done 
and probably done for. 

Gordon Lacey. 

“ I’ll advance your first month’s pay, 
Bremerton,” said Deane as the telegram 
was quietly returned to him. 

“ All right,” returned Bremerton. 
“ I’ll take the job.” 

“ Hooray! When will you start ? ” 

“ To-morrow morning. Now, then, 
tell me the name of the mine, just 
where I’ll find it, and give me any other 
particulars that will help me.” 

For fifteen minutes the two were in 
close and earnest conversation; but, in 
the talk, Deane was strangely reticent 
about some things and full of detail 
regarding others. When Bremerton 
left the office he had a check for five 
hundred dollars, the confident good 
wishes of Deane, and a vague idea that 


he was taking rather a desperate leap 
in the dark. 

After all, it was that ten-thousand- 
dollar stake that settled the question, 
so far as Lee Bremerton was con¬ 
cerned. 


CHAPTER II. 

THE BRIGHT PACE OF DANGER. 

On his feet and in health, Gordon 
Lacey must have been a fine figure of 
a man. With an eye keen for the archi¬ 
tecture of bone and sinew, framing that 
mystery of the spirit which makes a 
human being worth while, Bremerton 
read the late superintendent of the 
Mariquita Mine for what he was. 

Days in hospital, with strength ebb¬ 
ing and flowing about the misty Bor¬ 
derland, had pinched and whitened the 
face of the sick man. Yet, close though 
he was to physical wreck, Lacey was 
superb. 

It was nine in the evening when 
Bremerton came to him. The young 
interne at the office desk was doubtful 
whether the patient could be seen. 
With Lacey the danger-point was past, 
and he was mending, but up to that 
hour he had been denied to visitors. 
Besides, it was too late for visitors, 
anyway. 

“ Five minutes is all I ask with him,” 
pleaded Bremerton. 

A nurse was called and sent to the 
ward. She returned with the announce¬ 
ment that Lacey insisted on a brief in¬ 
terview with the man who was stepping 
into his shoes at the Mariquita. So 
Bremerton went up, and the man in the 
white bed and his visitor exchanged 
looks and were straightway on friendly 
footing. 

“ You may have just five minutes, 
Mr. Lacey,” said the nurse, glancing at 
the open-face watch on her breast. 

“ Five minutes will do,” and the pa¬ 
tient peered at Bremerton with a hag¬ 
gard smile. 

“ What can you tell me that will be 
of help, Lacey? ” Bremerton asked. 



“ I don’t want to tax your strength, 
and I should not have come at this hour 
if another would have served. It was 
after seven when I reached Phoenix, 
and by sunrise to-morrow I shall be on 
my way into the hills. In a few words 
give me the gist of the situation.” 

“ What did Deane tell you? ” 

“ A good deal, but nothing bearing 
on the real trouble. With two super¬ 
intendents dealt with as you and the 
other have been, in a mining district 
supposed to be peaceable and law- 
abiding, there’s a deep grievance some¬ 
where. What was it Deane left un¬ 
said ? ” 

“ It is all a mystery to me, Bremer¬ 
ton.” Lacey picked thoughtfully at 
the bedclothes with his gaunt, trem¬ 
bling fingers. “ You took the job on 
Deane’s plain say-so that everything 
was square ? ” 

“ Yes.” 

“ So did I. I have had hard places 
before and got the whip-hand of them, 
but this work at the Mariquita came 
near being my finish. When I first 
came I tried to fill out the gaps Deane- 
left in his story. 

“ He secured the mine from Car- 
ruthers, who at one time lived here. I 
tried to locate Carruthers, but he had 
decamped rather suddenly, and no one 
knew where he could be found. 

“ After I had been on the job a few 
days Mallory came and told me his 
side, and used threats. I always look 
with suspicion upon a cause that is 
bolstered up with threats. I was short 
enough with Mallory, and then I was 
downed with a cowardly shot from the 
brush.” 

“ Who is Mallory ? Deane did not 
mention him.” 

“Mallory bonded the mine from Car¬ 
ruthers, and failed to come across with 
the cash when the time limit expired.” 

“ Ah! ” murmured Bremerton. 

“ And what did Mallory tell you, 
Lacey ? ” 

“ No use going into that. The old 
scoundrel will see you soon and tell you 
the same thing. What I want you to 


know, what I want you to understand, 
is this: if ever you looked on the bright 
face of danger, and felt the ground 
opening beneath you and your feet slip¬ 
ping toward bottomless deeps, remem¬ 
ber your peril when Mallory’s girl con¬ 
fronts you, as she surely will.” 

“ A woman 1” A faint smile crossed 
the strong, sun-browned face of Brem¬ 
erton. “ How is Mallory’s girl mixed 
up in this ? ” 

“ Sometimes I have thought she is 
the very soul of all the plot and coun¬ 
terplot which brought poor old Griggs- 
by to his end and came so near getting 
me.” 

Bewildered lines puckered around 
the sunken, gleaming eyes? “ But I 
don’t know; I don’t know. Angel or 
she-demon, I did not last long enough 
at the Mariquita to discover. When 
she sfhiled I found my danger great¬ 
est. She sent for me, told me she want¬ 
ed to give me information of value, and 
in riding to meet her I was snared like 
a helpless rabbit.” 

Lacey’s voice quivered with earnest¬ 
ness as he added: “ As you value your 
life, Bremerton, beware of Mariquita 
Mallory! ” 

Bremerton would have laughed; but 
out of respect for this strong spirit that 
had tried and failed, he kept the laugh 
in his throat. A few women he had 
known, and all of the best, and he had 
yet to find one who could make a fool 
of him. His one love was the silent 
places—God’s great outdoors, where 
mountain and plain were ribbed with 
gold, his for the finding. A woman 
could have no part in that. 

“ I can see you think I am babbling 
like an idiot,” went on Lacey, still 
gravely and earnestly; “but if I could 
tell you nothing else, that one thing I 
want you to know: beware of Mari¬ 
quita Mallory. Mallory himself you 
can take in your two hands and deal 
with him as an honest man deals with 
a scoundrel; but a woman, a beautiful 
woman—Bremerton, that is different.” 

The nurse came toward the bed, her 
eyes on the watch. 

“ I am afraid you must stop now,” 
said she. “ Only five minutes, Dr. Pres¬ 
ton said, Mr. Lacey.” 

“ Just one thing more, Bremerton,” 
the sick man continued. “ I had to 
leave King, the cyanid expert, in 
charge. He is a capital cyanid expert, 
but a poor hand with men. The quick¬ 
er you reach the mine the better.” 

He lifted and held out his hand. 
“ Remember what I have told you 
about Mariquita Mallory. Good-by 
and good luck.” 

Bremerton clasped the hand cordial¬ 
ly and gratefully and left the ward. 
Once clear of the hospital building he 
looked up at the round moon in the 
blue velvet sky, hesitated a second, 
then laid a course that carried him di¬ 
rectly away from the hotel. 

He was not a stranger in that town. 
Two years before he had outfitted there 
for a prospecting trip into the Harqua 
Halas. Now he wanted to get away by 
himself and think. 

His word had been given to Deane, 
and he had taken Deane’s money. For 
better or for worse, he had plunged 
into this undertaking at the Mariquita 
Mine. 

The key-note of his character was 
loyalty, and nothing could shake his 
determination to give to Deane’s in¬ 
terests the best that was in him. La¬ 
cey’s words, however, had plunged him 
into a train of reflection none too 
pleasant. 

His aimless feet brought him pres¬ 
ently to the town ditch, where the 
waters rippled musically and the moon¬ 
light silvered the cottonwoods, and 
where from the soft recesses of the 
night came the notes of a whippoor¬ 
will. 

Out of the dim past his memory con¬ 
structed a similar scene. He had gone 
into camp at.a water-hole; there were 
cottonwoods like those whose white 
trunks now rose around him, and then, 
as now, a whippoorwill sang in the dis¬ 
tance. 

But on that night, as he recalled, he 
Jhad been awakened by the cracking of 


a twig, and had fought in the moon¬ 
light with a roving Mexican who had 
tried to steal his burro and his grub- 
pack. 

Suddenly he paused, straightened 
erect, and listened. As by the water- 
hole so long ago, here by the Phoenix 
town ditch he heard a stealthy footfall 
behind him. Instinctively his hands 
clenched, and he braced himself for an 
encounter. Another moment and the 
mood passed. With a low laugh he 
leaned against the trunk of a tree. 

“ Well, friend,” he called, “ are you 
following me, or does it just happen 
that you are on my trail? ” 

The dark figure which his eyes had 
glimpsed came out of the shadow and 
into a splotch of moonlight. A large 
man in a broad-brimmed hat stood out 
against the dusky background clear as 
a silver print. The head was shaggy 
with hair and beard, and in the dark 
of the hat-brim two eyes glowed like 
points of flame. 

“ My name’s Mallory,” said a husky 
voice, “ and I’ve been following you 
ever since you struck town. Mr. Brem¬ 
erton, ain’t it ? ” 

So this was Mallory, appearing as 
Lacey had foretold, only somewhat 
before the time Bremerton had expect¬ 
ed him. 

“ Yes, this is Bremerton. I’d like to 
inquire, Mallory, why you have fa¬ 
vored me with your attention ? ” 

“ We’ll get to that,” was the answer 
as the speaker drew closer. “ You’ve 
just been to the hospital. Picked out a 
comfortable place there against the 
time you’re ready for it ? ” 

“ Did Griggsby pick out a place ? If 
he did, what good did it do him? He 
never lived to get to the hospital, did 
he ? ” 

“ I don’t know about Griggsby, and 
I don’t know who put Lacey where he 
is. All I do know is that Deane will 
never get any good out of the Mari¬ 
quita Mine, and those who try to help 
him will never get no good out of it, 
either. Deane is a cutthroat, a pirate, 
a black-hearted swine who—” 

“ You are talking of a friend of 
mine, Mallory,” Bremerton interrupted 
sharply. ' 

“ Friend ? ” A husky, jeering laugh 
came with the word. “ A fine f riend 
of yours, when he sends you into such 
a trap as that at the Mariquita. 

“ You’re wonderin’ why I’m so in¬ 
terested in your movements, Bremer¬ 
ton. I got a reason. You’d no sooner 
signed on with Deane than I knew of it. 
A telegram from Denver was relayed 
to me in the hills. I came to town, and 
have been waitin’ for you. Since you 
got here I have trailed around after 
you, looking for a chance to give you 
a bit of advice. Just out of kindness 
of heart, that’s all.” 

Recalling Lacey’s remarks about 
Mallory, Bremerton observed in a tone 
of chilling finality: 

“ When I want your advice, Mal¬ 
lory, I’ll ask for it.” 

“ No, you won’t,” the other re¬ 
turned. “ You’ve dropped into the lit¬ 
tle pit Deane has dug for you, and 
you don’t even sabe that he’s ntuy malo. 
I allow you think I’m the villain in 
these here tragedies at the Mariquita, 
but you’re wrong.” 

Mallory stepped still closer. He put 
out a hand as though to lay it on Brem¬ 
erton’s arm, but Bremerton stepped 
back. 

Now that Mallory was within arm’s 
reach of him, Bremerton could see that 
his beard and hair were iron gray, and 
that his face was old—old in ways of 
the world, perhaps, as well as in years. 

“You act as if I was a rattler,” went 
on Mallory, “ and soundin’ a warning 
before I strike. Man, you’re way wide 
of' your trail. The warning I’m giving 
you is for your own good. 

“ There are others who will strike 
if you do not listen. You’re young, 
Lee Bremerton. Five hundred dollars 
a month for six months and ten thou¬ 
sand as a bonus if you make good— 
what are they? 

“ Just a bait to lure you into the same 
fate that overtook Griggsbyl Leave 
the Mariquita Mine alone! You can 


make nothing of it, and in the end it 
will wring you dry and toss your bones 
on the scrap-heap.” 

“Clear out!” ordered Bremerton. 
“ I’ll have none of the threats you call 
advice and warning.” 

The old man drew a deep sigh and, 
without a word, turned away. He 
passed like a specter through the pool 
of moonlight and melted into the 
shadows beyond. 

Scarcely had he vanished when foot¬ 
falls reached Bremerton’s ears. Swift 
and catlike they came from either side 
and from behind. 

Bremerton was a man who always 
stood his ground. He squared himself 
now to meet what was to come. Vague, 
shadowy shapes were closing in, gli¬ 
ding toward him swiftly from three 
different directions. If that was Mal¬ 
lory’s game— 

CHAPTER III. 

THE SIEVER BALL. 

There was no challenge, no parley. 
Out from among the white-trunked 
cottonwoods hurried fantom shapes 
and in grim silence fell upon Bremer¬ 
ton. One moment he saw them com¬ 
ing, and the next moment he was 
among them and fighting. 

He had only his bare hands. His 
assailants were armed with clubs; and 
one of them had a quirt, for its thongs 
fell stingingly over Bremerton’s face 
and throat. 

The hot blood leaped in the prospect¬ 
or’s veins. These cowards — four or 
five or half a dozen of them — were 
upon him in a crowd with their whips 
and their bludgeons. £# 

They were like a pack of wolves. 
Outraging every principle of fair play, 
they would smother him under a 
weight of numbers and give him no 
chance for himself. 

Circumstances like these were more 
than enough to arouse all the savage 
resentment rn Bremerton’s nature. In 
a flash he became the Lee Reckless of 



those old days with Deane—a cornered 
wildcat—a cave man with his back to 
the wall—a fury, with all the seething 
elemental passions uppermost. 

His foes were many, and he must 
take them one by one. While he 
charged a single vague shape, he was 
forced to run a gantlet of blows that 
staggered and dazed him. 

Yet one man crumpled under the 
weight of his fist, and as the ruffian 
groaned and pitched forward the pros¬ 
pector whirled and charged again. 

Feet crunched and slipped in the 
gravelly soil; sharp, labored breathing 
rent the air in staccatolike notes, and 
over all rose the sodden thumps of the 
clubs. Again and again the prospect¬ 
or wrenched himself clear of the press. 

Perhaps not one blow in half a dozen 
reached him, for the gloom and the 
excitement sent many of them wild; but 
the bludgeons that found their mark 
had a cruelly crushing strength behind 
them. 

While he drove before him another 
of his foes the rest hung upon his back 
and belabored him viciously. Nothing 
kept him from his quarry. At the edge 
of the town canal the retreating enemy 
was forced to make a stand. 

Bremerton glimpsed the man’s 
swarthy, scowling face in the moon¬ 
light. The fellow had raised a club for 
a telling blow. Before the club could 
fall Bremerton grasped it and wrenched 
it away. Almost simultaneously his 
hard fist darted at the shadowy face, 
and the man went over the brink of 
the canal and into the water with a 
splash. 

Bremerton whirled, smashing right 
and left with the club. Another man 
was struck and beaten to his knees. 
The prospector trampled him roughly 
to get at his companions. 

A stick aimed at Bremerton’s head 
glanced and struck his right arm. The 
arm fell limp and useless as though a 
bone had been snapped. 

A sickening pain convulsed the pros¬ 
pector’s whole body, but he rallied 
magnificently. He had lost his weapon. 


and fqr offense and defense he had now 
only his left hand. 

Slowly his physical powers were fail¬ 
ing, but his resolution grew as his 
strength diminished. He sprang at 
another of his assailants, and just at 
the moment a pair of arms encircled 
his knees and he was thrown from his 
feet. Then the pack closed in. On his 
head, his shoulders, his back, rained the 
blows. His left arm protected his face, 
but finally that arm, too, dropped away. 

With a choking gasp he measured 
his length on. the ground, lying there 
helplessly while he fought to hold his 
fading senses. 

The attack ceased. Some one knelt 
beside him and whispered hoarsely in 
his ear: 

“ This is all for now; but go out to 
the Mariquita Mine and worse will 
follow. Remember what—” 

The voice died out in Bremerton’s 
ears. A pall suddenly encompassed his 
faculties, and he neither heard nor 
realized anything more. 

He drifted back to reason presently 
and found himself alone. His head 
throbbed and his whole body rebelled 
when he attempted to move. He ground 
h'is teeth to stifle a groan. 

By degrees his brain cleared. Mal¬ 
lory had threatened, and Mallory’s men 
had been handily by to make clear to 
him that the threats were to be taken 
seriously. 

“ They’ve had their chance at me,” 
muttered Bremerton hoarsely, “ and 
some day I’ll get my chance at them.” 

He tried to lift himself to his knees, 
but the white stems of the cottonwoods 
danced mistily around him, and again 
he flattened out on the earth. Water 
would revive him. If he could get to 
the canal— 

He crawled in the direction of the 
ditch, digging into the ground with his 
fingers, and pulling and pushing him¬ 
self on. Pains, like daggers, stabbed 
him in a dozen places. For all that, he 
found he could use his arms and legs, 
so it could not be that any bones were 
broken. 

He was coming out of that one-sided 
battle much better than he had any rea¬ 
son to hope. Although bruised and 
sore, he was not seriously injured. 

For several minutes he lay at the 
edge of the canal, scooping up the wa¬ 
ter and splashing it over his face. Little 
by little his strength returned. 

The night wind whispered soothing¬ 
ly among the cottonwood leaves, and 
the song of the whippoorwill echoed 
from the peaceful shadows. 

But what was this? The bird, out 
yonder—what was it singing? With 
a painful effort he lifted his bruised 
and battered body on one elbow and 
stared in the direction *of the misty 
alfalfa-fields. 

trickle from a flesh-wound on his fore¬ 
head overflowed and blinded his eyes. 
Removing a handkerchief from his 
pocket, he held it in the water and then 
passed it over his feverish face. 

“ I’m a crazy fool! ” he mumbled. 

What the whippoorwill said to the 
stars had long ago been established. 
Only his disordered fancy could make 
.anything else out of it. His wits sure¬ 
ly had gone far afield to imagine 
“ mara-fccet-ah ” the burden of those 
flutelike notes. 

What under heaven had possessed 
him, sick and suffering as he . was, to 
think of “ Mariquita ” in connection 
with that scrap of melody? 

Mariquita! Angel or she-demon— 
Lacey did not know which. Why, in 
that hour, was she in his thoughts? 

Lacey had been riding to meet the 
girl when he was shot from the brush. 
Very possibly, there by the town canal, 
she had inspired that clubbing of the 
man who was to take Lacey’s place. 
Bremerton, sopping the blood from his 
face with the wet handkerchief, cursed 
the name and her who bore it. 

At last he arose to a sitting posture, 
wrung the linen dry, and bound up his 
temples with it. He was a rifle-shot 
from the main street of the town, and 
he must get back to his hotel. 


A glow of electric lights hung in the 
sky, well beyond the shadows of the 
cottonwoods. His eyes measured the 
distance between the canal and the far- 
flung maze of the arcs and the incan- 
descents. For a man with two good 
legs under him, the way was not far; 
but for Bremerton, in his present con¬ 
dition, it was very far indeed, and per¬ 
haps impossible. 

He tried to lift himself erect; but 
only half succeeded when he sank to 
the earth again. As yet he had not 
mastered his aching nerves and mus¬ 
cles. He could crawl, at least, if he 
could not walk. 

On hands and knees, swaying uncer¬ 
tainly as he went, he made his slow 
passage toward the edge of the cotton¬ 
woods. On the scene of his struggle 
with Mallory’s bravos his groping fin¬ 
gers encountered something which 
puzzled him. 

The object was round, about the size 
of his fist, and tied up in a cloth. At 
first he thought it a slung-shot, dropped 
by one of the miscreants who had 
worked their will with him. 

He was curious enough, however, to 
grope in his pockets for a match, and 
then by its light to make a more thor¬ 
ough examination. 

Yes, at a time when another would 
have thought only of his physical tor¬ 
ments, Bremerton could give time and 
strength to trifles. In prospecting for 
gold a thousand trifles, carefully 
weighed, might lead to a “strike.” 
Years of prospecting had taught him 
the value of the little things, and he 
did not neglect them. 

The cloth enclosing the round object 
proved to be a red cotton handkerchief, 
carefully tied. He removed the cord, 
'the folds of the handkerchief fell away, 
and a small globe of frosted silver lay 
revealed. 

An exclamation of wonder escaped 
Bremerton’s lips. The silver ball was 
a sphere of amalgam-gold coated with 
quicksilver, just as taken from the 
plates of a mill and squeezed in a 
chamois skin. The squeezing had 



driven off some of the “ quick ” and 
given the mass its spherical form. 

Of course, the ball had been dropped 
by one of Bremerton’s assailants. It 
proved that at least one of the rascals 
was a mill man, or indirectly had some¬ 
thing to do with a stamp-mill. This 
in itself was no identification, as there 
were hundreds of such men in that part 
of the country. 

With the aid of another match, 
Bremerton examined the ball more 
closely. Its upper surface was a cu¬ 
rious formation of small ridges where 
the folds of the chamois had been gath¬ 
ered together and strong pressure ap¬ 
plied with the hands. The lower half 
of the sphere was smooth, save for an 
indentation that resembled the letter 
“ W.” Or was it an “ M ” ? 

Bremerton scowled. By some chance 
the Mallorys, father and daughter, 
were so vividly in his mind that he 
instinctively looked for them every¬ 
where. He growled over his folly, re¬ 
placed the ball in the handkerchief, and 
stowed it away in a coat pocket. 

Then he would have crawled on 
again had a sound not reached his ears 
and suggested caution. It was a sound 
of horses’ hoofs approaching slowly 
from the direction of the road. 

He could see the rider indistinctly, 
coming through the heavy shadows cast 
by the trees. The horse moved to right 
and left, in a zigzag course, as though 
its rider were seeking something. 
Bremerton wondered grimly whether 
he or the ball of amalgam was the ob¬ 
ject of the stranger’s quest. 

Suddenly, while he knelt there, 
watching and waiting, the approaching 
rider passed a spot upon which the 
moonbeams had full play. A gasp of 
amazement came from Bremerton. 

The silvery light touched as with a 
caress the bare head of a woman. The 
hair, shining and luxuriant, was 
brushed smoothly back from the tem¬ 
ples. In its strands the stem of a full¬ 
blown rose was entangled. 

The woman’s face was dim, yet 
Bremerton could see enough of it to 


know that it must have been wondrous- 
ly fair. Her form was erect and grace¬ 
ful, and she was mounted in a man’s 
saddle and rode as a man would ride. 

“If you happen to be looking for 
me,” called Bremerton grimly—“ this 
way.” 

The girl started, peered in the direc¬ 
tion from which the voice had come, 
and quickened the pace of her horse. 

“If you happen to be Lee Bremer¬ 
ton,” said she in a voice at once soft 
and musical, “ then I am looking for 
you.” 

He laughed huskily and jeeringly. 

“I am very much alive,” he re¬ 
turned, “ which is probably a great dis¬ 
appointment to you—Miss Mariquita 
Mallory.” 

The ill-natured remark seemed to 
make no impression upon her. Draw¬ 
ing her horse to a stop, she dismounted 
calmly and stepped in front of Brem¬ 
erton. 

CHAPTER IV. 

Bremerton knew this girl was Mari¬ 
quita Mallory. In his mind that con¬ 
viction was as fixed as fate. First had 
come her father, then her father’s men, 
and now why not the girl herself? It 
seemed peculiarly fitting. 

“ Not too close! ” he ordered sharp¬ 
ly. “ About where you are.will be near 
enough.” , 

Fear was a mental poison which his 
strong soul had never known. Some 
day, when his brain was sick and he 
was physically broken, he might know 
it; but it would not be a woman who 
caused his heart to fail and his courage 
to wane. 

He commanded the girl to keep her 
distance, because his whole nature was 
in hot revolt against her and her fa¬ 
ther and their schemes of violence. 

She gave his words no attention. 
Serenely she glided to a spot from 
which she could have reached forth and 
touched him, had she wished to do so. 


“ Are you badly hurt, Mr. Bremer¬ 
ton?” she asked softly. 

“ No,” he answered shortly. “ It 
was cowardly to set a pack of hood¬ 
lums upon an unarmed man like that.” 

“ I agree with you, and as soon as I 
heard of it I came here. I want to help 
you, to be your friend. May I have 
the chance?” 

There was a wistfulness in her voice 
which did not escape him. Lacey’s 
warning still rang in his ears, however, 
and he thought she was playing a part 
—for purposes of her own. 

“ Clear out,” he called roughly, 
“ and leave me to myself. That’s all I 
ask of you.” 

“ Are you able to get back to your 
hotel ? ” she persisted. 

“ Yes.” 

He staggered to his feet. Swaying 
drunkenly, he was compelled to lay 
hold of a tree and support himself. 

“ Madre mia,” the girl breathed, 
“ how you must have been beaten! Oh, 
the fiends, the cowards! ” She clasped 
her hands convulsively. “ And you 
think—you think that I had a hand in 
this contemptible night’s work! ” 

He could not see her face, there in 
the shadow, but her voice went through 
the phases of sympathy and indignation 
and reproach. Her acting was superb. 

“ There’s no guesswork,” said he 
sternly; “it’s all a matter of fact. 
You’re a woman, and I don’t want to 
forget that in my talking with you. 
Will you go? ” 

“ In a little while. I can’t leave you 
like this. Are you still intending to go 
out to the Mariquita Mine, Mr. Brem¬ 
erton ? ” 

“ If you and your father have any 
idea you can scare me, you will have 
to guess again. I’m going to the mine, 
and I’ll get the goods on those who 
settled for Griggsby and sent Lacey to 
the hospital. Tell your father that. I 
'don’t suppose I have any more sand 
than Griggsby or Lacey, but I’m 
tougher, and I’m going to last long 
enough to do the work that brings me 
here.” 


A breath like a sigh came from the 
dark, slender figure confronting Brem¬ 
erton. 

“ If you were not suffering,” said 
the girl, “ if I did not know you were 
in physical pain, I could tell you things 
which would make a change in your 
plans. I think you are a man of cour¬ 
age, and the brave are usually just. I 
can imagine that what you have heard 
about my father and me has not caused 
you to feel very friendly toward us; 
but don’t be hasty. Reserve judgment, 
Mr. Bremerton.” 

“ A man who will trap another with 
a crowd of hoodlums, as your father 
trapped me, wants anything but jus¬ 
tice. If he had his deserts he would 
probably be in the Phoenix jail this 
minute; and, for all I know, you’d be 
there with him. You can’t handle me 
as you did Lacey, or— 

“ Stop! ” 

The word flashed at him daggerlike. 
A temper the girl had carefully con¬ 
cealed up to that moment darted, keen 
and sharp, to the surface of her nature. 

For an instant Bremerton was sur¬ 
prised, and then he reflected that his 
rough speaking had torn away the 
mask and given him a glimpse of the 
real Mariquita Mallory. 

There was a throb of sorrow and 
undernote of grief shuddering through 
that blaze of anger, but it passed him. 

“ Don’t say something,” the girl went 
on in a stifled voice, “ that you may 
one day be sorry for. I am here to 
help you—let me repeat that again.” 

“ And let me repeat that I want none 
of your help. While I am at the Mari¬ 
quita, the less I see of your father and 
you the better.” 

After a brief space Mariquita stepped 
to her horse and laid a hand on the bit. 
Then she led the animal close to Brem¬ 
erton. 

“ Get into the saddle,” she said crisp¬ 
ly, “ and ride to your hotel. Leave the 
horse at the post in front, and I will 
either come after him myself or send 
for him.” 

Her persistence irritated Bremerton. 

“ You and your father are enemies 
of Deane’s, and so of mine,” he an¬ 
swered. “ I don’t intend to begin my 
work by placing myself under even a 
slight obligation to you. Take your 
horse and go away. I can shift for 
myself.” 

She stepped back into the moonlight. 
Her right hand lifted to the level of 
her eyes and a small revolver glim¬ 
mered in her fingers. 

“ Mount! ” she ordered. “ This will 
settle the obligation business. If neces¬ 
sary, I can force you to be sensible. 
Mount and ride to your hotel, and leave 
the horse as I told you.” 

The gleam in her eyes matched the 
silvery sheen of the leveled weapon. 
Her erect, graceful figure, the moon¬ 
beams shimmering on her hair and on 
the rose in its thick coils, the beautiful 
face framed strongly in lights and 
shadows, and over all her dominant and 
resolute bearing, conspired to form 
a picture that stirred Bremerton 
strangely. 

What a woman! One moment soft 
and gentle and pleading, and the next 
moment fiery with determination and 
enforcing her commands at the muzzle 
of a revolver! 

The novelty, the inconsistency of it 
all broke over him presently, and he 
laughed. Nevertheless, he lifted a foot 
to the stirrup and climbed weakly into 
the saddle. He rode away, leaving 
Mariquita there in the moonlight. 

The last he saw of her, the revolver 
and the hand that held it swung at her 
side, and he fancied a smile wreathed 
her shadowy lips. 

It was midnight when Bremerton 
dismounted in front of his hotel and 
walked unsteadily into the office. The 
night clerk gasped and stared at him 
wonderingly. 

His clothing was torn and earth- 
stained and in disorder, and his face 
was puffed and bruised, and a red¬ 
dened bandage was swathed about his 
forehead. 

“ The key to seventeen,” said Brem¬ 
erton, bracing himself at the counter. 


- “ Great guns! ” murmured the clerk. 
“ What has happened to you ? ” 

He had not been on duty when 
Bremerton arrived, and he hastily ran 
his eye down the page of the open 
register. 

“ I should think, Mr. Bremerton, 
that you need a doctor. Let me help 
you up-stairs and then I will call a—” 

“ I can get up-stairs alone,” cut in 
Bremerton; “ and don’t bother about a 
doctor. I’m not in such bad shape as 
you seem to think.” 

He took his key and started for the 
stairs. “ In about five minutes,” he 
added, halting a moment, “ send up a 
boy with a pitcher of ice-water and 
some telegraph-blanks.” 

“If you have been beaten up and 
robbed by thugs, we ought to get the 
police busy.” 

“ I haven’t been robbed. Just had 
a little hard luck, that’s all; and I don’t 
want the matter to go any further. It’s 
a case of least said soonest mended. 
Understand ? ” ' 

“ Certainly, Mr. Bremerton, but—” 

Bremerton waited for no more, but 
slowly ascended the stairs to his room. 
He was weak and dizzy, and after he 
had snapped on the electric light he fell 
sprawling on the bed. His aches and 
pains seemed to have been lost in a 
paralyzing nausea that filled his body. 

Had he not been in the pink of phy¬ 
sical condition, hardy and robust from 
years of wandering through the un¬ 
tracked wilderness, that beating must 
surely have been the death of him. 
Breathing hard, and with every muscle 
relaxed, he lay on his back starirtg up 
at the ceiling. 

The Mallorys had taken this method 
to frighten him away from the Mari¬ 
quita Mine. They little knew the tem¬ 
per of the man they were dealing with. 
So far from intimidating him, his reso¬ 
lution to help Deane was merely 
strengthened. 

For years he had breasted the blows 
of circumstance. The more difficulties 
he encountered and conquered the 
greater his pride' in any success he 

might achieve. Fear and discourage¬ 
ment were for weaklings. And Lee 
Bremerton had never been a weakling. 

Strangely enough, the events of the 
night brought him a certain measure of 
relief and satisfaction. He had vague¬ 
ly imagined, from Deane’s reticence in 
certain matters, that some sharp prac¬ 
tise lay back of the murderous enmity 
for Deane’s men at the mine. That 
Deane was none too scrupulous in for¬ 
warding his owh interests Bremerton 
understood thoroughly. 

Those who resort to cudgels and a 
night attack are never the ones with a 
just cause behind them. So, by impli¬ 
cation, Deane’s right to the Mariquita 
property had been proved. This was 
what afforded the. prospector his relief 
and satisfaction. 

Mallory’s daughter was a good deal 
of a puzzle. Certainly she was a splen¬ 
did actress. At first she had assumed 
a friendly attitude, hoping no doubt to 
deceive him, to win his confidence, and 
then to work upon his sympathies. 

But he had angered her by a few 
words that emphasized his knowledge 
of her true character, arid she had burst 
into sudden flame like a powder maga¬ 
zine touched by a lighted match. 

Sick as he was, he rather prided 
himself on having forced aside the 
mask for a glimpse of the real Mari¬ 
quita Mallory. Yet, in spite of his 
positive convictions, there was some¬ 
thing about the girl that defied a com¬ 
plete understanding of her. 

“ When I get over the effects of this 
clubbing,” he assured himself, “ I’ll be 
able to think to better purpose. Lacey 
was undecided in his estimate of the 
girl, but told me to beware of her. He 
appears to be a clear-headed sort of fel¬ 
low, and I can’t see why he was un¬ 
decided. My little experience with 
Mariquita Mallory has left me with no 
doubt at all. Still, if I knew more—” 

A sensation hard to define over¬ 
shadowed his conclusions. It was a 
sensation that baffled analysis. 

The mine was called the “ Mari¬ 
quita.” The name could scarcely be a 


coincidence. Of course, the girl had 
inspired it. Yet how and why, if this 
person, Carruthers, had originally lo¬ 
cated the property ? 

Had Carruthers known Mariquita 
Mallory? Had he been so greatly im¬ 
pressed with her that he had given her 
name to his mine? 

These were trifling thoughts. As 
questions, they merely harassed a mind 
which was unequal to any sort of strug¬ 
gle with them. 

A light, quick step sounded in the 
hall, accompanied by a musical tinkling 
of ice in a pitcher. A knock fell on 
the door, and a boy entered the room 
with water, telegraph-blanks, and wri¬ 
ting materials. 

“ Wait,” said Bremerton. 

His brain whirled as he rose from 
the bed and seated himself at a small 
table. A drink of ice-water refreshed 
him somewhat, and he slowly wrote out 
the following message: 

Silas Deane. Denver. 

Arrived Phoenix this evening. Work 

promises to be interesting. Off for 
. mine to-morrow. 

Bremerton. 

He gave telegram arid money to the 
boy and sent him away. Then, as well 
as he was able, he looked after his in¬ 
juries and went to bed. 


CHAPTER V. 

A QUESTION OF NERVE. 

Not always, in real life, do names 
fit the characters of those who bear 
them. As a case in point, Mortimer 
King, cyanid expert at the Mariquita 
Mine, was anything but regal, anything 
but manful and two-handed in his sway 
over men and affairs. 

From A to Z he knew his cyanid 
work. There were keenness and pene¬ 
tration in his mild, washed-out blue 
eyes. 

From a glass of “ solution ” held up 
to the light he could almost determine 
by sight alone how many pounds of 
potassium cyanid should be thrown into 

the big vat to bring its contents up to 
“standard.”. And there were those 
who said that, by merely glancing at a 
handful of “ tailings,” he would figure 
you their worth in ton lots to a cent. 

But he was not even primer-wise in 
a knowledge of human nature, and he 
was a child in tact and diplomacy, and 
a mere babe in arms when it came to 
meeting a hard situation with judg¬ 
ment and energy. 

Lacey had known this when leaving 
King in charge. Racked with pain and 
half delirious when borne away from 
the Mariquita, he had been in no con¬ 
dition to pick and choose a successor 
pro tern. 

Even so, he had yet had no second 
choice: Whatever his other short¬ 
comings, King was the only man at the 
mine who, in the absence of the super¬ 
intendent, would be loyal to Deane. 

Two weeks Lacey had been gone. 
They were weeks of mental distress for 
King, who realized fully his own in¬ 
competence. If affairs had gone badly 
under Lacey, they nearly went to smash 
under King. About all the cyathid ex¬ 
pert hoped for was to hold the mine, 
organization together until the new 
man arrived to fill the place vacated 
by Lacey. 

Troubles began almost before Lacey 
had been carried over the hill in the 
mine buckboard. The miners struck 
for higher pay, although they were re- - 
ceiving better wages than were being 
paid at any other mine in that district. 
They struck, apparently, just to be con¬ 
trary and worry Mortimer King. 

With no mining going on, the ore- 
haulers had to be laid off; with no 
drills to point, the blacksmith and his 
helper were out of a job; and with 
nothing to mill, the millmen were 
forced into idleness. 

Then the spirit of unrest laid hold 
of the cyanid workers, and one by one 
they drifted away to loaf with the 
others. King was at his wits’ end and 
telegraphed wildly to Deane. 

Everything’s going to pot. Where’s 

the new man? 


And to this Deane answered in char¬ 
acteristic vein: 

Keep your shirt on! New man on 

the job Thursday morning. 

King began counting the days until 
Thursday. On Wednesday some un¬ 
known person smuggled a supply of 
red liquor into camp. Steve Bryden, 
otherwise known as “ Big Steve,” be¬ 
gan imbibing, and slowly and system¬ 
atically working himself up to concert 
pitch. 

He made an art of getting “in 
tune,” as he called it. 

In twenty-four, thirty-six, or forty- 
eight hours, according to his own pre¬ 
arranged schedule, he would strike high 
C. Then, as King very well knew, the 
super pro tem would have difficulty 
keeping his scalp on, let alone his shirt. 

The cyanid expert would have sent 
to Phoenix for the sheriff. There was 
nobody to send, however, and he dared 
not leave the mine himself. 

Wednesday night Big Steve got a 
sledge-hammer from the deserted 
blacksmith-shop and joyously broke all 
the windows in the bunk-house. “ Just 
wanted to tease somebody, 5 ’ he ex¬ 
plained when King ventured a feeble 
remonstrance. 

The little devils in his drink-mad¬ 
dened brain were growing. The Mexi¬ 
cans fled to their jacals and herded 
their wives and children behind closed 
doors. The Americans and half- 
bloods moved their blankets to a dry 
wash and posted a guard. 

Wun Sing, the cook, barricaded him¬ 
self in the chuck shanty. From the 
laboratory King, torn with conflicting 
emotions, watched the trail from towTf 
and hoped against hope. 

It was known that Big Steve had a 
dark past. But he had not acquired it 
in his sober moments. Not much of 
good could be said of him when his 
brain was clear, although in that state 
he was never openly lawless. In drink, 
all his evil flew brazenly uppermost, 
and his black folly knew no bounds. 

Barring King, the Americans at the 

Mariquita Mine were a poor lot. La¬ 
borers of the better class would not 
work there, for the taking off of 
Griggsby had given the property a 
hard name. 

King’s presence was a necessity. He 
was the accredited agent of a Denver 
company that owned cyaniding rights, 
and King saw to it that royalties were 
paid from every clean-up. 

Big Steve was not the worst of the 
Americans when sober, but he was far 
and away the worst of them when 
“ tuned.” And from the others King 
could expect no aid. He was thrown 
wholly upon his own resources; and 
these, as already observed, were weak 
and scattering. 

Thursday morning Big Steve car¬ 
ried his pleasantries a little further. 
Breaking down the door of the chuck 
shanty, he drove forth the luckless 
Wun Sing and chased him out of camp. 

So, along with the mine; the mill, 
the blacksmith-shop, and the cyanid 
“ plant,” the chuck shanty went out of 
business. King lived on sardines and 
crackers. How the other Americans 
lived he did not know, nor care. He 
had himself to worry about. 

His naked eye could not reach far 
enough. From the laboratory he was 
now scanning the trail with binoculars. 
That was Thursday morning, and why 
did not the new superintedent come? 

The sun passed the meridian and 
slowly descended upon a stricken camp. 
King’s despair grew as the day faded 
and no one arrived to take over his 
responsibilities. 

Reason told him .to flee under cover 
of that Thursday night and while there 
was yet time. Duty warned him to 
remain, in spite of Big Steve and what 
Big Steve might do. Yes, he would 
stay; he must stay. But he wished he 
had something to shoot with. 

The cyanid expert did not close his 
eyes between sunset and dawn. At 
eight in the morning he crept cautious¬ 
ly toward the end of the pipe-line to 
renew his water supply. 

Then Big Steve, rushing from the 


chuck-shanty and brandishing a blade 
which Wun Sing used for peeling po¬ 
tatoes, drove the unhappy expert pell- 
mell in the direction of the headquar¬ 
ters adobe. 

The office-door was locked. King 
himself had secured it, and at that mo¬ 
ment the key was in the laboratory. 
White and shaking, the expert turned 
and flattened out against the adobe 
wall. 

“ Yah! ” taunted Big Steve, pausing 
a dozen feet away and leering with his 
bloodshot eyes. “ What’re you good 
for, say? ” 

His voice was thick, but he kept his 
feet steadily. His whole bearing was 
one of terrible menace. 

“Clear out, you big brute!” an¬ 
swered King, shaking the tin water- 
bucket. “ Don’t you dare come nearer 
me with that knife! You ought to be 
ashamed of yourself. By George, I’ll 
report you for this! ” 

It was a gallant effort to hold his 
own. What it cost the little cyanid 
worker a man of more Spartan fiber 
could never know. 

“ Y’ain’t got no more sand than a 
chipmunk! ” howled Big Steve. 
“ Y’ain’t even an apology for a real 
man! I’m plumb annoyed at having 
you around. King, you little wart, 
here’s where you cash in.” 

A line of heads rimmed the edge of 
the distant dry wash. A swarthy, 
ragged, palpitating group watched pro¬ 
ceedings from the Mexican quarter. 
All knew that Big Steve had reached 
the climax of deviltry, that the grand 
finale was about to be staged, and that 
immediately following it his reign of 
terror would be overwhelmed by a pe¬ 
riod of sleep and helplessness. 

But would he kill the little man with 
the water-bucket? Not one of those 
who looked on from a distance would 
have given a copper cent for King’s 
chances. King, probably, would not 
have given much more himself. 

Slowly, deliberately, Big Steve ad¬ 
vanced upon his intended victim. The 
millman’s face was puffy and splotched 

with red, a crazy glare filled his eyes, 
and as he moved onward he tucked up 
his right sleeve with his hairy left 
hand. 

“ You King, there! Run! ” 

One of those at the edge of the 
dry wash offered the advice. It was 
useless, however. King's nerves had 
buckled under the strain, and he was 
pinned to the adobe wall by the grow¬ 
ing horror of his dilemma. He was 
like a rabbit fascinated by the diamond 
eyes of a rattlesnake. 

Approaching hoofs sounded sudden¬ 
ly from near at hand. Neither King 
nor Big Steve seemed to hear them. 

The trail into camp wound around 
the end of the office building, and a 
horse carrying a double burden pres¬ 
ently emerged into view. An erect 
figure in corduroys and laced knee- 
boots, face decorated with several small 
squares of court-plaster, occupied the 
saddle; at the cantle, astride the double 
war bags, sat the Chinaman Wun Sing. 

One glance at the state of affairs by 
the headquarters adobe was enough 
for the Chinaman. With a gurgling 
cry of fear he tumbled from the horse 
and fled to a safer distance. 

At the dry wash and in the Mexican 
quarter a fresh interest was injected 
into the situation. Here was a stran¬ 
ger, possibly the new man who was 
taking Lacey’s place. He had no more 
than struck camp before being called 
upon to dispute with Big Steve the 
right to rule. What would he do? 
How would he conduct himself ? 

Intensely stirred by the progress of 
events, the Americans came out of the 
dry wash and advanced a few rods. 
The Mexicans also took places for a 
nearer view. 

For King the uncanny spell was 
broken. A cry of relief broke from his 
lips, and he flung up his arms and 
crumpled weakly down on the office 
door-step. Big Steve had withdrawn 
his attention from the cyanid expert 
and fastened jt upon the newcomer. 

“You’re the new boss, hey?” the 
niillman flung savagely at the rider. 


“ I am,” was the crisp response. 

“ Not so’s you can notice it! ” 
whooped Big Steve. “ I’ve been the 
boss here for three hull days, and the 
job pleases me a heap. I don’t share 
it with nobody. Sabe that ? P’int 
t'other way and say adios before I turn 
loose at you! ” 

“ Clear out,” said Bremerton calm¬ 
ly. “ You’re drunk.” 

“ Not so drunk I can't fight.” Big 
Steve waved the knife about his head. 
“ None of the bosses last at the Mari- 
quita! Come over here, if you got the 
sand; come over here and git scalped.” 

Bremerton flung the reins over his 
horse’s head, swung down from the 
saddle, and started toward Big Steve. 
He neither hurried nor lagged. He 
merely strolled in Big Steve’s direction, 
unarmed apparently, and with his com¬ 
pelling gray eyes fixed unswervingly 
upon the face of the trouble-maker. 

More than one of the spectators 
caught his breath and felt a chill of 
grisly foreboding. King tried to shout 
a word of advice and warning, but his 
tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. 

Big Steve had planted himself firm¬ 
ly on his stocky legs, and his right hand, 
with the short, ugly blade, was poised 
for a blow. He stood like a man of 
stone while Bremerton drew close. 

Then a most astounding thing hap¬ 
pened. Quick as chain-lightning, 
Bremerton gripped the upraised wrist 
and wrenched it downward and side- 
wise. The knife fell from Big Steve’s 
fingers, and, over the captured right 
arm, master and man looked into each 
other’s face. 


CHAPTER VI. 

Bremerton’s “ bind.” 

Big Steve was accustomed to hav¬ 
ing his own way when his brain was 
befogged with liquor. No doubt the 
surprise of finding some one who was 
not afraid of him had taken him aback 
for the moment and given Bremerton 
the advantage. With a bellow of rage 



be wrenched his arm free. Bremerton, 
kicked the knife toward King and 
stepped back warily. 

- “ I’ll kill you for that! ” fumed Big 
Steve, running his words together in a 
way that made them almost unintel¬ 
ligible. 

He was losing his steadiness, and he 
staggered as he rushed at Bremerton. 
The latter moved to one side, thrust out 
a foot, and the millman stumbled over 
it and lurched headforemost to the 
ground. He struck heavily, and his 
forehead came in contact with a stone 
which was half embedded in the gravel¬ 
ly soil. A wheezy gasp escaped him, a 
tremor ran through his huge body, and 
he flung his arms wide and lay still. 

Bremerton stared at him a moment 
in silent contempt. Turning to King, 
he asked: 

“ Is this the fellow who chased the 
Chinaman out of camp? ” 

“ Yes,” was the answer. “ Big Steve 
has been on a tear ever since Wednes¬ 
day. Jove! That was a nervy thing 
you did. I wouldn’t have been in your 
shoes for all the gold in Arizona.” 

“ Who is he ? ” 

“ Amalgamator in the mill—one of 
the best amalgamators in the business. 
He has his peculiarities, though.” 

“There’s no room here for a man 
of his stripe. When he sleeps off that 
jag send him to me for his time. Here, 
you! ” Bremerton beckoned to the men 
near the dry wash. “ I need some of 
you.” 

They came forward with alacrity. 
What they had just seen had inspired 
a certain amount of respect for the new 
superintendent. 

“ Carry this man away,” ordered 
Bremerton. “ One of you put out my 
horse and bring the riding gear to the 
affice. One minute, first.” 

He whirled and ran the man over 
with a sharp, appraising eye. “ What 
were you doing over there while that 
big ruffian was trying to massacre the 
little fellow ? ” 

The men shifted about uneasily. 
One of them finally spoke: 


“ Pilgrim, when Big Steve’s in likker 
we-all makes it a p’int to hide out and! 
watch keerful. Meddlin’ with Steve at 
them times is uncommon risky.” 

“ Mean to say you were all scared? ” 

“ Wall, now, I don’t reckon I’d say 
skeered. There’s a mighty sight of 
diff’ence between being skeered and 
exercisin’ plain caution with a madman 
like Steve when he’s on the rampage. 
I allow you plumb hypnotized him.” 

“ You’ve been drinking, too,” said 
Bremerton, quick to read the signs. 
“ Hereafter, when any of you want to 
get drunk, you’ll do it in Phoenix, and 
not at the Mariquita Mine. I’m taking 
Lacey’s place, understand? While I’m 
in charge there’ll be no whisky in camp. 
Remove that man and look after my 
horse.” 

“ On the jump.” 

Bremerton pulled the saddle - bags 
from behind the cantle and passed to 
the office-door. King, anticipating a 
demand for the office key, had hurried 
to get it from the laboratory. 

“ When things began to go wrong 
here; Mr. Bremerton,” he explained, 
“ I thought I’d better lock up the 
office.” 

“ You are Mortimer King ? ” 

“ Yes.” 

The new superintendent stepped 
through the doorway into the square 
little room where the clerical work was 
carried on. King had paused to watch 
three of the men pick up Big Steve. 

Two or three articles dropped from 
the amalgamator’s coat while he was 
being lifted. One was a bag of to¬ 
bacco, another a flask, and still another 
ivas a square of dingy chamois skin. 

“ Better gather up that stuff and take 
it along,” said King. 

“ Hold on a minute,” interposed 
Bremerton. 

He hurried out of the office and set 
his heek on the flask. For a moment 
his eyes rested on the chamois skin. 
An exclamation escaped him and he 
stooped and picked it up. He stuffed 
the chamois skin into his pocket as he 
went back into the office. 

“ Now, Mr. King,” said he, “ justr 
what is the situation here? I found 
the Chinaman camping out at a water- 
hole between here and town. He told 
me a little, but only enough to make 
me anxious for more.” 

Bremerton sat down in front of the 
roll-top desk, took pipe and tobacco 
from his pockets, and prepared for a 
smoke. King drew up a chair, sank 
into it, and composed his agitated 
nerves. 

There was something about the new 
superintendent that inspired confidence. 
Courage and determination are quali¬ 
ties which never fail to command the 
wholesome respect of enemies and the 
trust of friends. As the weaker ves¬ 
sel, King deferred humbly to Bremer¬ 
ton, glad that Deane had secured such 
a man to captain the dubious fortunes 
of the mine. 

A strong face shone lividly in the 
light of the match Bremerton trailed 
over the pipe-bowl. Bruised, discol¬ 
ored, and with here and there a black 
patch, along with its grimness, the face 
contrived to reflect an amiable as well 
as a dauntless spirit. Little Mortimer 
King warmed to the man and did not 
hesitate to confess his own failings. 

“ I was a pretty poor stick for Lacey 
to leave in charge, Bremerton,” said he'. 
“ I have no sense or sand in dealing 
with the near-desperadoes on this 
mine’s pay-roll. The men knew it, and 
Lacey was hardly carried over the hill 
before they began to take advantage.” 

“ Don’t bear down on yourself, 
King,” returned Bremerton. “ Some¬ 
times the difficulties that are one man’s 
meat are another man’s poison. A few 
in this world are equipped for one 
thing, and a few for some other thing. 
The Master Potter fashions the clay 
from designs and patterns of His own. 
It is not our business to go behind the 
returns and try to puzzle out the rea¬ 
son. Go on and tell me about the sit¬ 
uation here.” 

King was surprised to find Bremer¬ 
ton as forceful in thought as well as 
in action. He did not know of the 


lonely years Bremerton had spent in 
the wilds, communing with himself as 
he trod the unblazed trails, or guessing 
at the heart of things as he lay on a 
blanket looking up at the stars. 

The cyanid expert began at the be¬ 
ginning. He told of the strike among 
the miners, and how the failure of the 
ore supply had paralyzed all the other 
activities of the camp. 

As an idle man is always ripe for 
trouble. King’s report led up logically 
to the whisky-drinking and the cutting 
loose of Big Steve. Bremerton listened 
quietly and, when King paused, re¬ 
marked: 

“ It’s a wonder you didn’t cut and 
run.” 

“ But I was left in charge! ” ex¬ 
claimed the expert. “ It was my busi¬ 
ness to stay here, no matter what 
happened.” 

A quizzical light filled Bremerton’s 
gray eyes, yet he nodded soberly. 

“ I see. When a man does his best 
there is nothing more to be said. When 
did you have your last clean - up at 
the mill ? ” 

“ Just after the miners quit work. 
The millmen hung on for a while, 
and I kept them busy scraping the 
plates.” 

“ How did the clean-up pan out ? ” 

“ Slim. It’s always slim and not 
what it ought to be. That’s what 
bothered Lacey and—and poor old 
Griggsby. We mill ten tons of rock, 
working both shifts. The ore-feeder 
throws out every tenth shovelful as 
the ore goes into the hoppers. I 
quarter the samples down and get a 
value of twelve dollars and some odd 
cents to the ton—” 

“ No bonanza rock about that,” 
cut in Bremerton. 

“ There’s been no bonanza rock 
milled since Deane took over the 
property. If it’s here we haven’t been 
able to find it. The tailings, coming 
from the plates, assay something over 
two dollars to the ton. 

“ The difference of about ten dollars 
a ton, or a hundred dollars for a 

twenty-four hour mill-run, should be 
left on the plates. But it isn’t there.” 

The best we can show, the best 
we’ve ever been able to show since 
Deane secured this property, is seven 
hundred to a thousand dollars for 
every two weeks’ clean-up.” 

' “ Fifty dollars a day,” mused Brem¬ 
erton ; “ not enough to pay expenses. 
You’re being robbed.” 

“ Griggsby thought so, and Lacey 
was of the same opinion. But they 
couldn’t prove anything. The leak, 
wherever it is, has been too well 
covered. You are right in saying we 
don’t pay expenses with the mill. The 
cyanid plant is just able to cover the 
shortage. That, of course, doesn’t 
leave anything for Deane—and he’s not 
running a mine for the love of it.” 

“ No, King, he doesn’t do much of 
anything for the mere love of it,” 
Bremerton remarked dryly. “ We’ll 
go into all this later. I haven’t been 
myself for a couple of days, and the 
ride from town rather fagged me. I 
think I’ll rest until after dinner. 
Where do I bunk ? ” 

King got up and opened a door off 
the side of the room. 

“ Here is where Griggsby and 
Lacey had their sleeping quarters,” 
said he. “If you’d rather not sleep 
here, though, there’s a more comfort¬ 
able place down at the laboratory.” 

“ This will do. Tell the miners to 
see me after the noon meal.” 

“ I’ll have them here—if they’ll 
come.” 

“ The man that doesn’t come hunts 
another job. Impress that on them.” 

King left the office. As soon as he 
was gone, Bremerton got up, went to 
the table and removed, a handker¬ 
chief-wrapped package from one of 
the saddle-bags. He unlocked the desk 
and pushed back the roll-top. 

A litter of papers lay under his eyes, 
just as left by Lacey. He brushed the 
papers aside, untied the handkerchief, 
seated himself, and leaned forward to 
examine the ball of amalgam. 

“ It’s a clue, all right,” he muttered. 


“ Here’s a bit «f luck right at the 
start-off. Let’s see how that ‘ M ’ 
matches the mark on the mended 
chamois.” 

The chamois skin dropped from 
the pocket of the unconscious Big 
Steve was an old one. Almost in its 
very center a jagged, ‘ M ’—-shaped 
tear had been mended with needle and 
thread. The sewing had been done 
by whipping the thread over and over 
along the edges of the tear, leaving 
an upraised surface. 

This surface mark matched the in¬ 
dentation in the bottom of the 
amalgam ball perfectly. It was evi¬ 
dence, indisputable evidence, that the 
mended chamois had been used in 
squeezing some of the quicksilver out 
of that particular lump of amalgam. 

Circumstances pointed a damning 
finger at Big Steve. They led also to 
interesting speculations regarding the 
finding of that stolen silver ball among 
the cottonwoods by the Phoenix town 
canal. 

While Bremerton bent thoughtfully 
over the desk, a sheet of paper met his 
eye on top of the heap he had pushed 
aside. Picking it out of the litter, he 
read the following, written in fine 
feminine chirography: 

Mr. Lacey: 

If you will come to me at the arroyo, 
at nine this evening, I will tell you 
something of great importance to 
yourself. Trust me this once and you 
will not regret it. 

Mariquita Maleory. 

Bremerton dropped back in his chair, 
a savage exclamation on his lips. 

“ It’s the note that lured Lacey into 
a trap! ” he murmured, and dropped 
it on the desk and struck it with his 
clenched fist. 


CHAPTER VII. 

THE FATE OF A PICTURE. 

Bremerton’s long, hard ride from 
Phoenix had almost worn him out. He 
had spent the whole of the preceding 



day in bed, and every movement of his 
bruised limbs had brought him pain. 
In the small hours of that Friday 
morning he had dressed, bargained at 
the nearest corral for a horse, and be¬ 
fore sunrise had put miles behind him 
on the way to the Mariquita Mine. 

At first his stubborn will had to goad 
his battered body into action. As his 
ride progressed, however, his stiffened 
limbs and flagging muscles yielded 
with growing grace to the grim pur¬ 
pose that drove them. 

His iron physique, dormant for a 
space, recuperated swiftly. He was 
like a machine which, slow to start at 
first, presently yields to the spell of 
motion and runs with increasing ease 
and power. 

Not until he entered the headquar¬ 
ters adobe had he been conscious of 
any feeling of fatigue. He had dis¬ 
missed King and planned to lie down 
for a brief rest. But he could not 
leave the desk until he had tested the 
clue of the amalgam ball and the cha¬ 
mois skin; and now that brief note 
from the Mallory girl aroused feelings 
that made rest impossible. 

He got to his feet, leaned against the 
top of the desk, and swept his eyes 
around the office. There, in premises 
just taken over by him, Griggsby and 
Lacey had lived and worked—-Griggs¬ 
by and Lacey, the unfortunate men 
who had preceded him in the service 
of Deane. 

The letter-files on the shelf, the map 
on the wall, the cabinet of ore speci¬ 
mens, the letter-press, the table in the 
center of the room, the picture of the 
martyred Garfield hanging near the 
door—all these trifling details of the 
room appealed to him strongly. 
They constituted surroundings which 
Griggsby and Lacey had known to 
their sorrow. A black memory was 
over everything — and the Mallorys 
were the cause! 

Bremerton, frowning darkly, swore 
to himself that he would bring home 
to the girl and her father the conse¬ 
quences of their deeds. Making a win¬ 


ning proposition of the Mariquita 
Mine was but a part of his work; the 
other part was to make sure that 
Justice had her due. For the killing 
of Griggsby, the wounding of Lacey, 
and the work of that cowardly gang 
by the Phoenix town ditch, some one 
should pay! 

Bremerton passed to the open door 
and leaned there, looking out upon the 
camp. The mine lay in a shallow val¬ 
ley bordered with bleak hills covered 
with cactus clumps. The ramshackle 
structure housing the ten-stamp mill 
stood at the left, perched on the top 
of an incline of the valley floor. 

Flanking the mill on one side were 
the cyanid tanks, and hard by the tanks 
was the shake-roofed, shake-sided lab¬ 
oratory building. In the middle dis¬ 
tance was the bunk-house, with its 
shattered windows. To the right of 
the bunk-house stood the chuck-shanty. 

Beyond Wun Sing’s headquarters 
was a cleft in the valley wall, in which 
were huddled the jacals of the Mex¬ 
icans. Between mill and bunk-house 
were posted the derricks, with their 
whips, and the shaft-house, with its 
hoisting engine. 

The whole valley was gouged and 
gophered and sprinkled with heaps of 
country rock. The road from the 
shafts to the head of the mill had been 
powdered white by hoofs and wheels 
and gleamed in the sun like a trail of 
whitewash. 

There was nothing alluring in the 
scene, nothing even picturesque. The 
valley wore a forbidding, threatening 
look. Like a long, black serpent, the 
pipe-line trailed past the Mexican quar¬ 
ter, coiled around the chuck-shanty, 
and reared an ugly, spouting head mid¬ 
way between the bunk-house and the 
headquarters adobe. A branch of it 
crawled on to the cyanid tanks and the 
mill. 

Silence brooded over the place. The 
men from the dry wash were loafing 
about the bunk-house, and there was 
activity manifested among the Mex¬ 
icans. 



Big Steve had ceased to rule the 
camp, and the laborers were taking 
heart. A new superintendent had 
come, and while he might not last 
long, yet his protecting arm was over 
the property for a time, at least. 

“ And Deane’s price for this junk- 
heap,” muttered Bremerton, “ is half 
a million! I am the connecting link 
between Deane and that money — his 
last chance, his only hope for a big 
clean-up. Well, we shall see. If 
there’s anything better than ten-dollar 
rock here I’m going to find it.” 

He left the door, took an automatic 
revolver from one of the saddle-bags, 
and carried it with him into the sleep¬ 
ing-room. There was a musty smell 
in the cramped quarters, and he raised 
a window. Before lying down on the 
cot he placed the weapon handy by, on 
a chair. 

With a sigh of relief he stretched 
himself out on the blankets of his 
creaking bed. He relaxed every tired 
muscle, but he did not want to sleep, 
and his mind kept busy. Mentally he 
catalogued the successive steps of the 
work before him. 

First, the mine must be put in run¬ 
ning order. Next, the leak in the mill 
must be investigated. Following that, 
he would learn why the property had 
been called a bonanza with only ten- 
dollar rock finding its way to the 
stamps. 

A duty which might come first or 
last, or distribute itself over the entire 
process of rehabilitating the mine, was 
searching out the stealthy forces en¬ 
gaged in a death-grapple with' Deane. 

To reorganize the workers and keep 
in motion the wheels of mining, mill¬ 
ing, and cyaniding was the smallest 
part of Bremerton’s problem. Judg¬ 
ment and determination would take 
care of that. 

Probing the thievery in the mill 
would not be so difficult, now that 
Bremerton had a reliable clue* Big 
Steve was not a man to be discharged, 
the superintendent now decided, but 
to be retained, kept at work, and 


watched. He was the key to the miss¬ 
ing amalgam. 

With only a ten-stamp mill to grind 
out rock whose gross assay value was 
but little better than ten dollars to the 
ton, the Mariquita Mine could never 
approach the splendid proportions of a 
bonanza property. 

Here there was something wrong. 
Deane was altogether too smart a spec¬ 
ulator to be hooked by a job of salt. 
When he secured the mine he had cer¬ 
tainly known what he was doing. 

Nor would the Mallorys fight so 
savagely to keep Deane out of his 
rights if the object of that fight was 
such a poor-paying proposition as 
showed on its face. They must know 
something, that old plotter and his 
girl. Yet what was it they knew? 

Bremerton’s one answer to this ques¬ 
tion was, a fabulously rich lead — a 
lead known to the Mallorys, but lost to 
Griggsby and Lacey. While Mallory 
had worked the mine under bond it 
had paid huge returns. 

Those returns had captured the 
grasping fancies of Deane. Deane’s 
men, however, had failed to make the 
mine pay anything more than running 
expenses. The only explanation of 
such a state of affairs was a rich vein 
on the property, which had defied the 
efforts of Griggsby and Lacey to find 
it. 

It was possible that suqh a vein 
might have been worked out and ex¬ 
hausted. Disputing this theory was 
the fact that the Mallorys would not 
fight for a mine whose ore was hardly 
worth the trouble of digging and mill¬ 
ing. No, the Mallorys had an object in 
keeping up that struggle with Deane. 

There was a reef of gold which, un¬ 
covered once, must be brought to light 
again. As Big Steve was the key to 
the missing amalgam, so the Mallorys 
were a key to that lost lead. 

Bremerton’s thoughts covered these 
various topics slowly and methodically. 
He wanted to be sure of his ground as 
he mentally paced it off. Two or three 
hours passed, and he finally became 

aware that his eyes were absently re¬ 
garding a framed photograph on the 
adobe wall. 

Absorbed in his reflections, he had 
looked at that picture without seeing 
it. Now, abruptly, he recognized the 
original of the photograph, and sat up 
suddenly on the cot. 

Another picture, framed among the 
cottonwoods and lighted with the 
moon’s beams, flashed out before him. 
This picture on the wall was the same, 
even to the lustrous tresses with the 
full-blown rose tangled among them. 

Getting to his feet, he walked around 
the foot of the cot and snatched the 
picture from the wall. It was framed 
in cactus-wood, and he stared at it with 
hard eyes. 

Had Griggsby placed it there? Or 
Lacey? He could not bring himself 
to think that either of his predecessors 
had been so foolish. 

Very likely it was a souvenir of the 
days when Mallory was working the 
mine. Griggsby and Lacey had merely 
left it hanging on the wall. 

Bremerton muttered a fierce impre¬ 
cation and drove his fist through the 
frame. Twisting the cactus-wood 
apart, he flung the fragments out of 
the window. Then he picked up the 
picture, tore it in pieces, and flung the 
scraps after the wreck of the frame. 

“ I’ve no room here for even a pic¬ 
ture of Lacey’s she-demon,” said 
Bremerton with a scowl. “ A fine 
souvenir for me to look at! The eyes' 
of a wildcat! Every glance of them 
would remind me of the note that 
lured Lacey into a trap! ” 

Some one entered the outer room. 
A shuffling footstep crossed the floor, 
halted, and a thin voice called: 

“ Missa Blemton! ” 

He stepped out of the sleeping apart¬ 
ment and found Wun Sing holding a 
covered tray and smiling blandly. 

“ What do you want, Sing? ” he 
asked. 

“ Me blingee chuck. Missa King 
tellee me you sick. Plaps you likee 
eatee chuck in office, huh ? ” 


“ King’s got it wrong. I’m not sick. 
I’ll eat with the men, Sing. Take the 
food back to the chuck-shanty.” 

Wun Sing’s face showed chagrin 
and disappointment. He wavered a 
moment, then turned and shuffled to¬ 
ward the door. 

“ Awri,” he remarked. 

Ten minutes later Bremerton sat at 
the head of a long table in the chuck- 
shanty. At his right sat King. Some 
twenty faces, not one of the sort to 
inspire confidence, ringed the table 
from King around to Bremerton’s left. 

“ Boys,” observed King a little 
doubtfully, “ this is Mr. Bremerton, 
the new superintendent.” 

One or two ducked their heads. A 
few more grufited. The majority 
merely stared and said nothing at all. 

“ Don’t say anything if it hurts,” 
said Bremerton, with a quiet smile. 
“ You may not be glad to see me, but 
don’t do any guessing until we’re bet¬ 
ter acquainted. It must be rather 
pleasant for you to have a hot meal 
after a day or two of living on scraps 
in the dry wash. If you had helped 
King keep order in camp, Wun Sing 
might have remained on the job.” 

These words seemed to startle some 
of the men. A few exchanged glances, 
but others bent sullenly over their 
plates. 

“ Are these miners and millmen, 
King? ” inquired Bremerton casually 
as he began eating. 

“ Both,” was the reply; “ along with 
the blacksmith and a couple of ore- 
haulers. The rest of the men are keep¬ 
ing house in the Mexican quarter.” 

The men ate like famished animals, 
but they cleaned their plates in a hurry 
and passed out of the shanty. 

“ They’ll wait outside for you, 
Bremerton,” confided King in a shiv¬ 
ering whisper, “ miners and all. I told 
them you wanted to see them. If you 
don’t raise their pay they’ll start a 
riot.” 

“ I’ll not raise their pay and they 
won’t start any riot.” 

Bremerton picked up his hat from 

the floor beside his chair, got to his 
feet, and proceeded calmly through the 
door. Filled with dire forebodings, 
the little cyanid expert arose and fol¬ 
lowed. 

CHAPTER VIII. 

CHOMBO OP THE KNIFE. 

Bremerton realized very well that 
his first real fight was just ahead of 
him. Every man at table had passed 
under his keen scrutiny and been men¬ 
tally tagged. So artfully was it done 
that the men themselves did not know 
it, nor even King. 

Here was a tool, there a sneaking 
fomenter of discontent, yonder a weak 
character who ran with the biggest 
pack. Two had the courage to be 
openly defiant, and but one of this pair 
was marked for a leader. 

So Bremerton registered that table¬ 
ful of workers. On the swiftness and 
sureness of his judgment he based his 
plans for dealing with the strikers. 

The men had formed themselves in¬ 
to a compact group a few yards from 
the door of the chuck-shanty. Their 
number had been increased by the ar¬ 
rival of Mexican miners from the 
jacals, and quite a formidable’gather¬ 
ing awaited the new superintendent. 

It had been the privilege of all these 
miners to see Deane’s latest recruit in 
action. They had been afforded a test 
of his mettle, and a wholesome regard 
for his powers had been engendered in 
their minds. 

But there was a difference between 
Big Steve Bryden, charged with devil¬ 
try and aimlessly demoralizing the 
camp, and a crowd of underground 
workers who presented a solid front of 
opposition and were swayed by a com¬ 
mon cause. 

There was courage in numbers, and 
the miners were eager to see how 
Bremerton would meet this second test. 
If he weakened, they would walk 
rough-shod over his feeble authority. 

Bremerton had halted just outside 


the chuck-shanty door to fill and light 
his pipe. It looked like an attempt at 
bravado, a bluff at hiding an attack of 
nerves, and some of the strikers 
laughed jeeringly. 

“ King,” said Bremerton, “ who is 
the man with the rings in his ears ? ” 

“ That is Chombo Gonzales,” was 
the murmured response, “ half Amer¬ 
ican and half Mexican. He’s a fore¬ 
man among the diggers, Bremerton, 
and a bad man to get stirred up.” 

“ And who’s the one with the scar 
on his right cheek?” 

“ Collins, ‘ Red ’ Collins, another 
foreman. Red is on the day shift and 
Chombo looks after the night men.” 

Bremerton was positive that Chom¬ 
bo and Red were the two keys to that 
little difficulty. If the two foremen 
were properly taken care of the trouble 
in the underground workings would 
quickly adjust itself. The superinterid- 
ent moved out toward the men. 

“ What’s the reason your men are 
not getting put the ore, Collins?” he 
asked. 

The red - headed foreman felt flat¬ 
tered at being singled out in this way 
by Bremerton. It gave him an im¬ 
portance which Chombo resented with 
an ugly flash of the eyes. 

“ The boys think they ain’t paid 
enough,” said Collins. “ Three dollars 
a day for ten hours is what they get, 
and they demand four.” 

“Why?” 

“ Because we want it, that’s why! ” 
put in Chombo, jumping clear of the 
ranks and making it plain that he was 
to be considered in the discussion. 

Bremerton turned on the half-blood 
and eyed him calmly. 

" I’m talking with Collins,” he re¬ 
marked. “ When I’m ready to talk 
with you you’ll have a chance to re¬ 
lieve your mind.” 

“You can’t muzzle me!” cried 
Chombo. “ I’ll say what I please and 
when I please.” 

Bremerton peered at him ominously 
for a moment, then swerved his gaze 
back to Collins. 

“ How much are other mines in this 
district paying their miners ? ” he 
inquired. 

“ Two and a half and three,” was 
the reply. 

“ Then three dollars for ten hours 
is about the top price ? ” 

“ In other mines, yes, but it’s worth 
more to work at the Mariquita.” 

“ I understand the Mariquita is the 
safest mine in the district, no shoring 
necessary, and quarters fairly com¬ 
fortable. Why it is worth" more to 
work here ? ” 

“ Because,” said Collins, “ the camp 
has a black name. For one thing, too 
much shootin’, now and then, that’s 
liable to go wild; for another thing, 
Deane got it on a plain steal, and he 
ought to give up as much as can be 
gouged out o’ him.” 

“ As for the shooting, Collins,” 
returned Bremerton, “ I’m here to 
look out for that. It’s no concern of 
yours nor of any of the others. As 
for the way Deane got hold of the 
property, that is none of your busi¬ 
ness. The miners are paid a good 
price for working here, and that’s 
enough.” 

“ You can’t crowd us with no such 
talk! ” shouted Chombo excitedly. 
“ We’ll have our rights or we’ll have 
nothing. We—” 

“ I’ll give you your rights, Gon¬ 
zales,” cut in Bremerton. “ Come to 
the office in ten minutes and get your 
time.” 

Chombo stared, his lean body 
crouching and his ugly little eyes 
blinking. 

“ Por Dios!” he gritted. “You 
can’t fire me! ” 

“ But I have,” asserted Bremerton. 
“ You’ve done your last stroke of 
work at the Mariquita Mine, and as 
soon as you’re paid off you will take 
yourself out of camp. I’ll not have 
a cur of your stripe hanging around 
here.” 

Chombo had been fingering at the 
breast of his flannel shirt. King 
suddenly uttered a cry of warning. 


Quick as thought the half-blood’s 
right hand had executed a movement 
backward and forward, and from his 
tawny fingers had shot a bright gleam 
of steel. 

Bremerton fell sidewise. The gleam 
grazed his shoulder, flew on to the side 
of the chuck - shanty, and struck and 
hung with a steady glitter. It was 
a knife, blazing in the sun, and the 
point was embedded in the board wall. 

The tragic silence that followed the 
knife-throwing lasted for a brief 
moment. Bremerton righted himself, 
lifted a hand, and the stillness was 
broken by the sharp report of a re¬ 
volver. The sound faded into a cry 
of pain, and Chombo stood reeling on 
his feet, his left hand clasping his 
right arm and a trickle of red oozing 
from between his fingers. 

“Try that again,” snapped Brem¬ 
erton, “ and I’ll be more particular 
about my shooting. King,” he added, 
“ take him to the office and pay him 
off, then watch while he gets a good 
start along the trail. Collins, step 
over this way! ” 

Chombo was cowed and had 
nothing to say. The rest of the miners 
watched while King, trembling and 
distraught, moved toward the office 
with the half-blood staggering behind 
him. 

The cyanid expert was expecting 
a clash in which Bremerton would 
get far and away the worst of it. 
Bremerton, however, remembered 
how those men had kept to the dry 
wash and the Mexican quarter while 
Big Steve was on parade, and he knew 
they dared not resent his treatment of 
Chombo. 

.The red-hajred Collins moved in 
Bremerton’s direction, but he came 
humbly and obediently, as one who 
had just endured a shock and was 
slowly recovering his wits. The su¬ 
perintendent led him aside. 

“ How much are you getting as 
foreman, Collins ? ” inquired Bremer¬ 
ton. 

“ Three and a half.” 

“ The miners are getting every cent 
they are entitled to. I guess you know 
this mine is barely paying expenses, 
and if the pay is raised all around I 
shall have to call on Deane to cover 
a shortage.” 

“ That’s Deane’s lookout, not 
ours.”

“ It’s my lookout, not Deane’s. 
Make no mistake on that score. You 
are a man of influence, Collins. I can 
see that. If you tell these miners’ 
they’re getting the limit, they’ll believe 
you. In your case I’m willing to make 
an exception. If you can get them 
back to work and keep them at work, 
from now on your wages will be five 
dollars a day. You need not say any¬ 
thing about that if you don’t want to. 
This is the only concession I will 
make. If those men don’t begin get¬ 
ting out ore this afternoon, they can 
come for their time this evening.” 

Greed showed in Collins’s narrow¬ 
ing eyes. “ I’m to have five a day, 
am I?” he demanded. 

“ Yes, so long as you keep the gang 
at work.” 

“ You’re on, Bremerton, but keep it 
quiet. I’ll see that they go to work.” 

Without paying any further 
attention to the strikers, the superin¬ 
tendent walked on to the office. 
Chombo was moving off along the 
road, tying up his arm with a red 
cotton handkerchief as he went. King, 
his face pale under its tan, stood in 
the office door. 

“ Letting Chombo go,” said he, 
“ will raise the deuce among the 
Mexicans. They’re a clannish lot, 
Bremerton. I wish I’d explained that 
to you before.” 

Bremerton laughed softly as he 
pushed past the little cyanid man and 
dropped into the chair in front of the 
roll-top desk. 

“ Would you put up with Chombo, 
after what happened, if you had been 
in my place? ” he asked. 

“ Whatever I’d have done would 
probably have been the wrong thing,” 
was the answer. “ But it’s the devil’s 


own job, here at the Mariquita, to 
know what’s best to do in the pinches.” 

“ It strikes me that the first step is 
to get rid of the trouble-makers. I’ve 
fired one and bribed another, all in 
the interests of peace. The ore will 
begin to come, King.” 

“ The men are going back to 
work ? ” 

“ Yes.” 

“ Well, by gracious! ” King was 
looking out of the door. “ Collins 
seems to be arguing with the men, and 
they’re moving toward the shaft- 
house. How did you do it, Bremer¬ 
ton ? ” 

“ I made it worth while for Collins 
to line up on our side. The work must 
go on here. After I’ve got better 
acquainted with the situation it may 
not be necessary to handle Collins 
with gloves. We’ll see about that 
later. Start the cyanid gang at once. 
If you have any further trouble with 
them, call me.” 

King, taking fresh heart, left the 
headquarters adobe and started 
toward the tanks. He found his own 
workers in a most receptive frame of 
mind. Not one of them had any fault- 
to find over the treatment of Chombo. 

Later in the afternoon the teamsters 
were hauling ore to the platform at 
the head of the mill. The stamps 
were pounding, and a batteryman was 
temporarily looking after Big Steve’s 
part of the work. 

Only a few hours had passed since 
the new superintendent had arrived at 
the demoralized camp, and already the 
work of mining and milling had been 
resumed, and the big vats were being 
loaded with tailings for another “ run.” 

“ If Bremerton can only last,” King 
was saying to himself, “ we’ll do 
something here yet.” 

The night shift took hold of the 
work in mine and mill, when the day 
crews left off, and Bremerton slept 
that night with the roar of the stamps 
filling the valley—ten 850-pound 
hammers, each falling at the rate of 
ninety-eight times to the minute, 

beating out Deane’s gold for Deane’s 
ultimate success with the Eastern 
syndicate. 

Big Steve was sleeping off his 
spree in the bunk-house, the vengeful 
Chombo might be plotting somewhere 
in the hills, and the “ gang ” under 
leadership of the Mallorys was 
probably making ready for the next 
move. 

• None of these things bothered 
Bremerton. It was his part to take his 
difficulties as they came, and deal with 
them as his judgment counseled at 
the moment. He had made a good 
start and, for the present, that 
sufficed. 


CHAPTER IX. 

A DECLARATION OF WAR 

Saturday and Sunday passed with¬ 
out bringing any fresh difficulties for 
the new superintendent. The camp, 
which clung to that seared and 
blighted valley like a barnacle to the 
hulk of some weatherbeaten ship, 
resounded with the peaceful activities 
of mining and milling. 

The distant hills were blue and 
serene, and gave not the slightest hint 
of harboring enemies who were eager 
to stalk and slay. 

Bremerton settled comfortably into 
the routine of his work. He came 
and went about the mining property 
with the perfect nonchalance of one 
to whom fear and worry are un¬ 
known. 

Bart Case, otherwise known as 
“ Smear,” one of the ore-haulers, re¬ 
marked upon the super’s calmness and 
apparent ease of mind. He addressed 
himself to Dutch Fred, the other 
teamster. 

“ The fool ain’t got sense enough to 
know he’s a marked man, Dutch.” 

“Vat I care?” was the passive- 
response. “ He’s a goner in two weeks, 
I bet you.” 

“ What’ll you bet ? I don’t care 
nuther, but it’ll be plumb interestin’ to 


bet and then watch for what happens. 
Lay you a dozen bags o’ smokin’ he’s 
still on the job come two weeks 
Saturday.” 

“ I don’t get smoking much easier 
as dot, Smear. It’s a go.” 

In this manner Bremerton’s tenure 
of life become a gamble among the 
men. But Smear was unjust. The 
superintendent was not a fool. He 
understood thoroughly that he was 
gambling with fate. The stake was 
large, however, and he was cheerfully 
taking a gambler’s chance. 

Monday morning two events came 
to pass. One Bremerton was expect¬ 
ing. The other was a surprise. 

Directly after breakfast, Big Steve, 
hollow-eyed, his cheeks flabby and of 
a sickly yellow tinge, tramped heavily 
into the office and ranged himself 
alongside the desk. He emitted a rasp¬ 
ing cough by way of claiming the super¬ 
intendent’s attention. 

Bremerton was studying a penciled 
map of the Mariquita property. He 
did not look up until Big Steve had 
brought a hamlike fist smasing down 
on the desk top. 

“ Think I’m going to wait here all 
’day?” demanded the amalgamator. 
“ I’m after my time.” 

Bermerton sat back and regarded 
the huge form fixedly. 

“ Oh, it’s you, is it? ” he asked. 

“ Yes, it’s me, and I’m here for my 
money.” 

“ Going to quit ? ” 

The flabby jaw fell open and the 
sunken eyes stared. 

“ Ain’t that what you said ? ” de¬ 
manded Big Steve. “ Didn’t you tell 
the boys to break it to me that I was 
fired?” 

“ I believe I did, but I’ve changed 
my mind. Bryden, we heed an 
amalgamator. I’ll merely assess you 
for the bunk-house windows and keep 
you on if you’ve a mind to stay.” 

Big Steve drdw his' thick fingers 
across his head, in a puzzled way; 
then, thinking Bremerton was afraid to 
discharge him, he laughed craftily. 

“ Oh, I’ll stay, but I don’t pay for 
no bunk-house windows.” 

“ It’s only fair that you pay for 
them, but I’ll not insist. Go up to the 
mill.” 

The amalgamator tramped out a 
little more heavily than he had 
tramped in. The new boss was 
afraid to give him his walking papers! 

He looked back at the door and 
chuckled in his hairy throat. Some 
time he’d have another chance at Brem¬ 
erton, and they’d see which of ’em 
could run that camp. He was pawing 
the bruise on his temple and still 
chuckling as he walked to the head of 
the mill. 

King, little as he knew about the 
management of men, thought that 
Bremerton had made a grave mistake. 
At any cost, Bryden should have been 
made to go. 

Among themselves the men won¬ 
dered. Most of them came to the 
same conclusion as Big Steve and 
thought that Bremerton was afraid to 
get rid of the amalgamator. 

Others, who remembered Chombo 
and the way Bryden had been man¬ 
handled at the climax of his lawless¬ 
ness, could not accept the easier con¬ 
clusion and were at a loss to under¬ 
stand the queer move. 

The superintendent was well con¬ 
tent to let the matter rest as it was, so 
long as his real reason for keeping 
Bryden in the mill was not known. He 
was also chuckling over the incident 
when a beat of approaching hoofs 
drew his eyes to a near-by window. 
From the rim of the valley a rider was 
advancing along the trail. 

The rider was a woman. She sat 
her horse manwise, and her graceful 
figure, swayed rhythmically as she 
galloped. Bremerton’s face hardened. 

“ Talk about nerve! ” he muttered. 
“ I told her to keep away from me, yet 
here she comes. Well,” he added 
grimly, “ when she’s done with this 
visit she’ll never make another.” 

He started to rise, preparatory to 
leaving the office and meeting the girl 


outside. Something held him to his 
chair, however, and glued his eyes to 
the window. 

Mariquita Mallory presented a 
picture, beautiful by contrast with 
that seared and blasted valley. It was 
not that she rode with skill and grace. 
It was the girl herself that added a 
touch to the ugly environment—a soft¬ 
ening, exquisite touch which caught 
and held Bremerton’s eyes in spite of 
him. 

There was a place in the Mogollons 
where the sun sets as nowhere else in 
the whole world. He had camped on 
the spot for a week just to see the 
flaming ball go down, watch the crim¬ 
son and gold fade and then feast his 
eyes on the purple afterglow. 

It was a far cry from the Mogollons 
to the Bitter Root range in Montana, 
and yet Bremerton knew of a height 
in the Bitter Roots where the sun 
never rose as it rose there. 

In the Southwest the brazen shield 
pops upward from the desert’s rim as 
though flung abruptly from a mighty 
hand. One moment it is dawn, and 
the next, day. 

But over that height in the Bitter 
Roots it comes slowly, flinging out 
streamers that grow and grow until 
the whole east is filled with orange 
and yellow, and the faint western stars 
are blotted out one by one. 

Bremerton had a soul for the finer 
things of life. He saw beauty where 
others would pass it by. With the 
eye of an artist he watched that free, 
galloping figure. 

The girl wore a broad-brimmed 
hat. Her costume was mannish in 
other ways, and yet, oddly enough, 
there was that about her which made it 
feminine to the last degree. 

Bremerton was still staring as she 
drew close. Their eyes met through 
the dusty window. She smiled and 
waved a gauntleted hand. His face 
grew stony with the dark thoughts 
that suddenly surged within him. 

He did not get up and leave the 
headquarters adobe to meet her. 

Whirling the chair to face the door, 
he watched while she dropped the 
reins, dismounted lightly and stepped 
across his threshold. 

“ Good morning,' Mr. Bremerton,” 
she said, still smiling. 

He noted the clear, soft, brown face, 
the comely roundness of the cheek, the 
arch of the throat, the Castilian lan¬ 
guor of the big, dark eyes. 

Moonlight has a magic of its own, 
but it could not add to the charms of 
Mariquita Mallory. There, in broad 
day, she was infinitely more attractive 
than when Bremerton had seen her 
among the cottonwoods. 

“Why don’t you say something?” 
queried the silvery voice. “Am I 
welcome, or am I not? ” 

Like dagger thrusts the words of 
Lacey pierced Bremerton’s brain. 
When she smiled I found my danger 
greatest! And Mariquita Mallory 
was smiling. 

“ I told you,” said Bremerton, “ to 
keep away from me.” 

“ You couldn’t have meant it 
though,” she laughed, “ not really.” 
She dropped her- head on one side and 
looked at him critically. 

“ You’re in much better shape than 
when I say you last. Weren’t you 
glad I made you take Silverheels and 
ride to the hotel? And you’ve never 
said gracias. Perhaps I’ve come to 
give you the chance to say that.” 

“Then I thank you for something 
which I do not look upon as an obliga¬ 
tion,” he returned. 

“ That is gratitude with a string 
tied to it.” She laughed. “ But no 
matter. When we’re better ac¬ 
quainted, Mr. Bremerton, I think 
you’re going to like me. I don’t mind 
saying that I’m rather predisposed ia 
your favor already. I know what 
you hare done here—how you clipped 
the spurs of Big Steve and winged 
Chombo. You’ve made a very good 
beginning, Mr. Bremerton. Are you 
willing to listen to me? ” 

“ If you’re going to say anything 
against Deane—” 


The black eyes kindled, the smile 
faded and left the lips stern. 

“ I am—just that,” she cut in. 

“ Then I am not going to listen to 
you.” 

He got slowly out of his chair, and 
approached her. 

“ Miss Mallory,” he went on, “ you 
are a woman, a very beautiful woman, 
and you are not going to make me for¬ 
get that I am a man and fighting a 
man’s fight. It is a fight that I shall 
win. 

“ You and your father are Deane’s 
enemies. I have reason to believe that 
you fight Deane’s friends from cover, 
with a reckless disregard of life and 
consequences. 

“ But you and your father are not 
going to stand in my way. Take my 
advice and leave this part of the 
country before I bring home to you 
something which will call for a penalty. 
Save yourselves while there is time.” 

There was interest in her eyes and 
she did net seem displeased. 

“ You are taking the wrong trail,” 
she returned earnestly. “ I can ex¬ 
plain that to you, if you will let me. 
You cannot afford to make a mistake, 
Mr. Bremerton—a mistake so hideous 
and far-reaching as this of yours is 
bound to be. Let me tell you—” 

“Not a word. Miss Mallory, you 
must know I could not believe you.” 

“ You have been talking with Mr. 
Lacey? ” 

“ Naturally I saw him as soon as I 
could after reaching Phoenix. That 
is no secret to you or your father. I 
was spied upon from the moment I 
left the train. Otherwise, that gang 
of hoodlums would not have been 
ready for me.” 

His voice was tinged with bitter¬ 
ness. She stepped back and her eyes 
began to glow again. 

“ I have told you we had nothing to 
do with that villainous attack upon 
you! ” she cried. 

He waved his hand * 

“ I have a fair amount of r«aso» 
and judgment,” he replied, “ and you 


had best give me credit for that right 
from the beginning.” 

“ Deane will never be able to ac¬ 
complish anything here,” she declared 
sharply, “ no matter who takes up the 
work for him. I should hate to see 
you go the way Griggsby went or 
suffer as Lacey has suffered. I want 
to help you! ” 

“ Then keep hands off. Call away 
your gang. By doing that, you will 
not only help me but help yourself a 
good deal more.” 

“We want peace, but not at that 
price. If it is to be war between you 
and my father and me, it is war of 
your own bringing.” 

“ Call it what you will, I am here 
to serve Deane.” 

“ Then you are serving a scoun¬ 
drel ! ” she flamed. With a superb, 
dramatic gesture, she pulled the 
gauntlet from her left hand and flung 
it down in front of him. 

“ You will bring that back to me on 
your knees before you are done with 
the Mallorys! ” she cried, and whirled 
and ran from the office. 

He picked up the glove curiously, 
wonderingly, while the beat of her 
horse’s hoofs died swiftly away along 
the trail that led out of the valley. „ 

CHAPTER X. 

DOUBLE-DEAUNG. 

“Actress,” muttered Bremerton— 
“ actress to the core! ” He threw the 
small glove upon the table with an 
angry gesture. 

“ So I am to take that back' to her 
on my knees, am I ? ” 

He pictured himself crawling at the 
feet of Mariquita Mallory and humbly 
lifting that gage of battle which she 
had flung at him. A grim smile curled 
his lips. “ I wonder if she takes me 
for a coward or a sentimental fool ? ” 

He felt as though he had just come 
off the stage after taking part in a 
scene from a melodrama. His annoy¬ 
ance was keen, and he was surprised a 


moment later to find himself beside the 
table and again holding _the glove in 
his hands. 

The girl was two-faced; in his own 
mind there could be no doubt about 
that. And yet there was something 
undeniably attractive about her, some¬ 
thing winsome, appealing. 

He would have given a month’s pay 
to hear the truth in the matter of 
Deane’s deal for the Mariquita Mine. 
But from what unprejudiced source 
was the truth to come? Certainly 
not from the girl. 

Lacey had found her “ mosli 
dangerous when she smiled.” Bremer^ 
ton ground out an exclamation and 
crushed the glove in his strong fingers.; 

Unlocking a drawer of the desk he 
dropped Miss Mallory’s property into 
it, along with the ball of amalgam and 
the mended chamois skin, and turned 
the key on the collection. 

The gleaming ball reminded him 
that he had work to do, and he left the 
office and mounted the low incline that 
led to the mill. A man on the ore 
platform was shoveling rock into the 
crusher. The superintendent picked 
up a piece at random and examined it. 

It was fairly good ore, but not the 
kind that would make the Mariquita 
worth half a million dollars. He 
tossed the sample into the hopper and 
climbed through an opening in the 
rough board wall and descended three 
or four steps to the ore loft. 

The stamp-stems of the two bat¬ 
teries were lifting and falling with a 
force that shook the old mill in every 
part. 

The uproar was deafening, so close 
at hand. The crusherman was also 
the ore-feeder, and while he was busy 
on the platform outside Bremerton 
had the ore-loft to himself. Making 
his way between the batteries of 
dancing stamp-stems, he halted at the 
edge of the loft and looked down into 
the body of the mill. 

Directly beneath him were the mill- 
plates, covered with a thin sheet of 
flowing water. The water was stained 

with the powdered ore, washed away 
from the stamps and carried through 
the battery screen to the plates.' 

The quicksilver on the plates 
captured the gold from the muddy 
tide and held it fast. For one reason 
or another, a small quantity of the 
yellow metal would not “ catch,” and 
the water carried it out of the mill and 
away to the tailings piles. 

Giles, the batteryman, sat in the 
aisle between the plates, keeping a 
vigilant eye upon the boxes, and 
smoking as he watched. At the rear 
of the mill Big Steve leaned against 
a bench, tying a fresh cloth over the 
wide mouth of a bottle of “ quick.” 

Through the door leading into the 
engine room Bremerton could see the 
engineer — who was his own fireman 
—heaving crooked lengths of mes- 
quit and palo-verde into the fire-box. 

It was a scene of peaceful activity, 
and offered not the slightest hint of 
dishonest motives on the part of any 
of the workers. And yet, if there 
was a “ leak,” and if through it 
amalgam was dribbling away from 
Deane, then more than one man in 
that mill had a hand in the plot. 

Bremerton became suddenly aware 
that Big Steve had finished tinkering 
with the bottle of quicksilver and was 
looking upward at the edge of the 
ore-loft. A complacent, slightly con¬ 
temptuous grin creased the flabby face 
of the amalgamator. Bremerton met 
the uplifted glance quietly, and Big 
Steve dropped his eyes and shouted 
something to Giles. 

The batteryman bounded up the 
steps to the loft and began “ hanging 
up” the stamps. One by one, with a 
piece of board, he lifted each stamp 
in one of the batteries and left it hang¬ 
ing and idle. There is a knack in the 
work, and Giles proved his efficiency 
by doing it deftly and quickly. 

The roar of the mill was now de¬ 
creased by half, and Bremerton was 
able to compliment Giles without shout¬ 
ing at the top of his voice. Giles was 
minus an eye, but the eye that was 


left gleamed with pride as he listened 
to the approval of the new superin¬ 
tendent. 

If Big Steve had a confederate, 
Bremerton was sure it could not be 
Giles. He had not the air of a man 
with a guilty conscience. If there was 
any fault to be found with Giles, it 
’was because he could not see as much 
crookedness with one eye as he might 
have seen with his normal equipment. 

Bremerton descended a flight of 
narrow stairs to the body of the mill. 
Big Steve was just coming out from 
under the ore-loft, where he had been 
turning the water off from the battery. 

He pulled a stubby whisk-broom 
from his pocket and stepped to the side 
of the plate. “ Looking over the 
mill?” he asked of Bremerton casu¬ 
ally. 

Bremerton nodded. Big Steve be¬ 
gan passing the broom over the plate 
in wide, vigorous circles. The amal¬ 
gam ridged and loosened under the 
sweeping splints. Big Steve laid aside 
the broom and took a square of rubber 
from his coat. 

“ Cleaning up a little ? ” asked the 
new superintendent pleasantly. 

“ Got to,” was the reply. “ She«don’t 
stick. Liable to shuff off and ride out 
with the tailings in chunks.” 

Bremerton knew better. The amal¬ 
gam was safe enough and there was no 
need of removing any from* the plate. 
Big Steve was lying. This was part of 
his method in “ lifting” Deape’s gold. 

He pushed the rubber across and 
across the plate, molded two balls of 
amalgam in his hands and laid them 
aside oh a piece of chamois skin. After 
that he scattered quicksilver from the 
bottle upon the plate, dressed the plate 
down with the broom, called to Giles 
to start the stamps again and went into 
the little amalgamator’s room off the 
side of the mill. 

Bremerton followed and watched. 
Big Steve, by manner rather than 
words, seemed to consider his presence 
an intrusion. 

“ How many times a day do you 



make this partial clean-up, Bryden ? ” 
the superintendent asked. 

“ Four.” 

The amalgamator was gathering a 
ball up in the chamois. His big fists 
clamped down on it tight and the 
“ quick ” oozed through the skin and 
dropped into a bowl. 

“ Two balls each time? ” 

“ Gen’rally.” 

Big Steve removed the first ball, laid 
it on a shelf behind him, and then be¬ 
gan squeezing the second ball. Work¬ 
ing at the amalgamator’s back, Bremer¬ 
ton drew a knife from his pocket, 
opened the blade and, with its point, 
made a cross on the lower surface of 
the first ball of amalgam. The ma¬ 
neuver was entirely lost on Big Steve. 

“ I don’t reckon we’ll get two balls 
every partial clean-up this run,” said 
the amalgamator suddenly, as though 
his heavy wits had been struggling with 
Bremerton’s question and his own an¬ 
swer. “ Ore’s purty low-grade, com¬ 
pared with what it is usually.” 

Bremerton strolled out of the little 
room, across the body of the mill, 
through the engineer’s quarters and 
around to where King was working at 
the cyanid tanks. 

“ What does Bryden do with the 
amalgam he takes from the plates dur¬ 
ing the day, King? ” Bremerton in¬ 
quired. 

“ Turns it-over to me when he knocks 
off work in the afternoon,” was the 
reply. “ Night amalgamator does the 
same thing in the morning. Why?” 

‘‘Oh, nothing! I’m just getting the 
run of the details. After supper, this 
evening, bring Bryden’s amalgam to the 
office.” 

The little expert’s eyes widened. 

“ You don’t think for a minute that 
Big Steve—” he began, but the super¬ 
intendent cut him short. 

“ Don’t bother about what I think, 
King. Whatever it is, be sure it is noth¬ 
ing to your discredit. Just bring up 
the amalgam this evening—and keep 
the matter quiet.” 

Bremerton went back to the office 


and resumed his study of the Mariquita 
property as outlined on the map. 
Deane’s holdings comprised several 
claims, all known by the one general 
name, and completely filled the little 
valley and lapped over upon the hills 
that bordered it. 

Where was the bonanza ledge, the 
golden reef which had dazzled Deane 
while the mine was in the hands of 
Mallory or Carruthers? Bremerton 
could have sworn that it was some¬ 
where under that scoriated valley, and 
just as surely as it was there so surely 
would he one day discover it. 

For the rest of the morning and all 
the afternoon he smoked and reflected, 
the map under his eyes. His next step 
was to go over the property foot by 
foot and endeavor to locate the lost 
vein. Next day he would begin. 

Following supper, and after the day 
men had retired to their quarters and 
the night men had gone into mine and 
mill for their work, King came with a 
canvas bag and rolled four balls of 
amalgam out upon the office table. 

“ Is that all Big Steve turned in ? ” 
Bremerton inquired. 

“ Certainly,” replied King with a 
pained look. “ I hope, Bremerton, you 
don’t think I’d hold out anything on 
you?” 

“ Bosh! It’s not your trail I’m on. 
How does the ore now running through 
the mill compare in value with the ore 
of the last run ? ” 

“ It is almost identically the same, so 
far as value is concerned.” 

“And the amount milled is the 
same ? ” 

“ Yes.” 

“ Bryden says it is his practise to 
have a partial clean-up four times dur¬ 
ing his shift, and that generally he gets 
two balls of amalgam from each plate 
every time he takes the stuff off. Ac¬ 
cording to that, there should be sixteen 
balls of amalgam in this lot. Where 
are the other twelve ? ” 

King appeared astounded. 

“ He never turns in any more than 
this, Bremerton. Probably Big Steve 
is a bit hazy, yet, and didn’t realize 
what he was saying. Or you may have 
misunderstood him.” 

“ He was sober enough and I didn’t 
misunderstand him.” Bremerton 
looked at the balls. The one he had 
marked was not among them. “ Well,” 
he added presently, “ of all the brazen 
stealing I ever heard of, this is the 
limit.” 

He leaned back in his chair, peered 
into King’s startled face and laughed. 

“ What was the matter with Griggs- 
by and Lacey that they did not find the 
‘ leak ’ in the mill? ” he went on. “ It 
is so confoundedly simple that a blind 
man could locate it.” 

“ I’m not blind,” parried King. “ It 
got past me, Bremerton. And Griggs- 
by and Lacey worried their heads off 
about the failure of the clean-ups to 
tally with my assay figures.” 

“ Take the amalgam back and put 
it in the laboratory safe, King,” said 
the superintendent quietly. “ I’ll ex¬ 
plain matters to you later on. I know 
why the bullion doesn’t tally with your 
assays of the mill-run, but there are a 
few other things I don’t know and 
which I must find out as quickly as pos¬ 
sible. Keep your own counsel'. We’ll 
get to the bottom of this, and some¬ 
thing will drop, and drop hard, before 
many days. It’s a wonder, by glory, 
that this mine is doing as well as it is, 
everything considered.” 

King toqk his bag of amalgam and 
went back to the laboratory. He was 
sorely puzzled and half-inclined to 
doubt Bremerton’s statement regard¬ 
ing the discovery of the “ leak.” 

CHAPTER XI. 

THE MOUTH OE THE ARROYO. 

Of Griggsby, Bremerton knew little, 
but for Lacey, Bremerton cherished the 
respect which one man of resolution 
and ability will always feel for another 
of his kind. A square look was all 
Bremerton had needed to get Lacey’s 
measure. And how had it been possible 


for Big Steve, so clumsy and barefaced 
in his thieving, to pull the wool over 
Lacey’s eyes? 

The deeps of human nature are a 
tangle of mystery. Why or wherein 
Lacey had failed, or what he might ulti¬ 
mately have accomplished had he been 
left to go on with his work, Bremerton 
could not pretend to guess. But this 
matter of Big Steve and the missing 
amalgam had yielded so readily to in¬ 
vestigation that the blindness of Brem¬ 
erton’s predecessors — especially of 
Lacey—was a thing for wonder. 

Bremerton reflected that his very 
first day at the mine had given him a 
clue. That clue had infallibly involved 
Bryden. This advantage, however, did 
not tell the whole story of Griggsby’s 
and Lacey’s carelessness or incom¬ 
petence. 

“ It may be,” thought Bremerton, 
“ that Big Steve worked differently 
when Lacey was in charge. The truth 
may come out sometime. I can’t be¬ 
lieve that Lacey was so gullible as the 
developments seem to indicate.” 

He need not bother about Lacey. It 
was his own battle and not Lacey’s he 
was fighting. There was work to be 
done that night. 

Closing and locking the desk, he got 
up and walked into his sleeping room. 
When he came out into the main office 
he had the automatic pistol in his hand. 
He examined the weapon for a mo¬ 
ment under the light, then dropped it 
into his pocket. 

With a whiff down the lamp chim¬ 
ney he filled the room with darkness. 
A moment later he passed through the 
door and turned the key in the lock be¬ 
hind him. Moving on the bunkhouse 
through the gloom, he took up a posi¬ 
tion behind a heap of stones—a posi¬ 
tion from which he could watch the 
quarters of the sleeping day-shift. 

He wanted to be at the mill so that he 
.might test the night amalgamator as he 
had tested Big Steve. That part of his 
plans would have to wait, for the pres¬ 
ent. It was Big Steve’s trail he was fol¬ 
lowing, and he must run it out. 

There was no one abroad in the camp 
it that hour. The night men in the mill 
and in the underground workings had 
no cause to leave their posts. 

The blacksmith had pointed a supply 
of drills for those in the levels and 
stopes, and the teamsters had heaped 
the ore platform with plenty of rock 
for the stamps. 

Those of the camp who were not on 
duty slept while the mill roared and the 
ore gathered at the bottoms of the 
shafts. Bremerton ran no risk of dis¬ 
covery. 

Such risks as there were would come 
later, if the superintendent’s vague 
hopes were realized. Big Steve, sure 
of himself and careless in his villainy, 
was still the peg upon which Bremer¬ 
ton hung his plans. 

Where had Bryden put those twelve 
balls of amalgam? Even he would re¬ 
alize the danger of secreting them in the 
bunk - house. He would not let the 
night pass—so the superintendent rea¬ 
soned — without clearing away the 
evidence of his crookedness. 

The time dragged slowly. A less¬ 
ened clamor from the mill suggested 
the hanging up of a battery and the 
removal of amalgam from the plates. 
The night amalgamator was cutting his 
cloth according to Big Steve’s pattern, 
and all to the financial loss of Deane. 

The Mariquita Mine, it seemed, was 
being assailed from without and with¬ 
in. The Mallorys and their gang were 
not Deane’s sole enemies. There were 
traitors in camp with whom there must 
be a reckoning before a search-light 
could be turned on the methods of the 
Mallorys. 

“ All in good time,” muttered Brem¬ 
erton grimly, “ and meanwhile one 
thing at a time.” 

The old mill, crashing and clanging, 
gleaming yellow through every crack 
in the rough walls and pouring its 
smoke straight toward the stars, was 
a weird and fascinating object. 

It crouched on the crest of its little 
hill like some sulky, misshapen devil, 
growling as it gnashed at the ore and 


wheezing as it spewed the thick fog 
out of the tall, black stack. 

Bremerton was oddly attracted by 
that ramshackle structure, flaming and 
howling in the night. His eyes shifted 
from the mill to the bunk-house and 
back again almost continually. 

Perhaps he had been at the rock heap 
two hours, perhaps three, when a mov¬ 
ing blot emerged from the bunk-house 
shadows and glided toward the trail 
that led out of the valley. 

Bremerton chuckled. His vague 
hopes were being realized. As the 
shadowy blur lost itself behind the 
headquarters adobe and reappeared in 
the starlight beyond, he left his hiding 
place and cautiously followed. 

Once clear of the ruck of the camp 
the form from the bunk - house was 
thrown into clearer prominence. It 
was the form of a large man—Big 
Steve without a doubt—bearing a sack 
over his shoulder. 

The amalgamator followed the trail. 
Bremerton, more circumspect, dodged 
from one clump of greasewood to an¬ 
other at the trailside. 

At the top of the rise to the south, 
Big Steve turned directly out of the 
road and moved westward, along the 
ridge. Bremerton kept below the crest 
of the uplift. At a distance, it might 
have been, of a quarter of a mile, fte 
man with the bag descended the oppo¬ 
site slope and passed from sight. 

The mill-clamor was hushed so that 
the shrill cries of the coyotes could be 
heard. Creeping things, to which 
Bremerton gave no heed, scuttled out 
of his way. He looked down from the 
ridge-top upon a narrow level of desert, 
at the farther side of which were more 
hills and the mouth of an arroyo. 

Big Steve was laying a straight 
course for the arroyo. He paused once 
to emit a whistle. The signal was an¬ 
swered. Against the arroyo, black as 
a pocket, a point of light flared, flut¬ 
tered and died out. 

Bremerton crawled over the top of 
the ridge and, with redoubled caution, 
let himself down the slope. Here and 

there on the level were bits of chapar¬ 
ral. From screen to screen of bushes 
he moved and finally was as close to the 
mouth of the arroyo as he could go 
without inviting discovery. 

He heard a mumble of words. Big 
Steve was talking with some one whom 
he had met. A match was lighted, and 
the speck of fire hung over a pipe be¬ 
tween the amalgamator’s lips. Hardly 
a breath of air was stirring, and that 
faint glow did not waver. 

Big Steve sat on a boulder. The fig¬ 
ure beside him bent to pick up the bag 
he had carried from the bunk-house. 
The face of the stooping form came 
within the dim circle of light from the 
match. It was Chombo’s face, and the 
light glittered on the rings in his ears. 

There was a sling of white cloth sus¬ 
pended from the half-blood’s neck, and 
in the fold of it his right hand rested. 
There could not be the least doubt re¬ 
garding the identity of Chombo. 

Here was positive evidence of con¬ 
spiracy. Chombo had assisted Big 
Steve in his stealings while employed 
at the mine, and he was still active now 
that he had been discharged. 

How many of those rough workers 
at the mine were honest and loyal to 
Deane? The scene at the mouth of the 
arroyo suggested the question to Brem¬ 
erton, and he was in a mood to distrust 
every man in the camp except King. 

Where double-dealing was possible, 
owing to laxity of those in control, 
nearly every one would be found with 
a hand in it. It was up to Bremerton 
to make the thieving impossible. The 
first step to that end would be accom¬ 
plished by making object-lessons of 
Big Steve and Chombo. 

When the two in the mouth of the 
arroyo separated, the amalgamator re¬ 
turned toward the mill by the way he 
had come, and the half-blood faded into 
the dark of the narrow valley. 

Bremerton allowed Big Steve to go 
his way and pressed forward into the 
arroyo. His object was to discover, if 
he could, where the stolen amalgam 
;was taken by Chombo. 


In this he failed. Chombo had van¬ 
ished completely, and to prowl aimless¬ 
ly around in an attempt to locate him 
might have resulted in disaster to the 
superintendent. 

An examination of the arroyo could 
wait until the following day. The 
heavy gloom made a night search worse 
than useless. 

Bremerton started back towards the 
ridge. As he was climbing the slope, 
a rider galloped along the ridge-top, 
coming suddenly from nowhere and 
flinging along in the direction of the 
trail. 

His jaws clamped hard and his brows 
wrinkled as he stood and gazed. The 
rider was cut sharply in silhouette 
against the lighter background of the 
night sky. That swinging, graceful 
figure, the broad-brimmed hat, the flut¬ 
tering hair— He could not be mis¬ 
taken. It was Mariquita Mallory! 

The girl was swallowed up in the 
shadows as suddenly as she had ap¬ 
peared. Bremerton muttered angrily. 

Why was she there? Had she a 
part in that scoundrelly work at the 
mill? Was there really but one set of 
enemies fighting Deane? Were the 
foes within the camp linked in deviltry 
with those outside? Were they all 
working together to drive Deane out of 
that mining district ? 

Somewhere, deep down in Bremer¬ 
ton’s soul, lurked a sense of disappoint¬ 
ment. He realized that he had been 
hoping against hope that Mariquita 
Mallory, in the face of all that had 
happened, might be as inoncent of 
actual wrong-doing as she had pro¬ 
fessed to be. But evidence was piling 
upon evidence to prove the contrary. 

Big Steve, the thief, had met Chom¬ 
bo, another thief, in the hills. The girl 
was there, not present at the meeting, 
but handily by, to take from Chombo 
the bag of stolen amalgam. Quite 
likely the bag lay across the saddle in 
front of her as she galloped away. 

“ She’ll not make a fool of me as she 
did of Lacey,” Bremerton growled. 

He had said that before. Why was 
he harping on it ? Did he feel himself 
slipping and was he unwittingly ma¬ 
king a stand against an event alto¬ 
gether possible ? 

His spirit was up in arms against 
himself. While climbing the slope and 
striding along the ridge his thoughts 
circled around ways and means for 
gathering both Mallorys in the same 
snare he was preparing for Big Steve 
and Chombo. 

“If she’s in this,” he vowed, “ she’ll 
pay for it. I warned her. Whatever the 
cost, these foes of Deane’s are to be 
put out of business. They can’t wipe 
me out before I’ve had my way with 
them.” 

When he had got back to the head¬ 
quarters adobe and had locked himself 
in the stuffy rooms, he lpoked at his 
watch and found that it was two 
o’clock. His work for the next day, 
and for many days to follow, was cut 
out for him. It was time he was in 
bed. 

His thoughts, however, gave him no 
rest. He fumbled for his keys and 
started to open the drawer containing 
the ball of amalgam and the other 
things, and angrily caught himself up 
short. 

“ What do I want to look at that 
stuff for? ” he mentally asked himself. 
And he had no logical answer for the 
question. 

The Mallorys were hand-in-glove 
with the amalgam thieves. Otherwise, 
how it was that he found that first ball 
of amalgam on the scene of his strug¬ 
gle by the Phoenix town ditch? 

“ She’s as guilty as the r€st of 
them! ” he muttered savagely. 

With that conclusion firmly in mind 
he dismissed the whole subject of his 
night’s work and went to bed. 


CHAPTER XII. 

ENTER MICHAEE O’HARA. 

The entrance of Michael O’Hara 
upon the gloomy scenes of this chron¬ 
icle was excellently timed for Bremer¬ 


ton. A sordid struggle, inspired by the 
greed of men, blackened by treachery 
and tragedy, and with a plaintive note 
of injustice to some one somewhere 
ringing through it all, needs the touch 
of an O’Hara to renew faith in the 
fitness of things as they are. 

He should have been “ played on ” 
with a rollicking quickstep, but not too 
wild, not too clashing. A nocturne, 
perhaps, in two-four time, dreamy in 
places, but with here and there a laugh 
at the world for its follies. 

Mostly the strings, if you please, 
with a lilting of the wood-wind, and 
once or twice — but no more — the 
drums and the brasses. That was the 
spirit of the O’Hara, the soul of him. 

But there was trouble in setting it to 
music. For this reason, may bp, he 
chose personally to express himself 
through his own flute. 

He came suddenly. It was a habit 
he had. And gently and unobtrusively. 
That was another habit. 

Bremerton had first discovered him 
in the desert. His burro was dead, his 
food and water were gone. With his 
back to a sahuara cactus, he was wait¬ 
ing for the Reaper—waiting and try¬ 
ing to breathe out his soul through the 
flute with “ The, Harp That Once 
Thro’ Tara’s Halls.” 

For two years after that he and 
Bremerton were inseparable. They 
found gold, those two, but it was the 
gold in each other’s heart. They strug¬ 
gled, they starved, they broke rock and 
ripped holes in the flinty earth, and 
they sfettled down at last to sink a shaft 
on the “ Light of Hope,” their only 
find. 

But the light went out and hope died 
and they, had a hole in the ground for 
their pains. Between two days O’Hara 
decamped, leaving a note and sixteen 
silver dollars for Bremerton. 

The note said briefly: “ I’d fight for 
you, I’d die for you; but all hell can’t 
make me saddle you longer with the 
cursed luck of the O’Haras.” 

The sixteen dollars were all he had 
in the world. And when he went it 
was afoot, leaving the burro and all 
the meager grub-pack for Bremerton. 
High and low Bremerton searched 
for him, but whenever O’Hara effaced 
himself he did it thoroughly. No trace 
of the Irishman could Bremerton find. 

For many a month after that Brem¬ 
erton’s heart was sore. O’Hara had 
come into his life shortly after Deane 
had gone out of it, and the flute-play¬ 
er’s loss was a blow. 

The friendship of the right man for 
another who is right is one of the 
greatest gifts of God. And it never 
ends, here or hereafter. 

On the morning after his night’s 
work in the hills Bremerton was wa¬ 
kened by soft music outside his door. 
Thrilled, he sat up on the cot and 
greedily drank in the melody. He was 
happy, but he was not precipitate. The 
ways of the man outside were known 
to him and he deferred to them. 

To the strains of “ Mollie O ” he got 
up deliberately and put on his clothes. 
When he was quite ready he went into 
the outer office and unlocked and 
opened the door. 

A hatless man with red hair sat on 
his door-step playing a flute. Not by 
the wildest flight of fancy could the 
man be called handsome. His nose 
was short and his upper lip was long. 

His eyes were a washedout blue, 
and while one of them looked straight 
at you the other surveyed the land¬ 
scape. He was lean and long; doubled 
up as he was, his knees all but touch¬ 
ing his chin, his length was painfully 
in evidence. 

But he was comfortably clad. In 
fact, his whole appearance radiated 
prosperity. It was not an effusive 
prosperity, but an ample amount for 
creature comforts. 

With one eye fixed on Bremerton 
and the other looking around the cor¬ 
ner of the adobe, he continued his 
playing. Bremerton took a chair and 
sat down. 

After “ Mollie O ” had been played 
up and down and across, with trills and 
variations and the chorus three times 


repeated, the player took the flute from 
his lips and pushed it into a new, green 
cloth bag. 

“ Come in, O’Hara,” said Bremer¬ 
ton calmly. “ I owe you sixteen dol¬ 
lars.” 

“ Divil a cent do you owe me,” and 
the wide mouth of O’Hara opened in 
a roar of laughter. “ I’m owing you a 
thousand this minute, Bremerton, and 
no one has been able to see me for dust 
in the rush I’ve made looking for you. 
Luck’s changed a little, a very little, for 
O’Hara, or I’d never have ventured to 
run onto your trail. The debt, you 
mind, could have been canceled by 
post.” 

He pulled himself up from the step, 
shook his angular frame, and came in¬ 
to the little room. Twisting a package 
of bank-notes out of an inside pocket, 
he flung it to Bremerton. 

“Well, by glory!” Bremerton 
stared at the money as though hypno¬ 
tized. 

“ A thousand plunks! ” said O’Hara, 
grinning. “ Count ’em.” 

“ Where have you made a raise, 
Mike? And why in blazes am I en¬ 
titled to a share in it ? ” 

“ So you’ll be lookin’ a gift horse 
in the mouth, will you? Shame on 
you for tryin’ to dodge good money at 
the hand of a friend 1 It’s no safe 
I’ve been crackin’, no strong-arm 
work in it at all, at all. 

“ Och, my boy, you could never 
guess. We thought it a limestone 
stringer, with not much under the 
grass-roots but heartache and disap¬ 
pointment. Sure, we never made a 
bigger mistake. 

“ Lee, the old Light o’^Hope has 
made good to the chune of a couple 
of thousand. By the same token, your 
half is there in that wad. Now will 
you behave ? ” 

Bremerton looked incredulous. 
O’Hara hastened to explain. 

“ This is the way of it, and on my 
soul you can’t be more surprised than 
I was when the miraculous truth hit 
me in the face. ’Tis six months gone 

since I was near that God-forsaken 
spot where we lived and labored and 
lost faith. I went to see' that beautiful 
hole over which we’d cracked our 
backs, and — will you believe me ? — 
it was deeper than when we left 
it, and a bit of a cross-cut had been 
run, and six men were takin’ out ore 
that would have made your eyes bulge. 
The claim had been jumped, So help 
me. And why not, with no assessment 
work done for a year? Oh, the fools 
we were not to be thinkin’ of that 
cross-cut! ” 

Bremerton was dumfounded. And 
yet he need not have been. Occasion¬ 
ally such things are happening in the 
mining country, and as long as men 
dig for gold they will continue to hap- 
pen. 

“But the two thousand?” said 
Bremerton. “If the claim was jumped, 
I don’t see why the newcomers had to 
buy it.” 

“ ’Tis there the laugh comes in,” 
proceeded O’Hara, crinkling his 
crossed eyes. “ It was in my name, do 
you mind, and you had a quitclaim to 
half. My location was filed, but you 
hadn’t taken the trouble to file your 
quitclaim. They knew of me, those 
claim-jumpers, and they imagined 
trouble where none could be made, and 
gave me the two thousand to sheer off. 
I got it without passin’ my hat! ” and 
he wrapped his long legs around the 
chair and nearly choked with mirth. 

Never before for Bremerton had 
fortune gone to such lengths to give 
him a bit of a smile. He appreciated 
the humor of it, yet, if he had not, the 
wild joy of O’Hara would have forced 
a laugh out of sheer sympathy. 

“ The best part of it, Mike,” said 
Bremerton, “ is that luck has turned 
for you.” 

“ Faith,” was the response, “ the 
longest lane is bound to have a turn. 
Not being able to turn for the worse, 
it had to be for the better. As soon 
as I had the money in my jeans I set 
off looking for you. The divil’s own 
chase you led me. 


“ Here you were grub-stakin’ for a 
month in the hills, and there you’d 
come in, with your chuck gone and the 
burro no more than skin and bones. 
Maybe it was carpenter work you did, 
or clerkin’ in a store, or drivin’ stage 
until you’d amassed enough capital for 
another pasear in the wilds. 

“ Och, lad, but you’re a "hard one to 
come up with when the gold fever’s 
in you and the heart of you cryin’ for 
the lonesome trails! But I kept along 
until I found the place where you 
skinned yourself of your property to 
buy a ticket to Denver. Then I knew,” 
and the smiling face went long and the 
faded, mismatched eyes grew dull. “ I 
knew, by my soul, that you’d knuckled 
under to Deane.” 

O’Hara had no use for Deane. An 
honest Irishman, no matter if he is 
out at elbows, will think of his cod- 
science twice for every once you men¬ 
tion a pirate. 

“ Only,” continued O’Hara, “ I 
wished to High Heaven I’d got to you 
with the thousand in time. For what 
have you sold yourself, Lee? A para¬ 
graph in the papers let me know you 
were here, and that Deane had hired 
you to lay out this property butter- 
side up. What was the price? ” 

A grim smile flickered across the 
other’s lean face. 

“If you think I’ve sold my birth¬ 
right for a mess of pottage, Mike,” 
said hd, “ you’ll have to guess again. 
Now listen. I’m going to tell 'you 
something I’d confide to no other liv¬ 
ing soul, and I want you to get it 
straight.” 

He went into his arrangement with 
Deane exhaustively. Not only that, 
but he followed his own trail down 
from Denver, to the hospital with La¬ 
cey, to the cottonwoods by the Phoenix: 
town canal, to the mine, and, at last, 
to the mouth of the. arroyo. 

Bremerton could speak to O’Hara as 
to no one else. His beliefs, his hopes, 
his intentions were all laid naked be¬ 
fore the eyes of his friend. He had 
no need to tell of his confidence in 


Deane, for that tingled in every word 
of his talk. 

But he did declare his black sus¬ 
picions of Mariquita Mallory, and 
there was a false note struck again 
and again as he emphasized his convic¬ 
tions. O’Hara loved to drink in the 
music, but he hated the discord. 

“ Man, dear, but you’re out of 
chune! ” and he wabbled his red head 
gruesomely. “ The girl is a fiend, of 
course. Didn’t Lacey say so? He has 
judgment and penetration, although, 
to be sure, he couldn’t find the hole in 
the mill where the amalgam ran out; 
but that was simple, and Lacey’s eye 
was all for complications. It’s human 
nature and bitter true that we’d rather 
take a week hunting for something 
than travel ’cross lots for an hour and 
pick it up. 

“ But if there was any doubt o’ the 
girl’s duplicity, you settled it-. Beyond 
a shadow of surmise, in the twice you 
talked with her and the once you saw 
her gallopin’ through the night you 
smoked out her true char-ac-ter. 

“ Oh, the black trick she played on 
you there by the town ditch! Forced 
her horse on you at the muzzle of a 
gun—made you ride when you could 
not walk—bullied you into a comfort¬ 
able trip back to your hotel! s Troth, 
I’m in hopes to be spared till I can get 
even with her for that. 

“ It was worse, though, when she 
came here and wanted to be -friends. 
You were right in not letting her speak 
of the mine or give .you the whys and 
wherefores of the sorry-work that has 
been going on here. She might have 
exploded some dynamite under that 
trust you have in Deane. 

“Then what? No matter. Where’s 
the glove? Begorry,” and a wry smile 
came into the homely face, “ I’d like 
to take it back to her myself and tell 
her a few things. Bremerton, I’ve a 
mind to camp down on you for a while. 
You need me. But I’ll be no dead¬ 
head; I’ll work.” 

“ But you don’t understand—” 

“ I understand more than you think. 


Before long there’ll be more broken 
heads in these diggin’s than there ever 
was at a Donnybrook fair. For one 
of my disposition the outlook is dis¬ 
tinctly allurin’. I’m going to work 
here.” 

“Where are you going to work?” 
laughed Bremerton. 

“ In the mill. About to-morrow 
you’ll be needing a new amalgamator, 
and I’m the man for the job.” 

“Then that’s settled, and I could 
ask nothing better. There goes the 
gong at the chuck-shanty, Mike. Come 
on to breakfast.” 


CHAPTER XIII. 

THE HAND OF THE LAW. 

Bremerton planned a surprise for 
Big Steve and Chombo. The law was 
to be invoked against them and the 
case relentlessly pressed. Such a move 
would constitute an object lesson for 
all the enemies of Deane. 

King was sent to Phoenix directly 
after breakfast to-communicate Brem¬ 
erton’s plans to the sheriff. As a cover 
to the real nature of his errand, it was 
given out in camp that he had gone 
to town for a couple of carboys of 
sulphuric acid. 

In looking over the odds and ends 
of equipment in the office the superin¬ 
tendent had found an old dark-lantern. 
He had the lantern cleaned and filled 
by Wun Sing and made ready against 
the night’s operations. 

At ten o’clock in the evening Brem¬ 
erton and O’Hara quietly slipped out 
of camp and made their way along the 
trail to the top of the ridge. Three 
men were waiting for them on the 
ridge-crest—Ransom, the sheriff, and 
two deputies. 

“ I’m „ mighty glad,” said Ransom, 
after a few minutes’ talk, “ that some¬ 
thing is going to be done out here. 
Thugs and plug-uglies have been do¬ 
ing about as they please at the Mari¬ 
quita, and the law has had blamed 
little to work on. 


“Th'e Sneaking coyotes have cov¬ 
ered theft? tracks well, and even when 
Griggsby went I couldn’t lay hold of 
the first thing in the shape of a clue. 

“ The coroner’s verdict, that he 
‘ met his death at the hands of some 
person or persons unknown,’ still 
stands. It’s a blot on the good name 
of this county and this mining district; 
but now, with your help, I’m in hopes 
to accomplish something.” 

“ There’ll be a clean-up, Ransom,” 
declared Bremerton shortly, “ and you 
can gamble on that. Where did you 
leave your horses ? ” 

“ We’ve got a buckboard back a 
ways on the trail.” 

“ You understand the scheme. Cap¬ 
tain Bryden and the half-breed is only 
part of it; in addition to that, we’ve 
got to recover the stolen amalgam.” 

“ I get you. Maybe your idea will 
work, and maybe it won’t; but we’ll 
try it out.” 

All five of them pushed into the 
chaparral at the trailside. The night 
wind rustled the greasewoodT>ranches, 
and as it rose and fell the muttering 
of the mill rose and fell with it. The 
clear-cut stars gleamed in the sky like 
scattered diamonds, and only beneath 
them the trail was a lone, whitish blur 
and the ridge-top a shadowy stretch 
of brush-clumps and massed boulders. 
An hour dragged, and then— 

“What’s that?” whispered Ran¬ 
som in Bremerton’s ear. “ It’s a horse, 
and coming from the wrong direc¬ 
tion.” 

“ Wait—don’t make a move.” 

The galloping came close and a 
horse and rider paused within a dozen 
feet of those in the chaparral. Rising 
in the stirrups the rider looked over 
into the valley for a moment, peering 
and listening; then, with a sharp turn 
to the right, was off and out of sight 
along the ridge. 

“ A woman, by thunder! ” mur¬ 
mured the amazed sheriff. He swore 
under his breath. “ Is there a woman 
mixed up in this, Bremerton ? ” he de¬ 
manded. 


“ How do I know who’s mixed up 
in it?” returned the superintendent 
fretfully. “ There are others besides 
Big Steve and Chombo, I suppose, and 
maybe to-night will give us a line on 
them.” 

With one hand he touched O’Hara. 
The latter was sitting comfortably, his 
long knees hunched to his chin and 
his hands clasped around them. He 
laughed softly but said not a word. 

The Irishman’s tide of sentiment 
had set in toward Mariquita Mallory. 
This weakness of the girl’s for night¬ 
riding, and at times when the nights 
were bedeviled with treachery, had 
in timely fashion been brought home 
to O’Hara. Bremerton expected sur¬ 
prise and consternation. His expec¬ 
tations had been met with a laugh that 
expressed unreasoning, unshaken 
faith. 

Another hour dragged, and then 
through the deep, rolling diapason of 
the mill a sliding foot whispered in 
the sand. A dark figure was climbing 
out of the valley, a sack over the 
shoulder. 

“ Get ready! ” said Bremerton to the 
sheriff. 

A tense moment followed. Ransom 
took something from his pocket and 
rose crouching to his feet. Bremer¬ 
ton brought the lantern around in 
front of him and made ready to open 
the shutter. 

The figure won to the top of the 
trail and turned toward the length of 
the ridge. In that moment the 
shutter clicked and an eye of light 
streamed from the bushes. Big Steve 
whirled with a gasp in his throat. The 
bag dropped and he stood blinking in 
the< glare. Then a hand swept under 
his coat toward his hip. 

“ None of that! ” The bushes 
crashed and Ransom landed heavily in 
the trail. “ I’ve got your number, 
Bryden, and here’s where you lose. 
Bring that hand back in front of 
•you! ” 

The hand came back, but with steel 
glittering in the lantern-light. The 

amalgamator, at bay, would have 
made a fight of it, even against such 
odds. O’Hara’s long body shot clear 
of the chaparral as though propelled 
by springs, and with the swiftness of 
lightning he caught the steel and tore 
it away. 

“That pulls his fangs for him,” 
remarked O’Hara, stepping back. 
“ He has no sense at all or he’d know 
when he’s trapped.” 

“ What’s this ? ” puffed Big Steve. 
“ Who’s stoppin’ me? ” 

“ The sheriff,” replied that official 
briskly. “ Andy! ” 

Both deputies were out of the 
bushes by then, and Andy hurried to 
the prisoner with a pair of handcuffs. 
Big Steve showed his mettle and his 
desperation and began a wild fight 
against the inevitable. 

“ Leave him to me,” said the flute- 
player, and caught the thick, hairy 
wrists. 

With a strength no one but Brem¬ 
erton knew he possessed, O’Hara 
slowly but surely. brought the hands 
of the prisoner together in . front of 
him. 

“ Don’t be in a rush with those 
come-alongs, Andy,” cautioned 
OHara. “ Bremerton wants his coat, 
do you mind. There’s another one to 
be dealt with.” 

The words caused Big Steve to 
remember Chombo, and he lifted a 
roar of warning. The other deputy 
came up behind and slapped a hand 
over the prisoner’s mouth. 

“ Off with the coat,” said Bremer¬ 
ton, bringing the light closer. “ I 
don’t think the yell caused any harm.” 

With the sheriff’s help the coat 
was stripped from the amalgamator’s 
shoulders and the handcuffs snapped 
in place. Bremerton put on the coat 
over his flannel shirt, and picked up 
a black slouch hat that lay in the 
trail. 

“ Take him off to the wagon,” he 
went on the deputies. 

A twisted handkerchief was tied 
between Big Steve’s jaws as a precau¬ 


tion against any further use . of his 
voice, and the two men half dragged 
and half carried him along the road. 

Ransom borrowed the lantern and 
turned its light into the open mouth of 
the sack. 

“ Caught him with the goods, all 
right! ” There was a throb of satis¬ 
faction in his husky voice. “ Bremer¬ 
ton, we’ve a dead open and shut so 
far as that fellow is concerned.” 

“ We’ll get the others in the same 
way,” was Bremerton’s response. 

“ There’s only one more, Lee,” put 
in O’Hara quietly. “ Make sure.” 

“ We will make sure of it, Mike.” 
Bremerton stuffed his own hat in the 
front of his coat and put on Big 
Steve’s. “ We’ve got to proceed care¬ 
fully, from now on, if we locate the 
amalgam.” He picked up the bag and 
threw it over his shoulder. “ Shut off 
the lantern,” he added, “ and follow 
well in the rear.” 

“ Wait a bit.” O’Hara stepped 
closer to his friend. “ This is the part 
of your scheme, Bremerton, that has 
little appeal to me. The breed may 
think you’re Bryden for a few mo¬ 
ments, but how will this play get you 
the location of. the amalgam? If you 
think you can act the part of Steve 
and get Chombo to talk, then you’re 
far wide of your trail. Again, sup¬ 
pose Chombo heard that yell of Big 
Steve’s? If he did, he’ll be waiting 
and ready for you.” 

“ Chombo will be in the dark of the 
arroyo,” explained Bremerton. “ We 
can’t hide out and wait for him, as 
we did for Steve, and the three of us 
can’t approach the mouth of the 
arroyo without arousing the breed’s 
suspicions. There’s a flat to cross, 
and practically no cover. This is the 
only move we can make that will lay 
Chombo by the heels, and I may get a 
tip regarding the amalgam.” 

“ And you may get something more 
than you expect,” muttered O’Hara. 

“ Not from Chombo. He has only 
one good hand.” 

“ Well, go ahead,” cut in the sheriff 

impatiently. “ Whatever happens, 
Bremerton, we’ll be at your back.” 

The superintendent started along 
the ridge. Indistinct as he was in the 
starlight Chombo might easily mistake 
him for Steve Bryden. 

Following the route the amalga¬ 
mator had taken the previous night, 
Bremerton descended the slope, 
crossed the little plateau and paused 
only to give the whistle signal. 

The signal was answered, and he 
advanced swiftly to the arroyo’s 
mouth. A figure disentangled itself 
from the gloom, as the superintendent 
dropped the bag and seated himself 
on a boulder, a stealthy figure that 
crouched forward only to halt warily 
and at a safe distance. 

“ Steve ? ” questioned a voice. 

“ Yes,” answered Bremerton. 

The word was lost in a report, and 
fire flashed in the mouth of the 
arroyo. Bremerton gasped, swayed 
and slowly sank downward at the 
side of the boulder. 

A wild laugh burst from Chombo. 
His form straightened and he plunged 
forward. Ransom and O’Hara could 
be heard stumbling across the flat, 
coming uncertainly but at speed, each 
with his own forebodings about Bre¬ 
merton. 

Chombo bent and grabbed for the 
bag of amalgam. In the same instant, 
Bremerton’s arms went around him. 

“Thought you had me, eh?” 
growled Bremerton. “ Not that 
time! ” 

The two were struggling when 
Ransom and O’Hara came up. In 
short order the half-blood was flung 
to the ground and pinned there by 
the sheriff. 

“Lee,” asked O’Hara anxiously, 
“ how bad is it ? ” 

Bremerton laughed. 

“ Chombo knew something was 
wrong,” he answered, “ and some one 
was handily by to pick me off. But 
the shot went wide.” 

“ Och, you schemer! ” chuckled 
O’Hara, mightily relieved. “ You 


dropped, and the breed rushed for the 
sack. Then you nailed him. It was 
well done, for I thought in my soul 
you had followed Griggsby.” 

“ Good work,” said Ransom ap¬ 
provingly. “ Chombo,” he added to 
his surly captive, “ I’m the sheriff, arid 
you’re under arrest. We have your 
confederate, Bryden. Now, where's! 
the loot? I’m making no promises* 
but it will surely not go harder with 
you if you tell us about the amalgam.’*, 

“ You’ll let me go if I give ye the; 
amalgam?” panted the half-blood. 

“ No. You may help yourself, 
though, if you make a clean breast of 
this.” 

There was a brief silence, during 
which Chombo seemed to be thinking. 

“ Get off,” he gasped, “ let me 
breathe. You hurt my arm.” 

Ransom groped through Chombo’s 
clothes for weapons, . confiscated a 
knife, and finally got to his feet. 

“ The lantern, O’Hara,” said he. 

The yellow gleam fixed itself upon 
the form of Chombo, and undef the 
threatening muzzle of the sheriff’s 
gun he struggled to his feet. 

CHAPTER XIV. 

UNDER THE ADOBE WALE. 

“You did this!” said Chombo be¬ 
tween his teeth. His black eyes, 
gleaming with hate, turned on Bre¬ 
merton. “ Some day I am going to 
kill you! ” 

“ That’ll do you,” came sharply 
from Ransom. “ Better think of your¬ 
self, Chombo. It’ll be some years 
before you’re foot-loose and able to 
camp on anybody’s trail. What about 
that loot ? ” 

The half-blood swore softly and 
shifted his arm to a more comfortable 
position in the sling. 

“What can I do?” he complained 
fiercely. “ You are three and I am 
only one. I’ll take you where you can 
find the amalgam.” 

“ How far is it ? ” 


“Half a mile, maybe.” 

“ Just a minute,” put in Bremer¬ 
ton. “ Who fired that shot from the 
arroyo? ” 

“ Carramba! Some things I tvill 
not tell. That is one.” 

“ It’s clear enough to me, anyhow.” 

“ The girl on the horse ? ” queried 
the sheriff. . 

“ Easy, easy,” cautioned O’Hara.' 
“ Facts are what we want, not 
guesses.” He whirled on Chombo 
and flung the light full in his evil face. 
“ Don’t add a lie to the rest o’ your 
misdoings,” said he, “ but tell us who 
shot at Bremerton?” 

Cunning flashed in the shifty black 
eyes. “ Senorita Mallory.” 

“ You spawn of the pit! ” cried 
O’Hara. “ I throw it back in your 
teeth. You’re too ready to tell when 
you swore you wouldn’t. The truth 
is not in you. If he’d lie about one 
thing, Ransom, he’d lie about two, and 
I would not go a step with him to 
find this amalgam.” 

“ We’ll give him a chance to make 
good,” answered the sheriff. “ If he’s 
got any black scheme in his mind, he’ll 
pay for it.” 

“ Come with me, that’s all,” said 
Chombo surlily. “ If you find I’m 
lyin’ you can make me pay.” 

“ He’s playing fair,” observed Bre¬ 
merton. “ Let’s be going.” 

With O’Hara on one side of him 
and Ransom on the other, Chombo led 
the searchers into the arroyo. For 
several minutes they stumbled through 
the darkness, then climbed a steep 
slope, traversed the length of a “ hog¬ 
back,” plunged downward into black¬ 
ness again, and came finally into a 
small canon. The walls were not high, 
and from somewhere ahead could be 
heard a drip, drip of water falling into 
a pool. 

A turn in the gulch brought them 
out on a flat covered with a sparse 
growth of oaks. They were now close 
to the dripping water, and a small 
house could be seen under the shadow 
of the trees. 


“ Oak Flats,” remarked Ransom, 
“ I know the place. The only water 
this side the Mariquita. Which way, 
Chombo ? ” 

“ The adobe barn back of the 
house,” said the prisoner. 

The small house was dark and 
still. Twenty yards away, backed up 
against the rugged gulch wall, stood 
the barn. A corral, fenced with 
okatea stakes braided with wire, was 
close to the barn. As they passed the 
corral a horse whinnied. 

“ Must be some one at home,” com¬ 
mented Bremerton. 

“ If so,” returned O’Hara, “ they’re 
in bed like honest folks. My word 
for it, this half-breed is muy nialo. 
I’d not be trusting him under oath.” 

“ Wait! ” snarled the prisoner. 

He conducted them around the side 
of the adobe barn, then kicked his 
foot against the base of the wall. His 
foot struck wood, and there was a 
hollow, resonant sound. 

“ Take away that board and look! ” 
hissed Chombo. “ Then tell me I’m 
a liar.” 

Bremerton dropped to his knees, 
and while the beam of light played 
over the base of the adobe wall he 
removed a square section of board. A 
cavity was revealed. He reached into 
it and fished up a ball of amalgam the 
size of his fist. 

“Tally one for the breed!” mut¬ 
tered Ransom. “ You’re right, Bre¬ 
merton; he’s playing fair. How much 
of the stuff is in the cache? ” 

With both hands Bremerton began 
scooping out the amalgam. The heap 
grew into a small mountain of 
frosted silver before he brought out 
the last ball and rose to his feet. 

“ As I figure it,” said he, “ the 
Mariquita mill has been systematically 
robbed since the days of Griggsby. 
There’s not a tenth of the stealings in 
that pile.” 

“ Figure some more,” came the 
sneering voice of the half-blood. 
“ Would all the amalgam be left in 
that' hole under the wall, or would it 

be taken away when there was enough 
to make it worth while, retorted, run 
into bars, and sold ? ” 

A' quick, light footfall was heard, 
at that moment, and the men turned. 
O’Hara shifted the gleam of the 
lantern, and the slender, erect figure 
of Mariquita Mallory was etched 
clearly against the somber background 
of the oaks. 

She came steadily, bravely on, her 
wide-brimmed hat pushed back and 
the rebellious tresses twisting about 
her forehead and throat. Her face 
was set in resolute lines. A quirt 
swung from her slender wrist, and her 
horse could be seen dimly in the 
distance. 

“ This is hardly a time for 
visitors,” said she. “ May I ask what 
you are doing? ” . 

O’Hara stepped forward. With a 
courtly gesture he removed his hat. 

“Miss Mariquita Mallory?” he in¬ 
quired in a voice as soft as any note 
of his flute. 

Her large eyes swerved to him won- 
deringly, and she inclined her head. 

“ And these are your premises, the 
place where you live?” 

“ Yes.” 

“ Then be so kind as to bear with 
the lot of us. The man there,” and he 
flashed the lantern upon the prisoner, 
“ has been caught takin’ goold from 
the Mariquita mill. He led us here, 
saying he’d show us where he’d cached 
some more of it. And, faith, he has. 
’Twas under the adobe wall. Bad cess 
to the blackguard for hiding his loot 
on the property of honest folks! ” 

The girl stood like a statue. Her 
gaze passed from O’Hara, encountered 
Bremerton, then fell on the sheriff, 
and finally rested on the pile of amal¬ 
gam. O’Hara threw the light from 
point to point as the wide, wondering 
eyes traveled over the oddly assorted 
group. 

“ That — amalgam — was found 
there, under the wall ? ” 

The words were quick and breath¬ 
less, and they ended in what was al¬ 


most a sob. A gloved hand arose to' 
the white throat and the fingers closed. 

“ Be sure, Miss Mallory,” said 
O’Hara hastily, “ you have nothing to 
fear at all.” 

“ Why — why should I have any¬ 
thing to fear ? ” 

“ You know me, I think, Miss Mal¬ 
lory,” spoke up Ransom with a touch 
of sternness. “ I’m the sheriff. If you 
can tell us anything about this half- 
breed, now is the time.” 

The hand dropped from the throat 
and the lithe figure straightened. The 
head went up, the shoulders back, and 
the girl faced the sheriff squarely. 

“ Has the half-breed told you any¬ 
thing about me ? ” she demanded. 

“ He says you shot at Bremerton 
from the arroyo, and he—” 

“ Man, man,” burst wildly from 
O’Hara, “ what was the need o’ that? ” 

With measured steps Mariquita Mal¬ 
lory approached Chombo, where he 
stood at Ransom’s side. Quick as 
thought her right hand flew up and the 
quirt fell stingingly across the half- 
breed’s face. With bosom heaving and 
eyes flashing she leaped back. 

“ Say it again! ” she cried. “ Here, 
before me, say it again! ” 

Hate and rage and pain twisted 
Chombo’s villainous face. 

“ Oh, will you say it? ” breathed the 
girl fiercely. “ There is no one to help 
Mariquita Mallory, no one but Mari¬ 
quita Mallory herself. A woman’s 
good name—what is that to a prowling 
dog in these hills? What is it to any 
of you? ” 

Her flaming eyes swept the faces of 
the nfen. “ Does it mean nothing to 
me, to be lied about, and slandered and 
my name made a by-word on the lips of 
honest men? Shame to you that you 
listen to the wretch, and double-shame 
that you leave it to me to drive the lie 
down his miserable throat. But I can 
do it.” 

She whirled back to Chombo again, 
and once more her arm went up and the 
quirt-thongs trailed over her shoulder. 
“ Was it true ? Answer! ” 

“No!” said the half-breed, and 
cowered with his good arm doubled be¬ 
fore his face. 

The excitement, the frenzy, went out 
of the girl in an instant. Her arm fell 
at her side and her body, seemingly 
spentjjy that gust of passion, drooped 
limply forward. 

“ Mr. Bremerton,” she murmured 
sadly, “ some day you will be sorry for 
all your suspicions; some day, if I can 
bear this long enough to make it clear 
to you. If that amalgam was stolen 
from the Mariquita mill and brought 
here, it was done for a purpose. That 
purpose was to bring nearer the jail 
with which you so gallantly threatened 
me that night by the town canal. 

“ This home,” she waved her hand 
about her, “ is my home and my fath¬ 
er’s—a mud hovel—the only place we 
can call our own. We should have bet¬ 
ter—some day we will have better, if 
we get justice and can live and fight till 
it comes. Do what you can, -Mr. Brem¬ 
erton,” she said scornfully, “ to cheat 
us out of our rights, but never again 
take the word of a half-breed thief 
against Mariquita Mallory.” 

A dead silence ensued when the girl 
had finished. Ransom was dum- 
founded, Bremerton amazed, and 
O’Hara humble and apologetic. It was 
the Irishman who first ventured to 
speak. • 

“ Miss Mallory, what you say goes to 
the heart of all of us. But, believe me, 
you have not the right of it. When the 
half-breed said what he did, I gave him 
the lie. And Bremerton—sure, you 
don’t know the heart of him yet. Some 
day, as you said, you’ll come into your 
rights, and on that day you’ll know Lee 
Bremerton as I know him.” 

A smile played about the girl’s full 
lips. 

“ You are Irish? ” she asked. 

“ All but the brogue,” he laughed. 

“ My father is Irish and my mother 
was Mexican ? ” 

“ And you think I didn’t guess ? 
Faith, your name was enough to tell me 
that.” 


“ You are a friend of Mr. Bremer¬ 
ton’s ? ” 

“ Friend ? That doesn’t tell the half 
of it. He saved me in the desert, and 
for two years we thirsted and starved 
together. Such a life does not make 
for friends, do you mind, but for 
brothers.” 

“ Then show Mr. Bremerton how 
wrong he is in his dealings with the 
Mallorys. That is the greatest kind¬ 
ness you can ever do him—and me! ” 

She pulled away her glove and 
reached out her right hand. O’Hara 
accepted it with a knightly courtesy. 

“ Trust me for that,” he answered. 

Mariquita once more faced the 
sheriff. 

“ Take that amalgam away with 
you,” said she. “ You will find ore- 
sacks in the barn.” 

With that, she left him, returned to 
her horse and led the animal toward 
the corral. They watched her until she 
had passed from sight.' 

“ So that’s old Mallory’s girl! ” mur¬ 
mured Ransom, in a bewildered tone. 
“ Hanged if I ever knew she had such 
a temper.” 

“Temper?” countered O’Hara. 
“ Not a bit of it. It’s spirit, fine and 
high, and nothing else.” 

“ She ought to be on the stage,” 
growled Bremerton; “ she’d make a hit 
as an emotional actress. But let’s side¬ 
track the heroics and get away. Give 
me the lantern, O’Hara.” 

O’Hara gave him the light without 
a word, and he went into the adobe barn 
to get the ore-sacks. 

CHAPTER XV. 

THE TEST. 

In due course, Dutch Fred bought, 
brought out from town and duly deliv¬ 
ered to Smear Case one dozen bags 
of smoking tobacco. 

“ I make no holler,” said Fred, “but 
I don’t got a fair shake.” 

“ Whyever didn’t you?” inquired 
Case. 
“ Dot Irish feller mit der crooked 
eyes come around since der bet. He is 
a masgot for Bremerton. I bet nodding 
against masgots. He is vat beat me 
oudt of dot smokin’, yah, so.” 

Case chuckled; and as he walked 
away loaded with tribute, he added in¬ 
sult to injury with this gem of song: 

“ It takes the Irish to beat the Dutch! 

What the Irish can’t accomplish it 
don’t amount to much! 

With your scientific tricks, 

You can never fool the Micks— 

You can bet your life the Irish beat 
the Dutch! ” 

For the first time since Deane had 
acquired the Mariquita Mine the prop¬ 
erty was more than paying expenses. 
This was a matter for congratulation, 
although it was not going far enough. 
It was no showing on which to effect 
a sale of the mine for half a million 
dollars. 

Bremerton’s task was to bring the 
output of bullion up to the bonanza 
point set by Mallory. He had un¬ 
earthed a file of Mallory’s bullion cer¬ 
tificates, and these he had compared 
with assays of rock from the lead on 
which the miners were now at work. 

The ore was different. Mallory had 
not worked out a rich “ pocket ” on 
the present vein. He had dug in vir¬ 
gin and bonanza ground. But where 
was it? 

While the camp was being reorgan¬ 
ized and shaken down to a commercial¬ 
ly profitable basis, Big Steve and 
Chombo had come to trial for the lar¬ 
ceny of the bullion and had been sen¬ 
tenced to the penitentiary. 

Between arrest and conviction a re¬ 
markably short time had intervened. 
And the sentences imposed were 
strangely inadequate 

Sinister influences had been at work 
in behalf of Big Steve and Chombo. 
A lawyer of prominence had managed 
their case, but he had hastened rather 
than checked the law’s course. 

As soon as his clients were finally be¬ 
hind the bars, it was known that he 
had begun disbursing small sums, as 


pensions, to the immediate families of 
the two men. 

Bremerton had hoped that one or 
both of the thieves would make a con¬ 
fession involving more of Dean’s ene¬ 
mies. In this he was disappointed. 
They held their peace and took their 
medicine, and Bremerton felt sure that 
somebody had made it worth their 
while. | 

Indirectly, it seemed certain that the 
convicted men were part of the strong 
and desperate organization that was 
fighting Deane. With this murderous 
and persistent gang Bremerton could 
not but connect the Mallorys. Abso¬ 
lute proof, however, was lacking. 

While Bremerton “ gophered ” and 
hunted for clues of the lost vein, and 
pestered his mind with doubts and 
theories in other directions, O’Hara 
cheerfully tinkered with the mill-plates 
and in off-hours played his flute. 

Apparently the Irishman had not a 
care in the world. Now and then he 
would drop in on the night amalgama¬ 
tor, in the small hours of the morning, 
exchange small talk with him and cov¬ 
ertly watch for dishonest work. 

But if the amalgamator on the night 
shift had been crooked, the fate of Big 
Steve had induced him to reform. 
This, which came nearer being a care 
for O’Hara than anything else, settled 
itself comfortably and left nothing on 
his mind. 

In Bremerton’s second month at the 
mine, at the close of a Monday after¬ 
noon, a Mexican boy rode up to the of¬ 
fice and asked for the superintendent. 

Bremerton was just coming in from 
a day’s fruitless quest for the lost vein, 
and the boy handed him a note, offered 
no explanation one way or the other, 
and immediately galloped away. 

Bremerton read the note and . smiled 
queerly. After supper that evening, 
while O’Hara was getting out his flute, 
the superintendent halted the music for 
a talk. 

“ What are you doing to carry out 
your part of the agreement, Mike?” 
Bremerton inquired suddenly. 

The other looked up blankly. 

“ It’s a rolling stone I am, and ut¬ 
terly irresponsible,” said he. “ What’s 
a contract to such a man? But you 
have me curious, Lee. What agree¬ 
ment is in your mind ? ” 

“ The one you made with Mariquita 
Mallory. You were to show me how 
wrong I am in my estimate of her and 
her father. Weeks have gone and you 
have not made a move ? ” 

O’Hara trilled a few notes, then laid 
the flute on his knee. 

“ Sure, it was an easy job, and I saw 
it from the start.' You’re makin’ no 
wrong estimates. What you say, Brem¬ 
erton, is one thing, and what you be¬ 
lieve, in that case, is another entirely.” 

“ You’re not giving me credit for be¬ 
ing honest.” 

“ I’m giving you credit for trying 
hard to be loyal to Deane.” 

“ We might as well thrash this out, 
Mike. Your attitude toward Mari¬ 
quita Mallory is so different from mine 
that it bothers me.” 

“ ’Tis not different at all,” and the 
.flute went to his lips while he ran the 
scale. 

“ There’s no use arguing with an 
Irishman.” 

“ Then why are you bothered ? ” 

Quizzing wrinkles showed around 
the twinkling, crossed eyes. Bremer¬ 
ton frowned and reached for a pigeon¬ 
hole of his desk. Removing a folded 
paper, he handed it to O’Hara and 
asked him to read it. . 

“ H-m,” said O’Hara. “ I’d give 
something handsome if such an invite 
could come to me. Did Lacey accept ? ” 

“ That’s the note from Mariquita 
Mallory,” explained Bremerton sharp¬ 
ly, “ that lured Lacey into a trap. On 
the way to make his call he was shot 
from cover. Only yesterday he left the 
Phoenix hospital, almost a wreck of a 
man, to go East and get back his 
strength.” 

“ Now, wasn’t that the divil’s own 
luck ? He couldn’t be shot cornin’ back, 
could he ? Not at all. He had to get 
it going, and that robbed him of a few 


blessed moments with the only woman 
I’ve ever seen who’s distinctly worth 
a man’s time. For me, now, I’d count 
it a pleasure to run the gantlet of a 
dozen ambushes just for a smile from 
the girl.” 

At that moment Bremerton was 
nearer to being out of patience with his 
friend than at any time since he had 
known him. 

Jumping to his feet, he strode up and 
down the office. Calmly the Irishman 
blew into the flute, and out of it came 
softly the air of “ Mollie O.” It was 
always a favorite in his more serious 
moments. 

Bremerton sat down again and wait¬ 
ed until he had finished. O’Hara took 
his time, and a smile came to his lips 
as he again favored his friend with his 
attention. 

“ Your fur was standing, Lee,” he 
remarked, “ and I thought it would 
calm you. You can’t stay mad at me, 
and you know it. Let matters drift. 
Before long you’ll be coming around in 
this Mallory business.” 

“ Here’s something else for you to 
read,” said Bremerton, handing him 
another note. 

O’Hara took the paper and read: 

Mr. Bremerton: 

You must listen to me now. You are 

in danger, and I can help you. Come 

to our house in the morning at eight. 

You will not be sorry if you do, for 

this time, trust 

Mariquita Mallory. 

“ Och, the luck you have when you 
don’t deserve it! ” commented O’Hara, 
his faded eyes glowing. “ The poor 
taste she has, sending for you when she 
might have sent for me.” 

He sighed heavily. “ But a red¬ 
headed freak who can’t look at a girl 
with both eyes at once mustn’t expect 
too much in this world! Bremerton, I 
congratulate you.” 

The superintendent leaned forward 
and stayed the hand that was reaching 
for the flute. 

“ Cut that out for now,” said he 
sharply. “ Do you understand this ? ” 

“ Perfectly. You’ll go, and the girl 
will be getting you out of one danger 
only to draw you into another. For 
the peace of my soul, I’d rather face a 
battery of masked guns than come com¬ 
pany front with those big black eyes. 
There’s the danger for you, and I’ve 
known it all along.” 

“ Don’t talk like an idiot! ” growled 
Bremerton impatiently. “ This is a. 
lure, just as the note to Lacey was a 
lure. Can’t you see it ? ” 

“ He says that,” murmured O’Hara, 
“ and calls me an idiot! My poor man,” 
he added, “ you are not yourself. That’s 
one thing I can see.” 

“ Of course I’m going—” 

“ Of course you are! ” 

“ If for nothing more than to con¬ 
vince you that you’re wasting a lot of 
sentiment on a scheming, treacherous 
woman! ” continued Bremerton hotly. 

“ You can’t take that back,” said 
O'Hara dryly; “but I’d not say it 
again. With me it will go no further.” 

“ We’ll put the girl to the test.” 

“ It’s you that will be put to the test, 
not Mariquita Mallory.” 

“ If an attack is made on me while 
I’m riding to Oak Flat, you’ll be con¬ 
vinced that the girl is not what she 
would have you think.” 

“ Nothing of the kind. I’ll be con¬ 
vinced that Deane’s enemies have 
watched their chance to catch you away 
from home. Even two coincidences 
wouldn’t spell the truth.” 

“ Be reasonable,” implored Bremer¬ 
ton. “ Don’t let your heart run away 
with your head.” 

“ And don’t you, Lee Bremerton, let 
the cursed plots of Deane run away 
with your sense of right and justice. 
Make your call. If you’re shot out of 
your saddle and brought back here with 
the breath gone out of your body, it 
will not be the girl I’d go hunting. 
Mark that! ” 

“ Whom would you hunt? ” queried 
the superintendent curiously. 

“ Why, the fiends who would cause 
that girl to bear the brunt of their own 
black deeds! Lee, you began your work 


here with a mistaken idea. You can 
make mistakes—I have seen you do it 
before. 

“ You went out of your way to think 
wrong of a woman. It comes hard for 
you to think it, and deep down in your 
heart you are not convinced; but 
Deane’s money has worked its spell, and 
you’ve got to do something to earn it. 

“ Deane! Deane! He’s the man 
who has built himself up by knifing his 
friends! He has piled high his dollars 
by blasting the hopes of others, by 
back-stabbing, by schemes that won’t 
bear the light, by—” 

“ No more of that, Mike! ” 

“—by talking fair to your face and 
hitting you with a club from behind! 
A robber so black that Big Steve and 
Chombo are white as the saints by com¬ 
parison! And he has hooked you— 
because I was slow in getting around 
with that'thousand! Can I ever for¬ 
give myself for that? ” 

The washed-out blue eyes snapped, 
the red hair seemed to stand on 
O’Hara’s head, and the blood rushed 
into the thin cheeks. The Irishman 
half rose and shook a clenched fist at 
the ceiling. 

“ He saved my life once,” said Brem¬ 
erton, his bronzed face almost white; 
“ and he wouldn’t play anything but 
square with me.” 

“ Square! ” sneered O’Hara. “ He 
has forgot how to be square! When 
he took the wrong turn of the trail he 
went money-mad. Play square with 
you! Lee, you’re a tool. On6 of these 
days you will find it out, and then, 
"blackguard that he is, I tremble for 
Silas Deane.” 

Without speaking a word, Bremer¬ 
ton turned on his heel and strode from 
the office. The notes of the flute fol¬ 
lowed Him through the door. 

CHAPTER XVI. 

THE CUL-DE-SAC. 

O’Hara was right. Bremerton’s 
attitude toward Mariquita Mallory 


was one of distrust, not of absolute 
conviction. At the first he was sure 
that the note to Lacey was a part of 
the tragic plot against him. 

Now he was uncertain. This sec¬ 
ond note revived his suspicions of the 
girl’s motives. It offered a chance to 
test her character, and as such he wel¬ 
comed it. 

If he were set upon while proceed¬ 
ing to the Mallorys’, then he would 
know the girl for what she was. In 
his own mind there would be no “ co¬ 
incidence ” about it. 

For him, perhaps, there was grave 
risk in the undertaking. He thought 
little of that. On an open trail in 
broad day he could use his eyes and 
his wits, and lurking foes would not 
easily get the better of him. 

The mill was sounding the six- 
o’clock whistle as he rode out of camp. 
The stamps clattered to a standstill, 
and from rising ground Bremerton 
looked back and saw the night shifts 
emerging from mine and mill and the 
day shifts straggling from bunk-house 
and Mexican quarter. 

Boom! Boom! came muffled explo¬ 
sions out of the distance. They were 
the blasts fired by the miners so that 
levels and shafts might be clear of 
fumes before the other gang went un¬ 
derground. 

From six to seven, at the beginning 
and the end of each day, the work 
closed down for breakfast and supper 
and the changing of shifts. 

Bremerton spurred over the top of 
the trail. For a quarter of a mile he 
would follow the main road to town' 
then turn into a branch that led to the 
canon and Oak Flat. 

The rough country contiguous to 
the valley had been piled with monu¬ 
ments, filed on, and now belonging to 
Deane as part of the Mariquita prop¬ 
erty. 

Bremerton had combed those adja¬ 
cent uplands in his search for the lost 
vein, and had found no “ blowouts ” 
or other promising indications. 

He believed the outlying claims com¬ 


prised merely a barrier against those 
who would poach on the Mariquita 
preserves. 

He was thinking less of that morn¬ 
ing errand than of the mysterious 
bonanza ledge when he reached the 
point where he was to leave the main 
trail. An east-and-west swale crossed 
the road, and his course lay through 
,the swale and toward the west. 

A road - runner darted out of the 
bushes on the right. The horse gave 
a startled snort and reared backward. 
At the same moment a sharp report 
rang out on the left, and Bremerton 
felt the wind of a bullet against his 
face. 

On so small a thing may a man’s 
life hang! The road-runner had 
startled the horse, and the horse had 
reared; and, at just that moment, the 
shot had been launched from the 
brush! 

Had Bremerton’s head been inclined 
a foot forward, Deane would have 
been looking for another superintend¬ 
ent. 

This flashed through Bremerton’s 
brain. But he had not much time for 
thought. The lurch of his mount had 
loosened the cinches, and the saddle 
turned. 

He made a wild effort to keep on 
the horse’s back. Finding this to he 
impossible, as the shot had still further 
alarmed tfie horse and set it to plung¬ 
ing, he tried to kick free of the stir¬ 
rups and strike the ground on his feet. 

One foot was freed, but the other 
became entangled. He fell heavily in 
the trail on his shoulders, kicking des¬ 
perately to get clear of the clinging 
stirrup. 

The horse, frenzied by the unusual 
turn of events, continued to rear and 
fling its heels. The outlook was dark 
indeed for Bremerton then, for he was 
in imminent danger of’ being trampled 
to death. 

A hoarse shout came from the chap¬ arral. A crushing of brush was heard at hajf a dozen widely
separated points. This, of course, was all lost  upon Bremerton, for the more immi¬ nent danger
claimed his attention. 

Suddenly the horse whirled to the 
right and ran into the swale, dragging 
its rider over the rough ground and 
through the greasewood. Bremerton 
was bumped against stones, lashed 
with brush-branches, and threatened at 
every leap with the pounding, iron- 
shod heels. 

He felt his senses going, and sur¬ 
rounding objects slid past him in a 
confused blur. Dimly he was aware 
of beating hoofs close at hand—not 
those of his own runaway horse, but 
others. 

One thought rose paramount in his 
befogged mind. They had him! At 
last those mysterious forces he had de¬ 
fied were closing in on their'quarry 1 

The horse stopped. Some one dis¬ 
mounted. The next moment his re¬ 
leased foot fell and his body lay prone 
upon the ground. There f.ollowed a 
preliminary trampling of the earth, 
ending in a tattoo of hoofs that faded 
into silence along the swale. 

“ Mr. Bremerton! ” 

He realized that his horse was gope; 
that another horse stood quietly a few 
yards from where he lay, and that on 
her knees beside him was Mariquita 
Mallory. He sat up, bewildered. 

“Bring on the rest of the gang!” 
he said presently. 

He felt for his automatic revolver, 
but it had been lost out of his pocket. 
There was nothing left with which to 
defend himself, and he must take 
whatever was to come. 

“ Can you get up? ” 

The girl put out her hand. With 
her assistance he gained his feet. 

“ Where are the rest of them? ” he 
demanded, glaring in the direction of 
the trail. 

“ They are behind,” she answered, 
“and crowding us close. Come, We 
must hurry.” 

“ Crowding ns close ? ” he returned. 

“ You may not believe it,” she said, 
with a trace of bitterness, “but they 
would not spare me any more than. 


they would you. You’ll have to trust 
me now, Mr. Bremerton, and you 
must pull yourself together and do 
your best.” 

She straightened and peered anx¬ 
iously up and down the swale; then 
she bent her head to listen. What she 
saw or heard was beyond Bremerton, 
but a look of wild alarm crossed her 
pallid face. 

“ Quick! ” she whispered, and seized 
his arm convulsively. 

He yielded himself passively into 
her hands. Whether she was a friend 
or foe made little difference just then. 
He knew his danger could not be more 
acute either way. 

Leaving her horse, Mariquita pulled 
him toward the bank of the swale. 
There she dropped to her knees and 
began climbing through the thick 
brush. The quirt, trailing from her 
wrist by a leather loop, got in her way. 
She jerked it from her arm and flung 
it aside. 

He followed her on all fours up 
and up through the mask of the chap¬ 
arral. His brain was clearing and'he 
wondered why she had abandoned her 
horse—why they had not both mount¬ 
ed the animal and galloped away. If 
she was really trying to befriend him 
that would have seemed like the safest 
course. 

He could not hear a sound in the 
depths of the scrub behind them. 
What had become of the man who 
had fired at him at the fork of the 
trail ? 

Perhaps the murderous scoundrel 
had been frightened away by the fail¬ 
ure of his plans; perhaps the girl was 
being carried away by her fears—she 
was a woman, and he had not much 
faith in a woman’s resourcefulness at 
such a time. 

In spite of his doubts, however, he 
made no protest. On hands and knees 
he crawled after the girl to the top of 
the bank. He would have spoken then, 
but she looked at him wildly and placed 
a finger on her lips. He started to 
rise, but she pulled him down. 



THE ARGOSY. 


Crack! 

From somewhere in the swale came 
the bark of a firearm. A bullet 
snapped through the bushes. The 
golden echoes had hardly died into 
silence before they were taken up by 
another report. 

This came from farther up the 
swale, but the snarling lead struck at 
the same point that had drawn the 
first shot. 

Then again and again, from widely 
varying locations below, bullets were 
hurled at that one spot on the top of 
the bank. The girl’s face was white, 
and yet she seemed to have herself 
well in hand. 

“ There’s nothing else for it! ” she 
whispered through tense lips, more to 
herself than to Bremerton; “we must 
take to the blind gully—it’s our only 
chance.” 

She turned and once more began 
worming her way onward. At a dis¬ 
tance of fifty feet the ground broke 
abruptly into a sheer descent ahead of 
them. They looked into a narrow, 
steep-walled gully. 

Bremerton had seen that gully be¬ 
fore. On the opposite side Deane’s 
outlying holdings embraced the up- 
and-down wall, and the last monument 
of the Mariquita property was heaped 
at the wall’s base. 

“ We’ve got to get down there, Mr. 
Bremerton! ” declared the girl. 

“ I can do it,” he answered; “ but 
you—” 

“ I can go wherever you can. Don’t 
let that worry you.” 

“ They’ll have us bottled up once 
we’re in the gully. I know the place, 
and it’s a veritable cul - de - sac. We 
can get into it here, but we can’t get 
out. .Once we’re down there they can 
take their time picking us off.” 

“ No,” and she spoke with an ef¬ 
fort, “ I know something about this 
cul-de-sac that you don’t.” 

She began letting herself over the 
rim. 

“ Wait,” he interposed. “ I’ll go 
first and help you.” 


“After being dragged by your 
horse as you were you may have all 
you can do to help yourself.” 

“ I’m all over that,” he answered, 
and lowered himself to a protruding 
stone in the cliff’s face. “ Come after 
me closely,” he added. “ I’m used to 
this rock-climbing.” 

Foot by foot they descended, a pro¬ 
jecting rock here, or a weather-worn 
seam in the wall there, affording 
them treacherous rounds in the cliff 
ladder. 

The girl was clear-headed and 
steady, and at this Bremerton mar¬ 
veled. Surely he had known very 
little about her up to that moment. 

Time after time he reached upward 
to place the small foot in a place of 
comparative safety, and occasionally 
he lifted his voice in warning where 
the hand-holds were weak or the foot¬ 
holds crumbling. 

When they neared the foot of the 
wall lead once more began to fly. The 
marksmen kept themselves in hiding, 
drop-shooting from an angle that 
made their work more unnerving than 
dangerous. 

Bullets struck against granite and 
glanced, singing, into space. A few 
ranged upward and inward and one 
spent ball passed through Bremerton’s 
sleeve. 

“ Now where ? ” asked Bremerton, 
as he and the girl stood side by side 
at the foot of the wall. 

His voice was even, almost colorless. 
Mariquita’s strained glance rested on 
his face curiously. 

“ You are a good deal of a man, Mr. 
Bremerton—in some things,” said she. 

“ This is no time for foolish talk,” 
he answered sharply. 

“ Nor for foolish actions, perhaps, 
such as the one I am about to do. This 
way, and be quick.” 

She ran across the boulder-strewn 
bed of the gully and gained a screen 
of chaparral on the other side. He 
followed. The firing, strangely enough, 
had- slackened and the dash was entire¬ 
ly successful. 

“ Come in here.” called the girl 
from a granite overhang. 

He stepped under the rock. In the 
half gloom a hand reached his and led 
him on and on into blank darkness. 

As he stumbled forward he reached 
out with his free hand and ran it 
gropingly over a ragged wall. Won¬ 
der gripped him. They were in a 
tunnel. Hard on the heels of wonder 
came a flash of hope and exultation. 


CHAPTER XVII. 

A woman’s sacrifice. 

"Who ran this tunnel into the 
gully wall, Miss Mallory?” 

Bremerton, in his excitement over 
this new discovery, forgot the dangers 
that had driven them into that sub¬ 
terranean refuge. His voice rang 
joyfully between the narrow walls, and 
the girl must have realized the trend of 
his thoughts. 

“ My father and I,” she answered 
quietly, “ dug and blasted our way 
into the heart of the hill.” 

“ It’s Deane’s ground! This is the 
lost vein, the bonanza ledge, I’ve 
been hunting for! I had an idea all 
the time that you and your father knew 
where it was—that you must know 
where it was. 

“ What did you do with the waste 
you took out of the bore? No one 
could look into the gully and even 
suspect that mining operations had 
been going on. Why did you mask 
the work? Why have you made a 
secret of it?” 

She had dropped his hand. Almost 
fiercely her voice leaped at him— 

“ I had to bring you here in order 
to save your life. Are you going to 
take advantage of the sacrifice and 
wreck the Mallorys completely ? Car- 
ruthers knew nothing about this vein. 
I found it. Our only weapon against 
Deane, all we could use in defending 
our rights, has been this secret of the 
hills. Are you going to turn that 
weapon against ns? ” 


Under the torrent of those hot 
words something like shame rose in 
his breast. She had saved his life at 
the expense of a golden secret, care¬ 
fully guarded. Was he more indebted 
to her, who had rescued him, than to 
Deane, his employer? 

Mariquita interpreted his silence as 
favoring her interests and her father’s. 
Her voice lost some of its sharpness as 
she went on. 

“ We are safe here. The wretches 
in the gully will not show themselves— 
they never do. They plot and kill 
from cover. Once seen they could be 
run to earth, identified, and made to 
suffer from what they have done and 
are doing. 

“ Eager as they are to destroy you, 
Mr. Bremerton, they are more eager 
to keep themselves out of any entan¬ 
glement with the law. They know how 
hard the law would deal with them—> 
on Griggsby’s account. Just a moment! 
There are candles and matches here, 
and I want you to see everything and 
to know everything. I think you will 
listen to me now.” 

He could hear her moving around 
near the opposite wall. Presently she 
came back to him. 

“ A light might be seen from the 
overhang,” said she, “ so we will not 
make one until we round the angle of 
the wall, a little way ahead. Come! ” 

She took his hand as before and 
led him forward and around a sharp 
turn. Half a dozen steps farther, and 
they halted again. 

“ First,” Mariquita observed, “ let 
me tell you how I happened to be in 
the swale. I don’t have to tell you 
what happened to Latey in answering 
a similar note of mine. You thought 
evil of me in that matter. It was in 
my mind this morning. 

“I knew you were threatened, and 
that a blow might fall while you were 
on the way to the canon. But I had 
to ask you to come to me, for you 
had made it impossible for me to come 
to the mine. I was anxious to learn 
whether you had faith enough in me—* 


whether your friend could persuade 
you—to answer that note in person.” 

“ I didn't need O’Hara’s persua¬ 
sions,” he broke in grimly, “ for I 
should have come, anyway. I wanted 
to test you—to find out whether a 
move would be made against me, as 
it had been made against Lacey in the 
same situation.” 

“ So ”—bitterly —“ when that shot 
was fired at the fork in the trail 
you considered the case against me 
proven! ” 

“ I had no time to consider any¬ 
thing. The saddle turned and I 
dropped in the road. But never mind 
that, Miss Mallory. Go on.” 

“ I had been watching the gang as 
well as I could, and I knew they were 
watching you, and only waiting for 
a chance to catch you off your guard. 
Since you sent Big Steve and Chombo, 
to prison your skulking foes have been 
hot for reprisal. 

“ They realized that I was trying to 
help you, and they would have black¬ 
ened my motives in your eyes if they 
could. Chombo tried it that night you 
found the amalgam. The stuff was 
hidden in that place so that, if dis¬ 
covered, you could not but think ill of 
the Mallorys.” 

Her voice caught in her throat, and 
her quick breathing there in the under¬ 
ground quiet smote on his ears. 

“ I was anxious about you, Mr. 
Bremerton,” she resumed, steadying 
herself, “ for I realized only too well 
what you would think if anything went 
wrong on your way to the canon. I 
rode to the swale by a roundabout 
bourse and was waiting for you to 
borne. I saw what happened. 

“As your horse charged past me, 
dragging you by a stirrup, I turned 
my own horse and followed. The 
thing I did not expect, but feared in 
my heart, had come to pass. If you 
had been killed, your friend O’Hara 
would have blamed me; but if I could 
do something to save you, then you 
and O’Hara would be compelled to be¬ 
lieve in me. That is why I stopped 


your horse, and that is why I made 
the sacrifice in bringing you here.” 

“ You wrong O'Hara. Nothing 
could make him suspect you of treach¬ 
ery. He hasn’t the same responsibility 
at the mine that I have,” Bremerton 
added dryly. “ It wasn’t my life par¬ 
ticularly but your own good name that 
concerned you.” 

“ Don’t think that! Deane has 
robbed us, and all we hoped was to 
effect some settlement with*him on the 
score of his lost vein. But he has no 
heart, no conscience. The more he 
was harrassed, and the harder the work 
at the mine was made for him, the 
nearer he might be forced to a com¬ 
promise with us. But the slaying, the 
shooting, the robbing—oh, in the name 
of justice, do not connect my father 
and me with that! ” 

“ Who has done it all ? ” 

“ Others. I don’t know who they 
are, and I don’t know the motives back 
of it, for they work in the dark. If 
you could discover who is paying the 
relatives of Big Steve and Chombo a 
pension, you would get a clue that 
might help unravel the mystery. We’ll 
not go into that now. My father and 
I are not to be identified with those 
wretches. You are to make sure of 
that, once and for all. 

“ My father knew you were com¬ 
ing to Phoenix. We went to town as 
soon as we heard, and he followed you 
about and took the first opportunity to 
warn you. No work was going on at 
the Mariquita Mine; and I think — I 
cannot be, positive—that there were 
some from there concerned in that 
attack on you by the town canal.” 

Remembering the ball of amalgam, 
and how it had ultimately led to the 
unmasking of Big Steve, Bremerton 
made no doubt that the girl was right. 
The conclusion was interesting, but led 
to no substantial results. 

“ My father, after he left you that 
night in Phoenix,” the girl pursued, 
“ heard the rush of men among the 
cottonwoods. Oh, the God’s pity that 
the attack should have happened then, 

of all times, so that blame could be 
laid at my father’s door! He came at 
once and told me, and I rode to the 
canal to see how matters had fared 
with you. For my trouble I had only 
hard words and cruel suspicion. That 
is what hurts a woman—some women. 
It—it hurt me. I wanted you to un¬ 
derstand the situation, Mr. Bremerton, 
and I smothered my pride and rode 
to the mine for a talk with you. It 
would have been better if I had stayed 
away. 

“ Under the strain of all this wrong 
and injustice my father’s health is 
breaking. He has fought for years 
with misfortune, and just at the mo¬ 
ment when success was, within his 
grasp it was snatched away by Deane, 
treacherously, deliberately, cruelly. If 
he had done what he should that night 
in Phoenix, father would have sent the 
police to the town canal. But he was 
not himself; and when he had brought 
word to me it was too late. 

"■As soon as we came back home 
from town, I began trying to learn 
something about these others who are 
fighting Deane. Night after night I 
have hovered about the mine. I saw 
Big Steve go to thtf arroyo and meet 
Chombo, but I could not follow Chom- 
bo and find what he did with the 
amalgam. 

“The night of the capture I was close 
to Chombo when the shot was fired at 
you. I could not see the man who fired, 
but I heard him scrambling away. I 
took after him, but he evaded me in the 
pitchy darkness of the arroyo. 

“ When I got back to Oak Flat I 
found you there, and O’Hara and the 
sheriff. Can you put yourself in my 
place and realize how I felt to hear 
from the sheriff that Chombo accused 
me of shooting at you? I had just 
worn myself out trying to run down 
that skulking, cowardly scoundrel.” 

A feeling of sympathy for the girl 
had grown in Bremerton’s breast as she 
talked. He was glad of the dark and 
that he could not see her face. Had 
there been anything more to impress 


him in her favor, his sense of duty 
toward Deane would surely have suf¬ 
fered. 

“No doubt I have been mistaken,” 
said Bremerton slowly. “ After my 
interview with Lacey, though, the mis¬ 
take was natural. I am willing to set 
aside our past differences, Miss Mal¬ 
lory, and we can make common cause 
against these prowling devils who 
shoot from ambush, and rob and work 
under cover. Do you want it that 
way ? ” 

“ What will be the end. of our 
work ? ” she asked doubtfully. 

“ We will drive them out,” he an¬ 
swered resolutely, “ and bring to pun¬ 
ishment those who murdered Griggsby 
and sent Lacey to the hospital.” 

“ But apart from that ? ” she per¬ 
sisted. 

“ Why, with the bonanza vein to 
draw on for ore, I will equal the show¬ 
ing you and your father made at the 
Mariquita! Deane _ will unload the 
property for half a million, and—” 

“ And,” she cut in icily, “ you will 
receive five hundred dollars a month 
for your work and a bonus of ten 
thousand dollars! The half million be¬ 
longs by right to my father and me. 
It goes to Deane; and we get—what ? ” 

Bremerton had no answer for that. 
His knowledge stopped short of the 
Mallorys and their so-called “ rights.” 
Deane was his friend, his employer. 
When Bremerton gave his word about 
anything, it v 7 as as good as his bond. 

“ You have nothing to say,” mur¬ 
mured Mariquita. “ Now that you 
have listened so far, Mr. Bremerton, 
you must hear the rest of it. First, 
though, it will be well to go to the 
overhang and reconnoiter. I do not 
imagine that the men in the gully have 
the slightest idea what has become of 
us, but it is just as well to be on the 
safe side. If you will wait here for a 
few minutes—” 

“ I’ll do the reconnoitering,” he cut 
in, and groped his way back around 
the turn and to the mouth of the 
tunnel. 

At the lip of the overhang he could 
hear the distant growling of the stamp- 
mill. It was faint, however, and if 
there had been any stirring about in 
the gully he would have been aware 
of it. 

It was impossible for him either to 
see or to hear anything of his mys¬ 
terious enemies. 

When he returned he found that the 
girl had lighted a candle. The light 
fell over her face, bringing out and 
accentuating each softly molded line. 
Her large eyes met his wistfully, ap¬ 
pealingly, as she put the candle in his 
hand and pointed to the breast of the 
level. 

“ There! ” she whispered. “ Look 
at the vein—the one I found—the one 
my father and I developed—the ledge 
that makes the Mariquita Mine worth 
half a million! Examine it, Mr. 
Bremerton.” 

He walked to the breast, brushed 
his hand over the surface of the 
rocks, held the candle close, and bent 
forward. Another moment and he 
staggered back astounded, scarcely 
breathing. 

He knew—none better—the full 
worth of what he saw. Prospecting 
was his trade, and often he had horn- 
spooned samples of crushed ore and 
found values that would have turned 
many a man’s head. But never had he 
seen anything to compare with the in¬ 
dications of that bonanza lead! 


CHAPTER XVIII. 

THE WILES OF A TRICKSTER. 

“ Rich ? ” said Mariquita passively. 

“ Rich! ” he gasped. “ Well, it’s the 
richest thing this side of the Comstock 
lode! And the vein’s a foot wide and 
a true fissure. Such veins increase in 
values as you go down on them. What 
will the assays be a hundred feet, or 
a thousand feet, below? It’s a—a—” 

Words failed him. His voice trailed 
off into wondering silence. 

“ There’s not much outcropping on 


top of the hill,” she said, her even 
tones contrasting queerly with his 
hoarse, vehement words. “ I picked 
up just one insignificant piece of 
‘ float ’ and trailed the clue until I had 
uncovered a mere ‘ stringer.’ 

“ But that stringer was so rich that 
father and I covered up the opening 
and obliterated every sign of mineral. 
Every man at the mine was discharged 
and not one suspected a ‘ strike.’ 

“ I guess we were wrong in doing 
that. The theory was correct, but it 
did not work out well. I worked side 
by side with father, digging that tun¬ 
nel. We were months at it, and we 
guarded every move we made. The 
waste from the tunnel we pitched into 
a hole beside the overhang and covered 
it with brush. 

“ When we began to take out ore 
we hauled it in sacks up the side of 
the gully. Father fired and ran the 
engine at the mill, and I stood over the 
plates, dosing them with * quick.’ 

“ We’d run a day, then have a clean¬ 
up, and spend a week getting out more 
ore. jYou’d hardly believe, Mr. Brem¬ 
erton, the way the amalgam ridged it¬ 
self up on those plates! The gold 
tumbled out of the sieves and banked 
up so high in front of the battery- 
boxes that we-had to scrape it away 
every half-hour. 

“ Father was like a boy. Twenty 
years dropped from his shoulders. He 
skipped back and forth between the en¬ 
gine-room and the batteries, and every 
once in a while he would stop to pat 
me on the shoulder and laugh, ‘ Girl, 
we’re made! A palace and all the big 
things in life for you, ’way out there 
in the East! At last, so help me, the. 
Mallorys are coming into their own.’ 

“ But he was too quick with his hur¬ 
rahs. We had spent so much time 
ion the tunnel that we couldn’t mine 
and mill enough ore to pay for the 
property.” 

Into the mild depths of her eyes 
came a swift change. She clutched 
her hands and wrung them convul¬ 
sively. 

“ Ah, the sorry way luck turned for 
us! ” . she whispered. “ With more 
than enough gold in sight to pay Car¬ 
ruthers a thousand times over, we had 
to go to Deane for a paltry twenty 
thousand dollars. He put us off, 
played fast and loose with us, until 
finally he had the mine, and we were 
worse off than nothing.” 

Her eyes snapped fire, and her hands 
fell at her sides and clenched fiercely. 
“ A blacker-hearted scoundrel never 
lived than Silas Deane! ” 

Bremerton had been given time to 
calm himself. He studied the flame of 
the candle for a moment, then fixed 
the candle on a ledge in drippings of 
its own grease. 

“ You are to tell me all about that 
now,” said he. “ Why not sit down 
and be comfortable? ” 
i “ It’s not a comfortable subject— 
for me,” she answered, standing in 
front of him as he dropped on a boul¬ 
der by the hanging wall. “ I’m getting 
ahead of my 6tory, too, and starting at 
the middle, where I should have gone 
back to the beginning. 

“ It was not always the Mariquita 
Mine, Mr. Bremerton. When Carru- 
thers found it, and consolidated the 
several claims, it was known as the 
Apache. Carruthers built the mill and 
laid the pipe-line, and opened up the 
vein you are now working on. You 
have already discovered that the vein 
is very ordinary, and leaves no more 
than a small margin of profit. It 
looked pretty good to father and me, 
though. 

“ An uncle in the East had died and 
left me two thousand dollars. One 
Christmas Day father took over the 
property at twenty-five thousand dol¬ 
lars. Carruthers .was to have my two 
thousand dollars down and three thou¬ 
sand dollars more the first year. Then, 
on the next Christmas Day—it was at 
noon the time expired—if the remain¬ 
ing twenty thousand dollars was not 
paid the mine was to revert at once to 
Carruthers. You’re - a mining man and 
you know how such deals go. 


“We paid expenses, and by careful 
planning got out of the old vein enough 
more to give Carruthers his five thou¬ 
sand and complete the first payment. 
Then, in midsummer, I discovered the 
new lead. 

“ I’ve told you about that. Father 
and I were afraid that Carruthers,/if 
he knew what we had found, would 
discover some way to void his contract. 
If we had been less suspicious, and had 
kept some of the men to help run in 
the tunnel, we could have taken out and 
milled ten times more than we needed 
to pay Carruthers. But we were afraid 
of him. For that reason we did the 
work ourselves and kept our golden 
secret locked up in our own hearts. 
Early December came and we had 
nothing for Carruthers. Then, in an 
unlucky moment, father thought of 
Deane.” 

Mariquita paused, - fought down her 
rising emotion, and presently con¬ 
tinued. 

“ Father had a passing acquaintance 
with this—this ‘ mining king,’ as they 
call him. He believed that we could 
go to Denver, show Deane our bullion 
certificates, and get from him as much 
money as we needed in exchange for 
a tenth interest in the property. So we 
went to Denver. 

“.Deane was more than friendly— 
that is always his way, I’m told, when 
he’s planning deviltry. He listened to 
father, took his bullion certificates, 
verified them in course of a week, and 
then asked how we could make such 
a good showing with a ten-stamp mill 
on ten-dollar rock. 

“ Father did not let him into our 
secret, but told him pointblank that 
after the Mallory’s got the claim hard 
and fast and he was in for a tenth in¬ 
terest he would be given further light. 
‘ I’ll take care of you, Mallory,’ said 
Deane. Those were his very words, 
Mr. Bremerton. ‘ I’ll take care of you, 
Mallory, and don’t you lose any sleep.’ 
Day after day he put us off, reassur¬ 
ing us, luring us on with false hopes, 
until the 25th of December came. 

“ Carruthers was in Denver at the 
time. We surprised him once with 
Deane on one of our many trips to 
Deane’s office. Oh, we were blind, 
blind, not to have suspected trickery! 
But father had faith in Deane up till 
ten o’clock that last day. It—it—” 
Jthe girl’s voice quivered in her throat 
<—“ it was then that Deane threw off 
his mask and curtly told father he had 
ho money for him, and that he would 
have to look elsewhere for it. 

“ Look elsewhere! Where could we 
look? We knew no one in Denver but 
Deane and Carruthers. I thought 
father would go crazy. He grabbed 
Deane by the throat, and I believe he 
would have killed him if I hadn’t in¬ 
terfered. Some clerks came and threw 
father out of that gilded den of crook¬ 
edness, and we spent hours trying to 
get the money for Carruthers. Mean¬ 
while—meanwhile—” 

The girl choked and walked up and 
down the level for a few moments to 
get control of herself. 

“ Meanwhile,” she finished, “ Car¬ 
ruthers had transferred the Mariquita 
Mine to Deane for fifty thousand dol¬ 
lars! Do you know what this friend 
of yours did?” 

Her eyes flamed, and she leaned to¬ 
ward Bremerton with her face set and 
strained and her breath coming in 
short, labored gasps. 

“ This friend of yours, this man 
who hired you to come down here and 
make a showing with the mine that 
would enable him to sell it for half a 
million, this mean, false-hearted scoun¬ 
drel had been browbeating Carruthers 
all the while he had been feeding my 
father with hopes and promises. 

“ He told Carruthers that the Mari¬ 
quita Mine was enormously rich, and 
he declared that if Carruthers would 
not give him an option on it for fifty 
thousand dollars he would give my 
father the money to get it for half 
that sum. Carruthers could take his 
choice. 

“ So far as Carruthers is concerned, 
I do not think he was much better than 


Deane. It was the case of two rogues' 
plucking an honest old man. Car¬ 
ruthers must have squirmed. For him 
it was either let the mine go to father 
or to Deane — a mine worth half a 
million, and for which the best he 
could get was a paltry fifty thousand. 

“ There were high words in that 
fine office, but Deane won—Carruthers 
had to give in. Father and I came 
back to Phoenix, and all we had in the 
world were a few tools, a few head 
of horses—and the secret of that rich! 
vein. 

“ So long as that new vein could 
not be discovered, the Mariquita Mine 
was worth little. Already our work 
in the gully had been well hidden, but 
we went by night and made the hiding 
more secure. 

“ Poor Griggsby hunted until he was 
worn out, and Lacey, too, searched 
high and low. But neither of them 
suspected the wall - of that cul-de-sac 
of containing mineral. 

“ And you had no better luck, Mr. 
Bremerton. There are absolutely no 
mineral indications in or around the 
gully. The original claim there was 
only an outpost for the Mariquita 
property, anyway.” 

Sadness, almost despair, crept into 
her voice as she proceeded: 

“ Father and I went back to our 
little ranch in the canon. We watched 
the developments over in the valley. 
We wanted the superintendents Deane 
sent out here to fail, and we lived in 
hopes that Deane would at last be 
forced to come to us and give us a 
half interest in the property for telling 
him what we knew. After a time we 
discovered that other and secret ene¬ 
mies were fighting Deane, hampering 
his operations in every conceivable 
way and seeking to drive him out of 
the district. 

“ Night after night, while Griggsby 
was here, the pipe-line was cut; thiev¬ 
ing must have been going on in the 
mill, too, for the bullion output was 
barely enough for expenses; the mill 
was set on fire and barely saved; there 

was discontent among the men; then, 
on top of all this, Griggsby worried 
about the lost vein and his inability 
to make good. Finally,” and the girl 
shivered, “ he paid the penalty for 
helping Deane. 

“ Lacey was sent down. He was 
energetic and able, and he ruled with 
an iron hand. But he was not success¬ 
ful. His best men left, for the Mari- 
quita Mine was getting an evil name 
on account of Griggsby. He had to 
hire the riffraff of the district in order 
to do any work at all, and that move 
brought its own troubles. 

“ Father and I, while all these other 
enemies of Deane’s were at work, 
watched and hoped. Would Deane 
give up?. Would he come to us? 

“ Father heard of a plot against 
Lacey. We were both sick of the 
shooting and the bloodshed, hard 
though our thoughts were toward that 
master schemer in Denver. I sent 
Lacey a note and asked him to come 
to our ranch and hear some important 
news. He had distrusted us all along. 
For all that, though, he started to 
come to us, and — and those others 
seized that as their chance to strike. 

“ Afterward you appeared. Some 
one in Denver — a man in Deane’s 
office—informed us about that. You 
know what we have done and tried to 
do since you reached the mine, Mr. 
Bremerton. This lost lead has been 
our only weapon in a hard, hopeless, 
one-sided fight against a powerful and 
influential man. Now ”—a sob rushed 
to Mariquita’s lips as she said it—“ you 
know our secret. Ought I to have let 
you die rather than bring you here? 
Are we—my father and I—entitled to 
any consideration at your hands? I 
have told you the truth. Are you for 
us or .against us? ” 

There, in the dimly lighted level, 
her face and manner grew all appeal¬ 
ing. With tears running down her 
cheeks she reached out her hands in 
mute supplication. 

Bremerton’s eyes wandered to the 
breast of the level, to that foot-wide 


streak of bonanza ore which the girl 
and her father, by the hardest kind of 
labor, had laid bare. The superintend¬ 
ent’s ga:ze returned to the slender, be¬ 
seeching form and tear-stained face in 
front of him. He got slowly to his 
feet. 

“ I shall prove what you say, Miss 
Mallory,” he answered then in a 
husky, unnatural voice, “ and if it is 
true, as God hears me, I will see that 
you get your rights! But you must 
wait—you must be patient—you must 
have confidence in me, and— No, no, 
not that! ” 

Before he could draw back she had 
flung herself on her knees at his feet, 
caught one of his hands, and pressed 
it to her lips. 

CHAPTER XIX. 
o’hara goes gunning., 

Bremerton had not been gone an 
hour from the mine when King, wild¬ 
ly excited, came running to O’Hara. 
The Irishman had just climbed to the 
ore platform on his way into the mill, 
and the sharp cries of King brought 
him to a quick aboutface. 

“What’s to pay?” demanded 
O’Hara, startled by the look and man¬ 
ner of the cyanid expert. 

“ Bremerton’s horse has come back, 
O’Hara, and with an empty saddle! ” 

“ When was this ? ” 

“Just now — just this minute! I 
ran from the corral to find you. 
They’ve got him, O’Hara! By George, 
they’ve got him! ” 

O’Hara took the pipe from his teeth 
and knocked out the ashes against the 
side of the mill. His thick eyebrows 
lowered over the crisscross eyes and 
his big, thin-lipped mouth twisted, but 
with no attempt at speech. 

With one hand he groped in his 
pocket for his tobacco-sack. With de¬ 
liberation he filled the bowl, put away 
the sack, and scratched a match. 

“ Do you hear ? ” piped King, fail¬ 
ing to understand why he had not 


created a sensation. “ Bremerton’s 
horse has come back, and—” 

“ Never you mind,” cut in O’Hara 
in his softest tones; “ it’s my "business, 
and not yours, and I’ll be seeing to it. 
Go to the bunk-house and get Collins’s 
Winchester. Fetch it to the corral 
after makin’ sure there are loads in it.” 

“ Why—” 

“ Don’t shilly-shally. This is no 
time for whys. On the jump now.” 

O’Hara thrust his head through the 
opening that led to the ore-loft and 
shouted for Giles. The battery man 
came bounding up the steps. 

“ Giles, I’m called away,” said 
O’Hara, “ and until I come back you’ll 
be doin’ the amalgamating along with 
the rest of it.” 

“ Sure.” 

“ There’s a cracked shoe in No. i 
battery. Keep your eye on it.” 

“ I will.” 

O’Hara’s struck another match, 
trailed it over his pipe-bowl, and 
jumped from the ore platform. The 
pipe was going under forced draft as 
he hurried in the direction of the 
corral. 

Bremerton’s horse, still restive, 
stood with the looped reins thrown 
over a corral-post. The saddle swung 
underneath, the stirrups resting on the 
ground. 

“ Not so bad maybe,” muttered 
O’Hara. “The saddle turned with 
him, and it’s possible he’s had no more 
than a spill. Whoa, Basham!” he 
added, stepping to the horse and be¬ 
ginning to readjust the riding-gear. 

By the time King reached the corral 
O’Hara had the reins off the post and 
was mounted and waiting."* 

“ It’s loaded,” the little expert flut¬ 
tered, handing the gun to O’Hara. 

“Good enough! ” 

“ You’re—you’re not going alone to 
look for Bremerton?” 

“Not? Watch me! Keep a still 
tongue between your teeth, King, and 
look after the work. I’ll be back when 
I get here.” 

He dug in with his heels. The ex¬ 


cited horse snorted and reared, and 
then was off like an arrow along the 
trail. King watched the long body 
humped over the saddle - horn until 
horse and rider had vanished over the 
“ rise.” 

The mill began to pound, and the 
pounding gradually merged into a 
long, continuous roar. The expert 
tossed his hands helplessly and appre¬ 
hensively, and turned back toward the 
office. 

“ It’s the beginning of the end,” he 
muttered, “ but hanged if I stay here 
while some one else comes to take 
Bremerton’s place! I’ve had enough 
of this, goodness knows! ” 

O’Hara’s thoughts were busy. It 
was clear Bremerton had not gone far 
before the saddle turned with him— 
the riderless horse had been too quick 
in getting back to the mine. No doubt 
it was this side of the canon that 
Bremerton had taken his fall. 

As soon as he was over the side of 
the hill O’Hara pulled the horse down 
to a slower pace. His eyes focused on 
the trail and keenly watched it as he 
proceeded. The dust was fetlock deep 
and he knew it would show signs. 

He found what he was looking for 
near the place where the trail forked. 
The marks were as clear as words in 
an open book. 

First, there was a clutter of hoof- 
prints. Running through them was a 
broad streak as though a heavy bag 
had been dragged at the end of a rope. 
Then, too, the horse pricked up its 
ears and seemed to have fears in that 
particular place. O’Hara’s face hard¬ 
ened. 

“ Begorrv,” he murmured, “ it’s 
worse than I thought. Lee was 
thrown and dragged straight into the 
swale if the marks don’t lie, ajid this 
mount I’m on is the one that snaked 
him along. How did he get loose? 
And if he got loose and is all right, 
why don’t I meet him? I wonder if 
I’m going to see something in that 
swale that I don’t want to see?” 

The horse trembled and did not 
want to go into the swale. O’Hara 
forced the animal, and as they moved 
along the bushes gave mute evidence 
of Bremerton’s progress through them. 

Near the spot where the torn and 
disordered chaparral ceased to show 
further signs O’Hara found a horse, 
patiently standing with the reins 
drooping from the bit-rings. 

Unless the Irishman was greatly 
mistaken that waiting horse belonged 
to Mariquita Mallory. At once his 
mind was flooded with puzzling ques¬ 
tions. Guess as hard as he would, 
however, he could make nothing of 
that odd situation there in the swale. 

Dropping the reins of his own 
mount, he slid to the ground and be¬ 
gan beating up the brush. He found 
nothing at all, and this was a sort of 
negative satisfaction. 

Just as he had about finished his 
searching a dull report clashed on his 
ears, a bit of lead whispered, and the 
brim of his hat twitched. 

“So that’s the way of it!” he ex¬ 
claimed, and let go with the Winches¬ 
ter from the hip. 

His ears were keen even if his eye¬ 
sight could not serve, and a heavy slug 
whistled toward the point from which 
the shot had been fired at him. A cry 
broke from the depths of the brush. 

O’Hara located the point on the 
swale - bank and hastened toward it. 
When, as near as he could judge, he 
came to the spot he saw no one. Save 
for the murmuring of the stamp-mill 
the swale was steeped in deathly si¬ 
lence. 

“ Faith, this is a brain - twister! ” 
muttered O’Hara, rearing head and 
shoulders above the bushes and peer¬ 
ing about him. “ Show yourselves, 
you imps of the Old Nick! ” he cried. 
“ Or come again with a shot so I may 
be after locatin’ you! ” 

His invitation was not accepted. 
No form materialized out of the 
depths of the chaparral, and there was 
no more firing. 

“ Now, what would you think of 
that?” soliloquized the Irishman, re¬ 


moving his hat and surveying the 
hole through the brim. “ Sure I 
touched up the omadhoun that gave 
me the souvenir, but where in the 
name of the saints is he ? Whisht! ” 
he added abruptly, listening. 

He heard something. Whatever it 
was it was feeble, and the faint mur¬ 
muring of the mill almost drowned it. 
Clapping the hat on his head, he pro¬ 
ceeded on over the swale-bank, paus¬ 
ing and straining his ears at every 
other step. 

His course brought him to the brink 
of the gully. His gaze, running along 
the abrupt break in the earth, rested 
wonderingly on the end of a rope. 

The rope was tied to a scraggy iron- 
wood growing near the brink, and was 
hanging over the cliff’s face. 

O’Hara laid aside the gun, dropped 
to his knees, and looked downward. 
Then he gave an exclamation. Near, 
the bottom of the swinging rope, a 
yard from the base of the wall, lay the 
motionless form of a man. But it was 
not Bremerton; no, not Bremerton! 
O’Hara breathed again. 

“ Is it the blackguard who shot at 
me?” thought the Irishman. “Did 
my bullet drop him over the edge, or 
was he going down the rope and did 
he fall?” 

It was a matter for immediate in¬ 
vestigation. O’Hara went to the iron- 
wood, sat down with his heels over 
space, twisted his long legs in the 
rope, took the Winchester under his 
arm, and began to slide. Hampered 
with the gun, he made awkward work 
of it, but reached the foot of the wall 
safely. 

The prostrate form, lying limply 
and with arms thrown wide from the 
shoulders, proved to be a man whom 
O’Hara had never seen before. His 
hat lay at a little distance, and his hair 
was dark and streaked with gray. 

A stubble of beard covered his 
cheeks and chin. His eyes were closed. 
He was plainly unconscious, although 
a groan was now and then wrenched 
from his tense lips. 

“ No shot of mine touched him,” 
muttered O’Hara after an examina¬ 
tion. “ He fell from the wall, and 
that’s the whole of it. Was he or was 
he not the fellow who cut loose at me 
with that bullet? And how, in the 
fiend’s name, is he mixed up with 
Bremerton and Mariquita Mallory? 
Sure, I’m staggered with what I know 
and don’t know.” 

The clothing of the injured man was 
rather better than that usually worn 
by miners. A Mexican carved-leather 
band was around his hat, and at his 
waist was a belt with a holster and a 
heavy navy revolver. His hands, al¬ 
though browned from exposure, gave 
no evidence of hard labor. 

Here was a mystery, and O’Hara 
hated mysteries. Yet he was com¬ 
pelled to grapple with this one, for it 
seemed to bear directly upon what had 
happened to Bremerton. 

He tried to arouse the stranger, for 
a few words from him would go far 
toward clearing up the situation. His 
efforts failed and he rose to his feet 
in perplexity. 

While he stood there, cudgeling his 
brain, he was electrified by a shout 
from across the gully. Whirling on 
the instant, he was amazed and over¬ 
joyed to see Bremerton coming to¬ 
ward him. And behind Bremerton 
was Miss Mallory. He advanced to 
meet them. 

Bremerton’s hat was gone and his 
clothes were dusty and tom and in 
much disorder. All the indications 
pointed to a desperate experience of 
some sort on his part. 

“ The sight o’ you does my eyes 
good, Bremerton! ” cried O’Hara. “ I 
was not expecting to find you with 
your feet under you, but down and out 
somewhere in the scrub. Your horse 
came back to the mine without you, 
and the saddle in such shape that I 
knew you had had a spill. Troth, 
man, but I’m glad things are no worse. 
Miss Mallory,” and he smiled and 
doffed his hat, “ seeing you is a sur¬ 
prise and a pleasure. I found your 


horse in the swale, though, so I ought 
not to be surprised.” 

“ Miss Mallory saved my life,” be¬ 
gan Bremerton, “ and—” 

“ Och, the luck you have!” smiled 
the Irishman; “not that your life is 
saved, do you mind, but that Miss 
Mallory saved it for you. But if 
there’s saving to do, she is the kind 
to be depended upon. Now, can you 
tell me who is the man at the foot of 
the wall ? ” 

O’Hara turned and pointed toward 
the crumpled heap of humanity. The 
girl stared, smothered an exclamation 
of horror, then ran forward. When 
Bremerton and O’Hara came to her 
side she turned a white face to them. 

“ Stranger to me,” commented 
Bremerton. “ Is he to you. Miss Mal¬ 
lory ? ” 

“ No,” she answered in a strained 
voice. “ I have seen the man several 
times, Mr. Bremerton.” 

Her eyes wandered to the rope, fol¬ 
lowed it down, and rested again on 
the sprawled-out form. “ He is Dave 
Carruthers,” she added. 

CHAPTER XX. 

A PLOTTER UNMASKED. 

Carruthers! 

To O’Hara that name meant little. 
To Bremerton and the girl, time and 
place considered, it was deeply signifi¬ 
cant. Bremerton’s glance sought Mari- 
quita’s face, and he read there a‘reflec¬ 
tion of his own thoughts. 

Here was Deane’s wily and im¬ 
placable foe. Here was the man who, 
bullied into selling the mine for a tithe 
of its value, had striven to regain by 
lawless methods what he had lost by 
legal sharp practise. 

He had fallen from the rope while 
lowering himself into the gully. There 
seemed no doubt of that. A hard fate 
had finally unmasked him. 

Bremerton knelt and made a hasty 
examination. He got up, shaking his 
head ominously. 

“If I am any judge, he is close to 
the end of his trail,” said he. “ Miss 
Mallory and I heard shooting, 
O’Hara,” he went on. “ Were you 
concerned in it ? ” 

O’Hara explained. 

“ He fell from the rope,” hazarded 
Bremerton, “ and those with him were 
frightened away. I think the way is 
clear for us now. We must get Car- 
ruthers to the mine. If possible, he 
must be revived so he can talk. Miss 
Mallory, you can climb out of here by 
means of the rope ? ” 

“ Yes,” she answered, and started 
toward the wall. 

“ Wait, please,” interposed Bremer¬ 
ton. “ O’Hara should go first with the 
rifle. That will guard against possible 
surprises. If the horses afe still there, 
O’Hara, when I am ready here, you can 
hitch the upper end of the rope to a 
saddle.” 

The Irishman nodded and climbed 
the rope readily enough. Bremerton 
tied the gun to the dangling end, and it 
was drawn rapidly upward. When the 
rope was thrown down again, Mari- 
quita made the ascent, watched anx¬ 
iously by Bremerton. 

There was no call for anxiety. With 
strength and skill the girl drew herself 
from crevice to projecting stone the 
full length of the wall, and was helped 
over the brink by O’Hara. 

Bremerton then dragged Carruthers 
closer to the wall, tied the rope snugly 
under his arms, and called to O’Hara 
to hoist away. The limp, twisting 
body rose gruesomely in the air, and 
Mariquita caught it at the top of the 
wall, and by main strength drew it over 
the ledge. 

Finally the rope was thrown back to 
Bremerton, and he won to the crest 
with little difficulty. Both horses were 
in the swale. 

“ Get into the saddle, Mike,” said 
Bremerton. “ I’ll lift Carruthers up to 
you, and you can support him in front 
of you for the little distance we have 
to go. I’ll walk.” He turned to the 
girl while O’Hara was mounting. 


“ Miss Mallory,” he went on, “ will 
you ride to Phoenix and send out a doc¬ 
tor and the sheriff? ” 

“ I want to do anything—everything 
—I can,” she answered. 

“ This is all we can do now. Re¬ 
member what I told you,” he finished 
earnestly; “ and, whatever happens, do 
not doubt me.” 

There was a pathetic curve to her 
lips as she looked at him trustingly and 
smiled. 

“ I could not leave the fortunes of 
the Mallory^ in better hands, Mr. 
Bremerton,” said she and hurried away 
to her horse. 

She was away at speed while Brem¬ 
erton and O’Hara were attending to 
Carruthers. It was a slow journey 
they had back to the mine, but they 
reached their destination and had the 
injured man in Bremerton’s bed long 
before the noon whistle sounded from 
the mill. 

Neither Bremerton nor O’Hara had 
done any talking on the return jour¬ 
ney. King, who hurried to the office, 
did enough talking for half a dozen. 

“ Carruthers! What in goodness’ 
name was the matter with him?” 
“ What had happened to Bremerton? ” 
“ Was he rescued by O’Hara? ” 

The superintendent wearily parried 
the expert’s questions. 

“ All in due time, King,” said he, 
“ you’ll know everything. We’ve sent 
for a doctor. Just now, though, you 
might help O’Hara try to bring Car¬ 
ruthers around. I’ve got to fix up a 
little.” 

Bremerton attended to his bruises 
and scratches, and went through with 
his fixing up. When he had finished, 
Carruthers was no nearer conscious¬ 
ness than he had been before. 

“ He’s obstinate about getting back 
to earth,” O’Hara reported. “Faith, 
it’s a doctor’s job, or the undertaker’s, 
and we’ll have to wait. Why did you 
send for the sheriff, Lee? ” 

“ It’s important for him to be here 
in case Carruthers revives and has 
anything to say.” • 

“ You’ve got me guessing. Why the 
importance? ” 

King had gone his wondering way. 
Bremerton and O’Hara sat by the bed, 
watching the injured man closely. It 
was high time O’Hara understood the 
drift of affairs, and Bremerton gave 
him his full confidence. 

The struggle Mariquita and her fa¬ 
ther had gone through with Deane, 
Deane’s treachery to them, and his cov¬ 
ert bullying of Carruthers were blunt¬ 
ly stated. An angry red rushed into the 
Irishman’s face and hi^eyes gleamed 
as he listened. 

“ You got all that from lips that 
couldn’t lie!” he exclaimed when his 
friend finished. “ What have you to 
say to it? ” 

“ Nothing—yet. I want more proof 
that Deane is the unscrupulous devil the 
girl has painted him.” 

“ Oh, but you can strain at a point! 
Where are you to get this proof ? ” 

Bremerton nodded toward Carru¬ 
thers. “ He’ll furnish it.” 

"If he’s ever able to talk, he may. 
There’s nothing certain.” 

“ Then I’ll get the proof from 
Deane.” 

“ How ? ” 

“ In my own way,” said Bremerton, 
gazing out of the window. 

O’Hara hoisted around in his chair 
and peered at his friend through nar¬ 
rowing eyes. 

“ And if you get this proof,” he 
queried, “ what will you do ? ” 

“ Throw a thousand dollars of 
Deane’s dirty money in his face,” 
snapped Bremerton. “ That much he 
has paid me, and you have made it pos¬ 
sible to give it back. Then I’ll go fur¬ 
ther, by Heaven! and see that the Mal- 
lorys get what they’re entitled to.” 

“ Fine! ” exclaimed O’Hara. “ Glory 
be, ’tis the finest thing in life to see a 
good man get right with himself. I 
knew it would come! You can throw 
the money in Deane’s face if you will, 
although I doubt the sense of that; but 
you’ll never get the Mallorys their 
rights. Deane has gone to school for 


his bunco games, and you don’t know 
your A B abs about the dirty work. 
Lock horns with him on that point, 
Bremerton, and both you and the Mal¬ 
lorys will get the worst of it.” 

The mill whistle blew. The clamor 
of the stamps died to silence and a gen¬ 
eral movement set in toward the chuck- 
shanty. Bremerton remained with 
Carruthers' while O’Hara went for his 
meal; then O’Hara relieved Bremerton. 

When the latter returned to the of¬ 
fice he was surprised to find the Irish¬ 
man with the contents of Carruthers’s 
pockets on a table in front of him. , 

“ When you’re looking for evi¬ 
dence,” explained O’Hara, “ personal 
belongings are common property. Now 
here’s this solid-framed forty-five- 
caliber Colt. Three empty shells in the 
cylinder. One load just missed you at 
the fork of the trail, thanks to the 
road-runner; another raked the bushes 
while you and Mariquita were getting 
out of the swale; the other, maybe, 
put that hole in my hat.” 

“ That’s guesswork, Mike,” re¬ 
turned Bremerton. 

“ Close to the mark, though. If you 
ask for a motive, isn’t there a good 
one to tack onto Carruthers? When 
rogues fall out the divil gets his dues. 
Here’s a watch with a nugget fob. The 
hands quit telling the time at seven 
twenty-five. That’s when he dropped. 
And here’s a note-book with interest¬ 
ing readin’, Lee.” 

O’Hara picked up a small memo¬ 
randum-book and turned the leaves. 

“ Listen to this, will you. ‘ To Pen¬ 
nyworth, on account of Bryden and 
the half-breed, $500.’ Who’s Penny¬ 
worth ? ” 

Bremerton pricked up his ears. 

“ Pennyworth is the lawyer who 
had charge of Big Steve’s and Chom- 
bo’s fight in court,” said he. “ Is there 
anything more ? ” 

“ Not a scrap; and this must have 
got in by mistake. Now you know 
who financed the defense for those 
blackguards and who’s paying pen¬ 
sions for hush-money. I guess this 
is proof enough, even if Carruthers is 
never able to speak a word.” 

Bremerton went out into the other 
room and, for a whole hour, tramped 
the floor. O’Hara knew that his loyal¬ 
ty for Deane was dying hard. At the 
end of the hour an automobile dashed 
up to the headquarters adobe and the 
doctor and the sheriff sprang out. 

“ Dr. Morton, Bremerton,” said 
Ransom. “ What does all this mean ? ” 

“ You’ll find your man in there, 
doctor,” observed the superintendent, 
nodding toward the bedroom. “ We 
have Dave Carruthers, and he’s badly 
hurt and unable to-talk. We’ll know 
more about what it all means if we can 
get some information from him.” 

“ Carruthers! He has always been 
a wildcatter, and none too strong on 
the moral points.” 

Ransom took off his hat and knocked 
the dust out of it. “ He slipped out 
of sight a few months ago, and I 
thought he had left the country. Was 
he—shot ? ” 

“ No. There was a rope over a cliff 
and he was found unconscious at the 
lower end of it.” 

Bremerton was in for some more 
explaining, but he was tactful and said 
nothing about the overhang, the lost 
vein, or Mariquita’s account of her 
father’s dealings with Deane. 

The superintendent’s recital hinged 
upon the shooting at the fork of the 
trail, his accident, the rescue by the 
girl, and the coming of O’Hara. 

The sheriff muttered an exclama¬ 
tion and thumped a fist into his palm. 

“ By gorry, we’re on the track at 
last! ” he declared. “ Carruthers, and 
not the Mallorys, has been picking this 
bone with Deane. Mallory isn’t the 
one to hide out and go sniping for 
this mine’s superintendents. But Car¬ 
ruthers could do it without the flicker 
of an eyelash. We’re getting “down to 
cases now.” 

Bremerton got the note-book and 
showed Ransom the entry regarding 
money paid to Pennyworth on account 
of Big Steve and Chombo. 


“ That cinches it! ” averred the 
sheriff. “ He was back of that crowd, 
and he wouldn’t separate himself from 
good money without a reason.” 

Dr. Morton came out of the bed¬ 
room. He had shed his coat and rolled 
up his shirt-sleeves. 

“ What’s the word, Morton ? ” 
queried Ransom. 

“ He’s done for,” was the reply. 
“ Mangled as he is, I can’t understand 
how he has lived as long as this.” 

“Will he recover consciousness? 
Do you think—” 

O’Hara showed himself suddenly at 
the bedroom door and beckoned. The 
doctor hurriedly returned to Car¬ 
ruthers and Bremerton and Ransom 
followed. The eyes of the injured 
man were wide open. After wander¬ 
ing from, face to face they came to a 
rest on the sheriff’s. 

“ You’re too late. Ransom,” said 
Carruthers faintly. “ I’ve fooled you 
for months, and now I’m off on the 
long trail and fooling you for good. 
Bremerton was more than I bar¬ 
gained for; and yet I—I came within 
one of getting him. He—” 

The voice failed. While O’Hara 
lifted Carruthers’s head, the doctor 
picked up a glass from the table and 
put it to his lips. 

CHAPTER XXI. 

THI$ MAN WHO LOST. 

“ Get a pencil and paper, Bremer¬ 
ton,” said Ransom, “ and take this 
down.” 

Carruthers’s strength rallied under 
the stimulant. There was that in his 
eyes, however, which told the others 
unmistakably it could not be for long. 
He began to talk as soon as O’H&ra 
had laid him down, and it was' all 
, around the few points which the 
sheriff wished to have made clear. 

“ I feel as though there wasn’t a 
whole bone in my body,” moaned Car¬ 
ruthers. “Why couldn’t I go out 
without realizin’ what had happened? 

What did you bring me back for, 
when I was slippin’ away so easy ? 
Now the black horror is gripping me 
by the throat, and—and—I’m scared 
of it, men, scared of it. I ain’t old! 
Thirty-eight, that’s all. And here I’m 
crossin’ the divide with the best of my 
life ahead of me! ” 

Self-pity seized him. His face 
hardened like stone and his dull eyes 
smoldered. Clenching his fists, he 
broke into gasping torrents of words 
whose import sickened those who lis¬ 
tened. Ransom laid a muffling hand 
over his mouth. 

“ In Heaven’s name, Carruthers,” 
said he, “ remember where you are. 
You haven’t long to stay. Don’t pass 
out with curses on your lips! Let 
your final act go toward undoing some 
of the wrong.” He bent down so that 
he could look in the feverish eyes. 
“ Tell me about Griggsby,” he added. 

“ That’s why you’re here, eh ? ” 
snarled Carruthers. “ Well, you might 
have saved yourself the trouble. Not 
a word about anything. I fought for 
my own against that black-hearted 
Deane.' He’s won and I’ve lost! I’d 
barter my soul for one year more of 
life—just a year.” 

He fell to raving again. O’Hara 
got up and passed into the other room. 
Returning softly with the flute, he sat 
down by the head of the bed and be¬ 
gan to play. 

It was the intermezzo from “ Caval- 
leria Rusticana.” Never had Bremer¬ 
ton heard O’Hara play as he played 
then. The tender melody floated about 
the room, and there went with it a 
rustling as of unseen wings. 

Ransom stood like a man entranced. 
Morton pulled down his sleeves and 
walked to the window. Bremerton 
bowed over his pencil and paper, 
weirdly thrilled by the pathos and the 
pleading of those whispering notes. - 

The twisted lines straightened in 
Carruthers’s face. He fell silent. 
Presently his eyes closed and he lay 
still. O’Hara made an end of the 
music and laid the flute on his knees. 


“ God! ” breathed Carruthers, open¬ 
ing his eyes. “ I’ve heard that before, 
somewhere. What piece was that? ” 

“ Only a bit of an air to make you 
see things differently,” said O’Hara. 
“ It does that for me and, by the same 
token, I thought it might for you.” 

For a second Carruthers lay think¬ 
ing. Then he turned his head so he 
could look at the Irishman. 

“ Play it again,” he begged. 

“ Sure, and as long as you please, 
but not till you’ve talked with Ran¬ 
som.” 

“ I want to know about Griggsby, 
Carruthers,” spoke up the sheriff. 
“ What you say can do you no harm.” 

“ Blame nobody but me for what 
happened to Griggsby and Lacey,” 
said Carruthers. “ The rest of the 
boys had nothin’ to do with' it. I went 
farther with Griggsby than I meant to, 
and that’s the God’s truth. 

“ I knew Mallory had struck some¬ 
thing rich at the Mariquita, and I 
wanted him to lose. I asked Deane to 
help me beat Mallory out, and he said 
he would keep him dangling until the 
last minute, and then turn him down 
cold. 

“ So he did, but not uniil he had got 
me with my back to the wall. It was 
either sell out to Mallory for the twen¬ 
ty-five thousand or to Deane at double 
that. He had me, and he knew it; but 
I swore he would never get any good 
from the mine until he deeded me a 
half interest. 

“ That is what I was fighting for, 
Ransom! For that I laid low in the 
hills, fighting the work at the Mari¬ 
quita. I did whatever I could to make 
Deane sick of his bargain, and to force 
him to come to me. I know I’d have 
had him, too, if it hadn’t been for 
Bremerton. 

“ Mallory’s girl got Bremerton away 
from us. I tried to follow them into 
the gully and find out where they went, 
but—but I slipped from the rope as 
some one fired at my men in the swale. 
That’s—all—I—” 

Carruthers’s voice died in his throat. 

He looked at O’Hara and his lips 
framed a silent word. Ransom nodded 
to O’Hara, then went to Bremerton, 
took the hastily scrawled transcript 
and read it over while the flute’s music 
once more throbbed through the room. 

Over and over, while the tide ebbed, 
O’Hara breathed the Intermezzo into 
the dead wood and warmed it into life. 
The doctor, watching Carruthers, final¬ 
ly went to the bedside and bent down 
to touch his wrist. 

“ That will be all,” said the doctor 
to O’Hara; “ he’s past hearing you.” 

The sheriff had cracked the shell of 
a troublesome mystery. His profes¬ 
sional satisfaction was jarred, a bit in-' 
congruously, by a sentiment perfectly 
human and somewhat awkward. 

“ That’s the way I’d like to go out 
myself, when I have to,” he murmured. 
“ We’ve got a melodeon to home. Give 
me the name of that piece, O’Hara, so 
I can have my daughter learn it.” 

O’Hara, with pity in his pale eyes, 
stood looking down at Carruthers. 

“ Faith,” said he, “ there’s good in 
the worst of us and bad in the best of 
us, and there’s some hope for the man 
who goes beyond with the love o’ 
music in his soul.” 

He laid the hands on the breast and 
gently drew the blanket over the face. 
“ We’re but cogs in the wheel, any¬ 
way,” he added, “ and the machine 
keeps running even if a cog here and 
there is not what it ought to be.” 

“ Come out in the other room, all of 
you,” requested the sheriff, “ while I 
read what Bremerton took down. It’s 
fresh in your minds, you know, and I 
want you to sign as witnesses.” 

They grouped about Ransom in the 
office and listened while he read. After 
that each set his hand to the document. 

“ Here’s a black spot cleared up,” 
went on Ransom. “ Beats all I never 
thought of Carruthers in this matter 
of Griggsby. But that’s the way. The 
plain truth is so plain, sometimes, we’re 
apt to dodge it.” 

He turned to Bremerton. “ Thanks 
to you, Bremerton, from this on Deane 


will have clear sailing. Do you know. 
I’m blamed glad of one thing.” 

“What’s that?” inquired Bremer¬ 
ton. 

“ Why, that the Mallorys had no 
hand in the lawlessness out here. 
There was a spell when it looked dark 
for them. No objection to having— 
that ”—-he nodded toward the bedroom 
'—“ here until I can get the underta¬ 
kers out?” 

“ Certainly not.” 

“Then suppose we hike, Morton?” 

* “ I’ll be ready in a minute, Ransom,” 
said the doctor. 

He went to the end of the pipe-line 
and washed his hands. When he had 
returned to thq office and slipped into 
his coat, the sheriff had the machine 
ready. Bremerton, meanwhile, had 
picked up a pad of telegraph blanks 
and written the following: 

Silas Deane, Denver. 

Have cleaned up on the other crowd 

and located bonanza vein on Mariquita 

property. Important you come on at 

once. Notify and will meet you Phoe- 

Bremerton. 

He went out of the office and handed 
the message to the sheriff. 

“ Send that for me, will you, Ran¬ 
som ? ” he asked. “ Let it go collect.” 

“ Glad to oblige,” 'said the sheriff. 
“ Will get it on the wires as soomas I 
hit town.” 

Bremerton and O’Hara watched the 
car vanish over the rise in the trail; 
jand then the Irishman, after a long 
look at his friend, turned on his heel 
and moved off toward the mill. 

The news spread through the camp 
that Carruthers, the man who had lo¬ 
cated the mine and added to his hold¬ 
ings until they embraced the whole 
valley and the neighboring hills, had 
gone his way and was lying in the 
headquarters adobe. 

When the day men came off duty 
and the night men went on, all eyes 
sought the little office building, awed 
and curious. The same eyes presently 
Shifted to Bremerton and paid him a 
tribute of respect and high considera¬ 
tion. 

Carruthers represented the evil pow¬ 
ers that had skulked in the hills, fight¬ 
ing Deane’s men savagely and murder¬ 
ously. With Carruthers, those powers 
had been laid low, and all the credit 
was given to Bremerton. A better 
spirit manifested itself among the 
workers. 

In the evening Bremerton and 
O’Hara carried their chairs out of the 
office and sat by the door. The Irish¬ 
man fluted the airs dearest to his heart 
and the other smoked reflectively. By 
and by the flute was laid aside and 
O’Hara himself filled a pipe and blew 
fragrant wreaths into the still air. 

“ I’ve wired for Deane,” announced 
the superintendent. 

There was no demonstration from 
O’Hara. Leaning back against the 
adobe wall he puffed serenely at his 
pipe. 

“ I say I have sent for Deane— 
asked him to come on immediately,” 
repeated Bremerton. 

“ I knew you’d do that, or go to 
Denver, one or the other,” said 
O’Hara. “What will you do, Lee?” 

“ What would you do, Mike ? ” 

“ Divil knows. I’m expecting, 
though, that you’ll keep your head and 
be sensible. None of the Lee Reckless 
in your accounting with Deane, man. 
You were to blame, along at the first, 
by getting into this so easy. Don’t for¬ 
get that.” 

“ Carruthers,” mused Bremerton, 
“got only what was coming to him. 
His fight with Deane was a case of 
diamond cut diamond, and, right or 
wrong, wouldn’t have been strained 
whichever way the cards fell. 

“ But, between the two of them, the 
Mallorys were crushed and beaten and 
flung to the scrap-heap. The rights 
most to be considered were not con¬ 
sidered at all. There’s the point that 
involves and concerns— me! I took 
Deane’s word and helped him rob the 
Mallorys of what was justly theirs.” 

Self-reproach weighed heavily in the 

words. The wrath of a man who had 
all his life tried to be square, only to 
have a friend besmirch his ideals and 
sully his honor, swirled in the tones of 
Bremerton’s voice. 

“ After all, Lee,” said O’Hara 
soothingly, “ ’tis no crime you’ve done. 
You stepped aside in taking Deane’s 
say-so, when you should have gone un¬ 
der the surface indications. We all do 
that same, more or less. When we’re 
in wrong, the part of a wise man is to 
retire gracefully and in order. Which 
is the same as saying with as little 
trouble as possible. In. my opinion, the 
Mallorys are beyond help, so far as this 
mine is concerned.” 

“ We’ll see about that! ” and Brem¬ 
erton’s face hardened and his teeth 
clicked on his pipe-stem. 

“ You’ll not take my advice, I know, 
in your present temper; but, so help me, 
I’ll be around, and I’ll have a hand in 
what happens if you go too far. Mind 
that.” 

At that juncture a long, black wagon 
rolled along the trail, turned, and came 
to a halt in front of the office. Two 
men got down from the seat and one 
approached Bremerton. 

“Mr. Bremerton?” 

“Yes.” 

“ The sheriff sent us out.” 

“ Come with me,” said Bremerton, 
and led the way into the office. 

CHAPTER XXII. 

GORMAN, OF THE NIGHT SHIFT. 

IT was next day that i. man rode out 
from town with an answer to Bremer¬ 
ton’s message. 

Shake. Knew you’d turn the trick.' 

Meet me Phoenix Friday morning. 

The superintendent smiled grimly. 
Deane was coming, and he was destined 
to receive a few surprises—not all of 
them pleasant. 

On Thursday afternoon Bremerton 
sent to the bunk-house for Gorman, the 
night amalgamator. This millman was 

the key to some things which the super¬ 
intendent wanted to know. 

Gorman usually slept in the fore¬ 
noon and loafed in the afternoon. 
Bremerton’s messenger found him, and 
he came straight to the office. 

He was a rat-eyed, weasel-faced little 
man whose main object in life seemed 
to be to keep out of sight. The most 
devious way between two points was 
the shortest for Gorman. 

He entered the office so silently that 
Bremerton did not know he was there 
until he was seen beside the desk. 

“ On deck, Mr. Bremerton,” said 
Gorman nervously. 

“ Sit down,” said the superintend¬ 
ent. 

The millman cuddled into a chair and 
looked about him shiftily. He had the 
air of one who was expecting some¬ 
thing disagreeable to happen. 

“If you’re under the impression, 
Gorman, that I don’t know you’re a 
thief, you are mistaken.” 

The quiet, conversational tone was 
weirdly out of harmony with the sen¬ 
timent expressed. Bremerton’s man¬ 
ner disarmed Gorman for a moment, 
and then, when the burden of the words 
had sunk in, he bristled angrily. 

“ Nobody can talk to me like that, 
by gorry! Insults like them I never 
stood for and never will. Gi’me my 
time.” 

“ Don’t be a fool,” returned Brem¬ 
erton. “ You know that, if you had 
your deserts, you’d have been caught 
in the same net that snared Big Steve 
and Chombo. While Steve was here, 
you turned in no more amalgam than he 
did; since he’s been gone, you’ve been 
turning in three times as much as you 
did before. I was pretty sure you 
were stealing, but I had no time to 
bother with you. Now that you’re 
evidently playing fair, I have no incli¬ 
nation to make you trouble. All I 
want you to do is to talk.” 

Some men with a guilty conscience 
can bluff successfully. Gorman was 
not one of that kind. For long he had 
been afraid he was suspected. 


“ I ain't admitting a thing,” said 
Gorman ; “ but what do you want me 
to talk about ? ” 

“ Where were you on the night I 
reached Phoenix ? King was in charge 
here, and somebody had brought a 
supply of whisky into camp. Not 
much work was going on. I guess you 
remember.” 

The millman wriggled uncomfort¬ 
ably. 

“ I don’t get you at all,” he an¬ 
swered. “ I been at the Mariquita right 
along.” 

“ Don’t hem and haw and side-step,” 
returned Bremerton. “ I’m not intend¬ 
ing to take any action against you. I’ll 
be more kindly disposed, however, if 
you come out square-toed and tell me 
what you know. Were you and Big 
Steve directly connected with Car- 
ruthers ? ” 

Gorman took a. red cotton handker¬ 
chief from his pocket and drew it across 
his face. He was undergoing an or¬ 
deal, and showed it. 

“ I’m straight now, Mr. Bremer¬ 
ton,” he whimpered. “ I’m tryin’ to do 
what’s right. You ain’t going to put 
me through if I tell the truth? ” 

“ No.” 

“ Do I get .fired ? ” 

“ Not so long as you keep straight.” 

“ Well, then, Chombo worked with 
Carruthers, and Big Steve worked with 
Chombo, and I worked with Steve. 
That’s the gospel of it, and I’ll kiss the 
Book. I didn’t want to go in on it. 
Backed away from the propersition for 
quite a spell. Steve allowed, though, 
that they was going to get their toll of 
amalgam from the night shift, and if 
I didn’t come over, then some night I’d 
turn up missin’ and there’d be an amal¬ 
gamator in my place they could depend 
on. I was scared into it, Mr. Bremer¬ 
ton; that’s all.” 

“ Who disposed of the amalgam ? ” 

“ Chombo got it to Carruthers, and 
he turned it into cash. We all got our 
whack, and it was purty profitable. 
When Chombo had the pin pulled on 
him, Steve sneaked the stuff out of 
camp. But I reckon you know about 
that.” 

“ Have you any idea why the stuff 
jvas cached at Oak Flat? ” 

“ It wasn’t always cached there; 
Chombo picked out that place.” 

“Why?” 

“ I don’t know only what I heard 
'from Big Steve.” 

“ What did you hear ? ” 

“ Why, that if you found out any¬ 
thin’, Carruthers wanted to make it 
look bad for the Mallorys.” 

“ H-m! ” murmured Bremerton and 
sat back in his chair. Following a mo¬ 
ment's reflection, he went on: “Who 
left the Mariquita Mine that night the 
crowd beat me up at the Phoenix town- 
ditch?” 

“Not me,” said Gorman hastily; 
“ I wasn’t among ’em.” 

“Was Steve Bryden in the gang? ” 

“ No. Steve was jest gittin’ busy 
yvith the likker. I heard that Chombo 
was with that outfit. I’m purty sure 
no one else from the camp had a hand 
in the doings.” 

“A ball of amalgam was dropped 
by one of the crowd.” 

“ Then it was Chombo dropped it. 
He was holdin’ out a little on Car¬ 
ruthers right along.” 

Thus one dark point was cleared 
up. Bremerton believed that the fel¬ 
low he had knocked into the canal was 
Chombo. 

“What men did Carruthers have 
with him out in the hills? Do you 
know that, Gorman?” 

“ They was men who had been 
bounced from the mine. Griggsby let 
one or two go, and Lacey ditched the 
others. Carruthers gathered ’em in, 
and they was more than willin’ to help 
him. He made it worth their while.” 

“ Where are those men now? ” 

“ Why, when Carruthers went out 
them fellers began to run—and I al¬ 
low they’re still a runnin’. You can 
gamble a blue stack they won’t show 
up around here no more, Mr. Bremer¬ 
ton.” 

“ I can’t think of anything else, 


Gorman,” said the. superintendent. 
“ You’re in luck to come out of that 
amalgam deal as well as you have. 
Keep that in mind. That will be all.” 

The millman arose and passed soft¬ 
ly toward the door. He halted there 
for a final word. 

“ I’m to stay on and have no 
trouble? ” 

“ So long as you do the right thing, 
Gorman, you needn’t worry.” 

“ I know I’m in luck, and I’m stand- 
in’ pat on an honest deal. Much 
obliged to you, Mr. Bremerton.” 

He faded out of the office, and the 
superintendent was positive that the 
fangs of Deane’s last enemy had been 
drawn. From that time on there 
would be only clear sailing for those 
in charge of the Mariquita Mine. 
Everything was propitious for that 
final accounting with Deane. 

Thursday afternoon Bremerton had 
Dutch Fred put a pair of cayuses to 
the pole of the mine buckboard. When 
the rig was ready, and the superintend¬ 
ent was about to climb into it for the 
ride to Phoenix, O’Hara came down 
from the mill. 

“ You’re off after Deane, Bremer¬ 
ton? ” asked the Irishman. 

“ Yes,” was the answer. “ He’ll 
reach Phoenix in the morning, and I 
intend to bring the rest of this busi¬ 
ness to a close in short order.” 

A worried look crossed O’Hara’s 
face. __ 

“ It’s not your plan, is it, to do any¬ 
thing in Phoenix or on the way out ? ” 
he continued. 

There had been something that Bre¬ 
merton had wanted to say to his friend 
for several days. Here was a good 
time for it. 

“ Mike, you’re not my guardian. 
No man could ask for a better friend, 
but there is a dead line which even a 
friend cannot cross without making 
trouble. My business with Deane is 
my own affair, and I’m going to han¬ 
dle it in my own way without let or 
hindrance from you. Don’t meddle. 
Keep hands off.” 

“ I’ll not let that hot head of yours 
take you to the divil entirely,” flared 
O’Hara. “ So help me, I’ll not have 
you doing time for roughing it with 
a yellow dog like Deane. Smoke that 
in your pipe.” 

O’Hara turned back to the mill. 
Bremerton stared after him specula¬ 
tively, then climbed into the buck- 
board and drove away. 

At the fork in the trail he was sur¬ 
prised to find Mariquita mounted on 
her horse and evidently waiting for 
him. She rode out into the road 
ahead of his team. 

“You have asked Deane to come 
here! ” she exclaimed. 

“ It was necessary,” he returned. 
“ You get your information direct 
from Denver, I suppose?” 

“ You already know, Mr. Bremer¬ 
ton, that we have a friend in Deane’s 
Denver office. Why, why have you 
done this ? ” 

She spoke vehemently, passionate¬ 
ly, and clearly was doubtful of Brem¬ 
erton’s motives. 

“ I told you, Miss Mallory, that 
you would have to trust me,” he said 
calmly. “ You are not doing it.” 

“ You have sent for Deane to show 
him that—that lost lead ? ” 

“ Yes. I want him to understand 
that the work he gave me to do has 
been accomplished.” 

“ How will that help us? ” she 
cried. “ By showing him how valua¬ 
ble the mine is, how are you going to 
benefit my father and me ? ” 

“ I have my plans. You know 
Deane pretty well, and I guess you 
realize that what I have ahead of me 
is anything but child’s play. I am go¬ 
ing to do what I can. That, Miss Mal¬ 
lory, is all any man can do. Are you 
going to lose confidence in me ? ” 

She rode alongside the buckboard 
and leaned sidewise to offer her hand. 

“ No,” she said softly and with a 
wan smile, “ for you are the only one 
who can do anything with Deane. 
Help us, and it will be worth your 
while. If you win an interest for us 


in the property, I have come to tell 
you that a part of it will be yours.” 

He dropped the hand as though a 
serpent had stung him. 

“ You dorjT know me very well,” 
he answered. “ I can’t be bribed, 
Miss Mallory, and I’m sorry you 
thought so.” 

He picked up the lines and drove 
on. Until he was out of sight the girl 
sat motionless in the saddle, looking 
after him. 

Bremerton had work that evening 
in Phoenix. He called on a lawyer 
and had a certain paper filled out and 
made ready for signing. 

On his way back to the hotel he 
stepped into a hardware - store and 
bought a small revolver to take the 
place of the “ automatic ” he had lost. 

The dealer wanted to sell him a box 
of • cartridges. Bremerton, however, 
did not buy. 

“ AH I want is the revolver,” he 
said. 

With the legal paper in the breast 
of his coat and the unloaded revolver 
in his hip-pocket, he retraced his way 
to the hotel. 


CHAPTER XXIII. 

DEANE ARRIVES. 

The train from the north was due 
at seven o’clock. It rolled up to the 
station promptly on time, and Deane 
was the last passenger to get out of the 
Pullman. The porter obsequiously 
handed him a black Boston bag, re¬ 
ceiving in exchange for it a silver 
dollar. 

The mining king was a picturesque 
figure as he came down the platform. 
His black Stetson, long-tailed coat, 
and flowing tie compelled attention. 

A wonderful diamond sparkled in 
the white frills of his shirt and a 
massive chain wriggled across the 
front of his low-cut vest. Another 
stone, conspicuous for size and bril¬ 
liancy, was very much in evidence on 
the third finger of his left hand. 

Good living and lack of exercise had 
doubled his girth since the prospecting 
days with Bremerton. His walk was 
the cautious, flat-footed waddle of the 
fat man, although he carried it off 
with a touch of distinction. 

.All in all, he was a most impressing 
spectacle. It was plain that he knew 
it, and equally plain that he liked it. 
His money had brought with it power 
and influence, and no man was more 
in the Western lime-light. 

The reporters for three different 
newspapers had reached him ahead of 
Bremerton. They wanted interviews. 

“ Blamed if I can travel a dozen 
miles out of Denver without having a 
bunch of you cimarrons tight at my 
heels,” he complained good-naturedly. 
“ Now, boys, I haven’t a pesky thing 
for you to put in the papers. Maybe 
I’ll have news for you before I leave. 
If I have, I promise to herd you all 
together, treat every one fair, and not 
play favorites. Try one of these, will 
you, and just forget I’m in town till 
I’m ready to loosen up.” 

He drew a silver-mounted cigar- 
case from the breast of his coat and 
offered it around. Then he caught 
sight of Bremerton. 

“ Howdy, pard! ” he cried, break¬ 
ing away from the newspapermen, 
dropping his satchel and grabbing the 
tall, gaunt figure in corduroys with 
both hands. 

“ You done it, by thunder, and ’way 
this side of the six months! Lee, 
you’re the clear quill. Looking finer’n 
silk, too. What did I say, huh? Did 
I know what I was doing, or didn’t I ? 
Where’s a cab? Let’s go to the hotel 
and sit in at the chuck-table. I’m 
hungrier’n a Ute squaw on govern¬ 
ment rations.” 

Bremerton picked up the satchel, 
Deane hooked arms with him, and 
they went on to the waiting line of 
carriages. A little later they were be¬ 
ing hurried to the best hotel in town, 
Deane talking effusively and giving 
his friend no chance for a word. 

There was the plaza, same old 


court-house plaza, where he and 
Bremerton had sat in the shade years 
ago, wondering where they would 
strike for next. Yes, and, by gorry, 
there was the same identical umhrella 
tree they had sat under. Didn’t it 
beat all how the old times came back? 

Below the corner of First Avenue 
was the wall of the town corral where 
they had kept their burros; and say— 
wouldn’t it rattle your spurs?—right 
there was Coffee Al’s, where they had 
spent many a quarter for grub. Good 
grub, too; better grub than any Deane 
had ever had since — or, anyhow, it 
tasted better. 

“ I guess it’s a sure-enough fact, 
Lee,” philosophized Deane, “ that the 
more money you got to spend for 
things, the less you appreciate ’em. 
Oh, them sure was good days! ” 

The mining king sat back into his 
coat and relapsed into a mood of flab¬ 
by and morbid reminiscence. He came 
out of it shortly and dropped a fat, 
friendly hand on Bremerton’s knee. 

“ Why don’t you tune up, old part¬ 
ner ? ” he asked. “ I don’t reckon 
you’ve peeped since we got together.” 

The recollection of old times, when 
Deane was different and a comrade 
worth having, had wrenched hard at 
the purpose Bremerton had in mind. 
He brushed the feeling aside and 
looked into his friend’s face with a 
smile. 

“ I’ve been holding my tongue and 
listening to you, Silas,” he answered. 
“ Not much chance for me to put in a 
word when you get started.” 

“ That’s right, I guess that’s right,” 
and Deane chuckled. “ This is a regu¬ 
lar picnic for me. Old scenes, old 
friends, and a pot of money into the 
bargain. Enough to make a fellow 
grow young and feel his oats, eh ? ” 

They got down at the hotel and 
Deane handed the black bag to a wait¬ 
ing boy. 

“ Careful with that, son,” he 
warned. “ There’s two pint bottles of 
old Scotch in that grip, and if any¬ 
thing happens- to ’em I’m ruined.” 

Deane wrote his name on the regis¬ 
ter. He began placing Bremerton’s 
under it, but the latter protested. 

“ I’m booked at another hotel,” said 
he. 

“ You’re going to be booked at this 
one, too. We’re going to have break¬ 
fast together.” 

“ I’ve already had breakfast.” 

“ Why didn’t you wait ? Dash it, 
you’re treating me like a hired man 
more than a pard. You’ll eat again, 
that’s all.” 

Bremerton’s name went down, and 
Deane insisted that he accompany him 
up to his room. The black bag was 
opened, and Deane pulled out a flannel 
shirt, a slouch hat, a pair of khaki 
trousers, and a pair of laced knee- 
boots. He laughed like a boy as he 
showed the outfit. 

“ Bet your life, old pard, I brought 
my war clothes along. After I eat I’m 
going to get into ’em, and you and me 
will go pottering off into the hills same 
as we used to. Great! ” 

“ It won’t be hardly the same, Si,” 
said Bremerton. “ Instead of walking 
and driving our pack-burros we’ll ride 
in a buckboard.” 

“ Haven’t they got any automobiles 
in this man’s town ? ” 

“ Automobiles are a cultivated taste, 
and the superintendent at the Mari- 
quita can’t afford so much style. 
You’re only a counterfeit at this old- 
time game, Deane. Two days of the 
old life would kill you.” 

“ Maybe you’re right. Help your¬ 
self to this—every swig is warranted 
to take ten years off your shoulders. 
It’s prime. A man in Denver gets it 
for me special.” 

Bremerton did not drink. He want¬ 
ed a clear Jiead while he was with 
Deane. While his fri'end’s back was 
turned he unscrewed the cap and let it 
go at that. Deane faced around, took 
the flask out of his hands, and helped 
himself generously. 

In a few minutes they went down to 
breakfast together. Deane raided the 
bill of fare while Bremerton content¬ 


ed himself with a cup of coffee and 
griddle-cakes. 

Not much was said about the mine. 
It was a subject for private discussion, 
and that dining-room was altogether 
too public a place. 

After the meal Bremerton left 
Deane to get into his “ war clothes ” 
and went after the team and buck- 
board. It was ten o’clock before they 
took the trail into the hills. 

“ Now,” remarked Deane, when 
they had left the town well behind 
them, “ we can get down to cases, Lee. 
You’ve pleased me a heap the way 
you’ve managed things. Old Griggs- 
by was a false alarm and Lacey was a 
weak sister. You grabbed the big diffi¬ 
culties by the scruff of the neck and 
chucked ’em into the discard. Knew 
you would.” 

This, in few words, was Deane’s 
estimate of the man who had died try¬ 
ing to serve him, and of the other who 
had gone down to physical wreck in 
his employ. 

“ You don’t know what Griggsby 
would have done if your enemies 
hadn’t picked him off,” said Bremerton 
sharply; “ and Lacey is a whole man; 
I’ve seen him and I know.” 

“ Oh, well, yes, if you want it that 
way,” returned Deane impatiently. 
“ Success, though, is the only thing 
that counts. You pulled the old work¬ 
ings through to gloty, and there wasn’t 
much fuss about it, either. Reel that 
off to me.” 

Bremerton proceeded to “ reel it 
off.” He took a good deal of satisfac¬ 
tion in making the case as bad as it 
was. 

Beginning with the assault by the 
town canal, he followed with the cap¬ 
ture of Steve and Chombo, then told 
of the shot at the fork of the trail, and 
finished with the fate of Carruthers. 

Skilfully he left Mariquita Mallory 
out of the narrative. Not once was 
her name mentioned. His discovery 
of the lost lead was dealt with indefi¬ 
nitely—treated as an accident. 

For all this he had his reasons. 

Mariquita and her father would be¬ 
come prominent enough before he was 
through with the mining king. 

Deane was absorbed in the recital. 
The fire went out of his cigar again 
and again. He breathed hard in the 
pinches, and by the town canal and at 
the fork in the trail his fat hands 
clenched and he swore under his 
breath. 

But his fat face beamed while 
Bremerton was describing that foot¬ 
wide vein back of the overhang. 

“ I’ll take my oath, Lee,” he com¬ 
mented earnestly, when the telling was 
done, “ I never thought Carruthers 
would rough things up like that! 
(What's become of the law in these 
parts, anyhow ? Can’t it protect a man 
in keeping his own? Never mind that, 
though. A miss is as good as a mile, 
and you skinned the gang! It makes 
my blood sing just to hear you palaver 
about it.' A month’s running on that 
bonanza ore and the mine’s as good 
as sold. Half a million, by thunder, 
and it cost me only fifty thousand. 
That’s business, Bremerton. That’s 
the way to get rich.” 

There were no regrets for that 
mound over Griggsby in the Phoenix 
cemetery, and not a word of commis¬ 
eration for the unlucky Lacey. 

Deane’s eye was single to that half 
million. It completely filled his per¬ 
spective. - Bremerton knew that if he 
5had fallen at the fork of the trail his 
money-grubbing friend would have ex¬ 
perienced few twinges and few regrets. 

The roar of flood waters in Arapa¬ 
hoe Canon was almost silenced. Deane 
had strangled his finer sentiments with 
a rope of gold. The Deane that was 
and the Deane who now sat at Bremer¬ 
ton’s side in the buckboard were two 
different men. 

This realization did much to recon¬ 
cile Bremerton to the course he had 
mapped out for himself. In the inter¬ 
ests of right and justice he could 
deal with this swaggering, purse-proud 
trickster as he could not have dealt 
,;with his old, loyal prospector-friend. 


Deane offered Bremerton a cigar. 
Bremerton declined, and filled and 
lighted his pipe. For some time they 
traveled in silence. Finally Deane 
aroused to observe: 

“ I consider, Bremerton, that an¬ 
other month of you at the mine will 
be enough. I’m getting out for fifteen 
hundred less than I calculated on. 
Eh?” 

The superintendent’s eyes narrowed. 
“ What’s that? ” he asked. 

Deane repeated his words. Brem¬ 
erton had heard them plainly enough 
the first time, but he wanted them re¬ 
peated. 

“ You mean,” said he, “ that I was 
hired for six months for three thpu- 
sand dollars, and that, inasmuch as I 
have made good in half the time, I am 
only entitled to half pay. Is that it? ” 

“ Something like that,” replied 
Deane, giving a canny glance out of 
the tails of his eyes. 

“ Are you going to split the ten- 
thousand-dollar bonus in two as 
well?/’ asked Bremerton dryly. 

“ Well, what do you think? ” 

“ I don’t know, Deane. I shall have 
to give it a little reflection.” 

“ Of course I intend to do the right 
thing,” burst out the other in a flurry 
of virtuous determination. “ I’ll not 
be small with a friend, and you can 
gamble a blue stack on that. Think it 
over, old pard. I’ll leave it to you. 
Whatever you say is right goes with 
Deane.” 

Here was the final straw. For risk¬ 
ing his life, for robbing the Mallorys, 
for making the mine worth half a 
million, Deane could haggle with his 
old friend over the paltry sum that 
was to be paid! 

Yes, certainly, Bremerton would 
think it over! 


CHAPTER XXIV. 

TIGHTENING THE COIE. 

A flurry of excitement passed 
through the camp with the arrival of 



Deane. Every worker wanted a look 
at the “ big boss.” He was discussed 
frankly by a few. These maintained 
that he won his games by jumping men 
over the business checker-board, sacri¬ 
ficing ruthlessly in his dash for the 
king-row. 

They said that his employees were 
catspaws for pulling his golden chest¬ 
nuts out of the fire; that he had not the 
nerve for executing his own schemes; 
that he bought men in open, market 
and played them selfishly and unscru¬ 
pulously for his own lawless gain. 

Talk of this kind, however, left no 
sentiment of disgust or disapproval in 
its train. Deane’s success and his 
wealth dazzled the eyes and confused 
the understanding. The mining king 
was a rugged and prominent figure all 
up and down the Pacific slope, and men 
shut their eyes to his past and gave him 
a hand for what he was. 

O’Hara took no part in the buzzing 
gossip in the mill. He listened pas¬ 
sively while Giles and the engineer 
shouted confidences to each other about 
the mine-owner. The Irishman had 
tact as well as the courage of his con¬ 
victions. 

In the late afternoon Deane and 
Bremerton visited the blind gully and 
searched out a place where the visitor 
could be lowered with least danger 
and physical effort to himself. Then 
they went to the overhang and exam¬ 
ined the bonanza lead. 

Deane was astounded, overjoyed. 
He talked of running up the price on 
the syndicate, and of profiting more 
largely by his superintendent’s work. 
His greed outran his delight, and his 
stuffy voice jingled with prospective 
dollars. 

He swaggered up and down the tun¬ 
nel. He bragged about what he had 
and what he was going to have, the 
things he had done and the things he 
would do; and he wound up with: 

“ Dam it, Bremerton, I don’t know 
but I’ll take the bit in my teeth and 
insist on giving you every sou of that 
ten thousand! ” 


They returned to the mine in time 
for supper, and Deane insisted on sit¬ 
ting at table with the grimy, sweat- 
stained workers. 

He tried to be a good fellow, and 
monopolized the conversation with 
jokes and witticisms. The jokes were 
coarse and the witticisms far-fetched, 
but they never failed to draw a laugh. 

Following supper, and cigars smoked 
in front of the headquarters adobe, 
Bremerton made ready to tighten the 
coil. As a preliminary step, he invited 
Deane to step into the office. 

O’Hara’s respect for himself would 
not allow of association with Deane. 
He kept away from the headquarters 
adobe, but watched it carefully from 
the shadow of the blink-house. 

When the mine-owner and the su¬ 
perintendent retired into the office the 
Irishman approached the little mud- 
walled building and took up his posi¬ 
tion at a point where the mumbling 
voices reached his ears. 

The matter of what Bremerton was 
about to do worried h’im. He knew 
his friend so well that he was expect¬ 
ing drastic measures; and these, he 
was confident, Deane would fight. 
Out of that clash what was to come? 

When the voices grew high, when 
passion pitched them in the high key 
that meant a narrowing of argument 
and a resort to force, O’Hara was 
planning to interfere. 

Bremerton might go too far with 
Deane—it was conceivable—and the 
Irishman would step in and call a halt 
before his friend went to extremes. 

While biding his time, with every 
nerve tense and every faculty alert, 
O’Hara heard a sound of galloping. 
He sprang into the trail and was sud¬ 
denly confronted by Mariquita Mal¬ 
lory. 

“ Saints defend us! ” he gasped. 
“ Miss Mallory, you will please for¬ 
give me for saying it, but this is no 
place for you.” 

“Where is Mr. Bremerton?” the 
girl demanded; “where is Deane? I 
want to talk with them. I watched 

while Deane was taken inter the gully 
and shown the bonanza lead, and I 
came here to do what I can to get our 
rights. 1 ” 

“ Och, wurra, what a night it is! ” 
sighed O’Hara. “Will you be. listen¬ 
ing to me. Miss Mallory? It will do 
you no good to see Deane. Bremer¬ 
ton has him in the office now, and will 
fight it out with him!- He has his 
plans — divil knows what they are — 
and if Bremerton can’t do anything 
then nobody can. Will you please go 
away? I’m afraid for you here.” 

“ I’ll not go* away,” she declared. 
“ I’ll stay on the ground till it’s set¬ 
tled. Why are .you: here, Air. 
O’Hara? ” 

“ Faith, now, it’s just td be handy 
in case I’m needed. A better man 
than Bremerton never lived, and I 
can’t let him get the worst of any¬ 
thing or—” 

“You think he’s in danger?” mur¬ 
mured Mariquita quickly; “ you think 
he’s risking his life trying to get our 
rights for us?” 

“ Never — not in the- way you 
mean,” and O’Hara laughed shortly. 
“ Why, Lee could take this fat mining 
king with one hand and strangle the 
breath out of him. Begorry, it’s that, 
or something like it, that worries me. 
That’s the worst of the law, do you 
mind? You can’t kill a human, 
coyote though he is and no matter 
what he deserves, without complica¬ 
tions with sheriffs and courts and 
prison walls. If necessary, I’m here 
to save Bremerton from that.” 

“ Then I’ll stay with you and help 
you.” 

In spite of his protests she stayed, 
leaving her horse by the corral and 
then sitting beside O’Hara on the 
rock-heap where he had posted him¬ 
self. They listened silently to the' 
drone of voices, and once Deane’s 
tones rose high and his words came 
to them distinctly. 

“You’re working for me! What 
are the Mallorys to you that you’re so 
keen for them?” 


Mariquita’s hand clutched O’Hara’s 
ofrm convulsively and a sharp breath 
fluttered through her lips. 

“ He’ll stand to his guns, this 
Bremerton,” whispered O’Hara. “ I 
know him, I tell you.” 

Again Deane lifted his angry voice. 

“ You’re a d— traitor, that’s what 
you are! You was on the rocks and 
I gave you a chance. This is what I 
get for it! ” 

“ The likes of him to be talking to 
Bremerton like that! ” gritted O’Hara. 
“ Here’s where I begin expecting 
trouble. Don’t say anything, don’t do 
anything; just listen and leave it to 
me, Miss Mallory.” 

So, anxious and apprehensive, they 
waited and listened. Meanwhile, in 
the office matters were approaching a 
climax. 

Deane had followed Bremerton into 
the office wonderingly. There was 
that in Bremerton’s face which Deane 
remembered to have seen there out 
around San Simone once when they 
were cornered by Mexicans bent oil 
taking their burros and camp equip¬ 
ment. The look and manner of the 
superintendent puzzled Deane. 

Bremerton lighted the lamp and 
placed it on top of the desk; then he 
waved Deane to a chair. 

“ Silas,” said Bremerton bantering- 
ly, “ you’re a shrewd one. You- 
wouldn’t tell me in Denver how you 
got hold of the Mariquita Mine. I 
asked you if it was a square deal, you 
remember, and you said it was.” 

“Well, wasn’t it?” 

“ It was clever,” and a false note 
of admiration rang in Bremerton’? 
voice. “ You kept Mallory dangling 
while you put on a side deal with 
Carruthers.” 

“ Mallory was an old fool,” chuck¬ 
led Deane, whose ear was too gross 
to detect the false note. “ I let him 
nibble and then jerked the bait away 
from him. But I didn’t do that, by 
thunder, until it was too-late for him 
to raise the money in other quarters. 

“ Carruthers was harder to man- 
age. He was as big a fool, though, 
as Mallory. He could have extended 
the time for Mallory, but he was 
afraid. I had offered him twenty-five 
thousand better than Mallory was to 
give him, and his greed got the better 
cf his common sense. Then, after it 
was all over, Carruthers got sore and 
began to holler. A lot of good that 
did him.” 

Bremerton sat quietly and listened 
and marveled. This was his old 
friend who was talking, a man who 
had shared his blanket and his waver¬ 
ing fortunes for years! 

“ Here’s something for you to 
store up for future use, Bremerton,” 
went on Deane, with the air of one 
who wished to see another prosper 
along the lines he had made his own. 

“ You’ve seen how I pulled this off. 
Quit being so blamed conscientious 
and profit by the lesson. Get busy on 
a scheme of your own. Nothing on 
earth to hinder you from getting 
where I am but your fool notions 
about what’s right and what’s wrong. 
Do the other fellow for a spell and 
don’t let him do you. Sabe?” 

“ Oh, I sabe, all right! ” answered 
Bremerton. “ Maybe it seems strange 
to you, Deane; but I’d rather have my 
fool notions than all your pile of dirty 
dollars.” 

“ What’s that ? ” snapped the other. 
“ You’re willing enough to take my 
dirty dollars, by thunder! Yes, and 
you helped me here. Don’t forget 
that. You’re really the one who put 
this scheme across. That lost lead 
will do the trick. Griggsby couldn’t 
find it, and Lacey couldn’t find it. 
Y ou got onto it, and you were my last 
bet.” 

“ You’ve paid me a thousand dol¬ 
lars,” continued the superintendent. 
“ Here’s the money. I don’t want it.” 

He flung the package of bank-notes 
brought to him by O’Hara on the 
table in front of Deane. The latter 
grew red and apoplectic. 

“What’s this, what’s this?” he 
muttered choppily. 


“ It’s the- money you have paid me. 
Now, you can’t throw it in my face 
that I’ve profited by your dirty work. 
My hands are clean for what’s to 
come. I have something also to tell 
you, Deane. I want to appeal to your 
sense of justice—if you have any left 
in your gold-seared soul. 

“ It was Mariquita Mallory who 
saved me from Carruthers that morn¬ 
ing at the fork of the trail. My horse 
was dragging me through the swale. 
She stopped the brute.. Yes, and when 
Carruthers and his gang were shoot¬ 
ing at us and driving us from cover 
to cover, Mariquita Mallory took me 
into the gully. 

“We would have been picked off 
by the bullets had she not led me un¬ 
der the overhang. That is how I 
came to discover the lost vein. It 
would never have been found other¬ 
wise, and this property would have 
continued to be nothing more than a 
poor proposition and dear at the fifty 
thousand you paid for it had Miss 
Malory not taken me into that tunnel.” 

Deane stared at Bremerton, his lit¬ 
tle eyes glimmering. But he had not 
a word to say. 

“ You see how it is, Deane,” the su¬ 
perintendent continued. “ Merely as 
a matter of right, a simple case of 
justice, I’m asking you to deed a half 
interest in the mine to Mariquita Mal¬ 
lory.” 

When that had taken length, 
breadth, and depth in Deane’s mine he 
gave vent to a roar of wrath. 

“ You’re working for me! What 
are the Mallorys to you that you’re so 
keen for them? ” 

“ I’m not working for you, Silas. 
To-night I resign. Carruthers is out 
of the running, the bonanza ledge is 
found, and there is nothing between 
you and half a million but a little time 
for putting rich ore through the mill. 
I want to say, however, that I am not 
going to help you rob the Mallorys 
when all the credit is due the girl. Get 
that?” 

Deane gave vent to another roar 
and floundered out of his chair. He 
shook a fat fist at his old friend and 
leaned across the table to shout: 

“ You’re a traitor, that’s what you 
are! You was on the rocks and I gave 
you a chance. That is what I get 
for it! ” 

CHAPTER XXV. 

AT THE HAND OF A FRIEND. 

Bremerton’s gray eyes gleamed 
like polished steel. In just one second 
he was all energy and flaming resolu¬ 
tion. A bound landed him on his feet, 
and he threw himself half across the 
table to look into Deane’s face. 

“ Yes, I’m a traitor,” he said be¬ 
tween his teeth. “ The best thing I’ve 
done since I came to the Mariquita 
Mine is to turn against you. The Silas 
Deane of five years ago is dead; you’re 
not even the shell of him. You’re a 
knave, a thief, and a liar! Don’t you 
make a move, Deane. Sit down— 
there, at my desk! ” 

A move of the right hand and 
Bremerton was looking over the sights 
of a revolver. Deane’s little eyes grew 
filmy, the purple died from his flabby 
cheeks and left them a sickly, pasty 
white. 

This mining king had never been a 
coward. He knew Bremerton, how¬ 
ever. That voice, that look, meant that 
Bremerton was no longer Bremerton, 
but Lee Reckless. 

The change from the quiet, self- 
restrained man to another whose will 
%as his only law, and whose hand 
would stop at nothing, had been con¬ 
summated in a flash. 

Deane slumped heavily against the 
table. Slowly he raised a hand. 

“ For Heaven’s sake, Bremerton,” 
he whispered hoarsely, “ come out of 
that! I’m your old partner—remember 
Arapahoe Canon? Remember them 
days when we—” 

“ Sit down! ” 

The command was sharp and metal¬ 
lic, like the snapping of a trigger. 


Deane wheezed and rolled backward 
into a chair. The point of the revolver 
followed him. 

“ Is this what you got me out here 
for,” he mumbled — “ to threaten and 
bullyrag me on my own property ? ” 

“ I brought you out here, you miser¬ 
able excuse for the man I used to know, 
to force you to do one thing—just one 
thing —that you can look back on with¬ 
out regret when you take the Long 
Trail. Do you think my nerve will fail, 
and that I will hang back? Say! ” 

Deane’s thick shoulders quivered. 
He crouched forward, his elbows on 
the desk, and spoke weakly over his 
shoulder: 

“ No! In your present temper you’d 
—you’d do anything.” 

“ That’s the right point to start on. 
Don’t get me wrong. And don’t you 
dare mention Arapahoe Canon! The 
words, in your mouth, are an insult to 
the Silas Deane who was my friend. 
You killed him, you bragging, murder¬ 
ous hound! For that alone you’re not 
fit to live! ” 

“ You’re—you’re crazy,” came gur- 
glingly from Deane. 

“ I’ve worked for you here; I’ve 
risked my neck for you; and I’ve given 
back the money for which I sold my¬ 
self. Before I wash my hands of you, 
though, there’s one thing more.” 

Bremerton groped for the breast of 
his coat with his left hand. Not once 
did he take his gleaming eyes off Deane. 

“ There’s a deed to a half-interest in 
the Mariquita Mine,” Bremerton went 
on. “ You’ll sign and convey a part 
of this property to the person who is 
entitled to all of it — Mariquita Mal¬ 
lory.” 

He flung the document down on the 
desk. This blow at the mine-owner’s 
most vulnerable point brought back his 
courage—for a moment. 

“ Not if you kill me! ” he muttered. 
“ It’s my property, and you’ll not rob 
me. A deed like that wouldn’t hold 
good in law nohow! Haven’t you 
sense enough to know that ? ” 

“ It will hold good—this deed. 

You’ll never dispute it. If you try that, 
you’ll know that I’m alive and camped 
on your trail. Pick up that pen and 
sign your name! ” 

Again Deane turned his ghastly face 
over his shoulder. The muzzle of a 
blued barrel was within a yard of him, 
and back of the barrel was a man 
primed with a reckless disregard of 
consequences. 

Deane’s hands trembled. He picked 
up the paper and bowed close to read it. 
It fell from his shaking fingers and 
dropped to the floor. 

“ I’ll—I’ll sign under protest,” said 
Deane. “ Pick it up for me.” 

“ Get it yourself. I’m wise to your 
tricks.” 

Deane bent over, grunting and 
wheezing. The chair slipped from 
under him and he went to his knees. 
Then, reaching for the deed with his 
left hand, he brought his right to the 
front of the blue flannel shirt. The 
thick fingers caught at a hand-grip. 

The sharp-eyed Bremerton caught 
the move, but it was too late to inter¬ 
fere. The table was between him and 
Deane. 

* “ Oh, you cur! ” cried Bremerton; 
“ you shadow of the man that—” 

Deane pressed a trigger. A bullet 
tore its way through the front of his 
shirt and ranged upward over his left 
arm. Bremerton’s hands dropped, and 
he swayed a moment. 

“ Tricky to — the last! ” he gasped. 
“ That gun—under the shirt—I didn’t 
know—” 

He fell sprawling backward with a 
force that made the adobe walls shiver 
and sent the lamp-flame flaring into the 
chimney. A scream came from some¬ 
where. Deane did not hear it. Ap¬ 
proaching footsteps crunched the 
gravel. And Deane did not hear them. 

Mechanically he picked up the deed 
and straightened erect. Walking 
around the table, he stood looking 
down on Bremerton with staring, un¬ 
comprehending eyes. 

O’Hara sprang furiously into the 
room out of the night. One look at the 


form on the floor and he jumped at 
Deane. 

“ I thought it was you, not Bremer¬ 
ton ! ” he cried. “ I’ll kill you for 
this! ” 

“ No,” rasped Deane, lifting his re¬ 
volver and leveling it. “ You’ll not kill 
me. Stand where you are! ” 

The Irishman’s long body doubled 
forward, the muzzle looking him be¬ 
tween the eyes. He choked, and the 
fingers of his extended hands closed 
helplessly into the palms. 

Mariquita was in the room, but she 
seemed lost to what was passing be¬ 
tween the two men. Her concern was 
all for Bremerton. Kneeling, she took 
his head in her arms. Softly she pushed 
back the hair from his temples and 
kissed his brow, his cheek, his lips. 

“For me,” she whispered — “for 
me! Oh, I want you to live so I can 
repay you for this! I want you—” 

She paused, her broken voice trailing 
off into quiet. Softly from Bremer¬ 
ton’s gripping fingers she removed the 
revolver. 

“ Look! ” she said. “ There are no 
loads in it! ” 

O’Hara reached for the weapon, ex¬ 
amined it, and, with sneering con¬ 
tempt, exhibited it to Deane. 

“ He was bluffing you,” said he; 
“ and, like a friend, like an old partner, 
you called his bluff. Oh, if that can get 
under your skin, think of it now, carry 
it about in your head for years to come. 
But look for Mike O’Hara. You owe 
me something for this night's work, 
Deane, and it’s a debt you’ll pay! ” 

Deane backed away from the harm¬ 
less revolver as from a rattlesnake. He 
was staring at it as he reached the door; 
and he was still staring as he stepped 
backward into the night, the folded 
paper in one hand and the leveled re¬ 
volver in the other. 

Another moment and he was gone. 
He passed King in the doorway, and 
King whirled in a frenzy of consterna¬ 
tion and ran off toward the bunk-house. 

“ Deane has killed Bremerton! ” he 
shouted. 

His voice died out in the sullen hum 
of the mill. King, still shouting fren- 
ziedly, raced on to the sleeping day- 
shift with his news. 

O’Hara would have gone in pursuit 
of Deane had not Mariquita stopped 
him. 

“ It is not Deane but Bremerton who 
should have our attention now, Mr. 
O’Hara,” said she. “ Help me! ” 

The Irishman was like a man in a 
dream. He and the girl, between them, 
gathered Bremerton up in their arms 
and carried him to the bed in the other 
room. Then an oath burst from 
O’Hara and he ran out into the night. 

Half-clad men were rushing from 
the bunk-house. The mill clattered 
into silence, and Gorman led a wild 
group over the ore-platform and to¬ 
ward the office. 

“ Who did it ? ” shouted Gorman. 
“ Is it true ? ” 

“ True as gospel,” answered O’Hara. 
“ Deane shot Bremerton down. Find 
Deane—don’t let him be after getting 
away. He’s in this camp! ” 

But Deane was not in the camp. He 
had taken Mariquita’s horse, which 
was ready at his hand by the corral, 
and had fled. 

All the live-stock was pressed into 
service for the chase. O’Hara took 
one cayuse, and Red Collins another. 
Case went bareback on one of his 
horses, and King took the other. 
Dutch Fred’s team was likewise requi¬ 
sitioned. 

“ The doctor and the sheriff, we need 
them again,” called O’Hara as he gal¬ 
loped away. “ King, that’s your work! ” 

The little cyanid expert, for once in 
his life, felt equal to anything. He 
started on the long ride to town. 

For the rest of that night mining and 
milling were forgotten. The men clus¬ 
tered in groups around the headquar¬ 
ters adobe, talked while waiting for the 
searchers to return, and looked through 
the window at the prostrate, silent form 
on the bed. 

Mariquita was doing what she could. 
She was all womanly tenderness, and 


whenever her hands touched Bremer¬ 
ton it was like a caress. 

Giles, the one-eyed, tiptoed into the 
room. He carried his hat in his hand. 

“ D’ye think he’ll live, mum? ” 

“Oh, he will; he must!” the girl 
answered. “ Have you sent for a 
doctor ? ” 

“ King went, but it’s a long trip, 
and it will be sunup afore any one 
from town gits here. What can we 
do, mum ? ” 

“ I can do everything,” said Mari¬ 
quita. 

“And he’s goin’ to pull through?” 

“ Yes, yes! ” 

Giles tiptoed out again and spread 
the news. A faint, husky cheer came 
from the men. 

Bremerton had proved himself a 
man, and his hold upon the workers 
had strengthened even beyond his own 
knowledge. 

Slowly the dark hours slipped away, 
and Mariquita sat by the unconscious 
Bremerton, clasping his hand and wait¬ 
ing and hoping for the return of con¬ 
sciousness. One by one the searchers 
came back. Deane had eluded them. 

O’Hara resolutely took his place at 
Mariquita’s side. He was somber and 
grief-stricken for his friend and all 
consideration and kindliness toward 
the girl. 

“ Go home, Miss Mallory,” he 
begged. “ ’Tis too much for you. 
You’re like a ghost.” 

“ Don’t ask me to leave him,” she 
answered. “ I can’t.” 

O’Hara looked at her closely, and a 
flash of understanding broke over him. 
He smiled softly. 

“ If that’s the way of it,” said he, 
“ then sure you must stay.” 

They fought hard for hours to bring 
Bremerton back. Ragged streamers 
of dawn floated over the eastern hills 
before they succeeded. The first face 
Bremerton saw was Mariquita’s. His 
blank eyes slowly filled with realiza¬ 
tion. 

“ I did my best for you, novia,” he 
muttered. 
The girl’s eyes burned. Leaning 
down, she took one of his hands in 
both her own and held it to her white 
cheek. 

“ Novia! ” she whispered. “ Is it 
true, then?” 

He disengaged his hand and groped 
at the breast of his flannel shirt. He 
found there only a bandage. 

A troubled look came into his eyes. 

From her own bosom the girl took 
a glove, stained red at the fingers. 

“ Here,” went on Mariquita. “ I 
found it—I—” Her head went down 
on the pillow beside his. “ Novio 
mio,” she added in a stifled voice, 
“ what matters the mine or anything 
else, now that we know? ” 

He smiled up into O’Hara’s face. 

And then the throb of a motor-car 
awakened echoes in the silent camp. 

The car halted in front of the of¬ 
fice, and Ransom and Dr. Morton and 
—O’Hara could scarcely believe his 
eyes—Deane came into the room. 

“ What in the name of—” began the 
sheriff, then saw Mariquita and bit off 
his words. “ What’s been going on 
here? Who shot Bremerton? Deane 
brought us word, and we hit only the 
high places coming. What’s back of 
this black business?” 

“ Deane can tell you! ” cried 
O’Hara. “ Deane shot Bremerton! 
The nerve of him, to come back here 
like this! ” 

Deane was haggard and about spent. 
What he had passed through he alone 
knew. 

“It was an accident,” said Bremer¬ 
ton. 

“ Lee! ” protested O’Hara. 

“ It was an accident,” insisted 
Bremerton. 

Deane turned away and staggered 
out into the other room. 


CHAPTER XXVI. 

CONCLUSION. 

The. time came when Michael 
O’Hara, sitting under the oaks in the 


canon with his flute, paused in his 
playing to think of what had been and 
of what was to be. The old wander¬ 
lust was strong within him, and the 
beckoning hills would have had him 
long since but for Bremerton. He 
could not vanish before his friend was 
on his feet and the future way made 
straight for him. 

’Twas coming four weeks now since 
the “ accidental ” shooting. Deane 
had gone away immediately, but con¬ 
science had spoken to him that night. 
Why else had he gone for the sheriff 
and the doctor and come out with them 
to the mine? 

His heart was sore for his anger and 
his hastiness. He wanted to know that 
his old friend would live. He wanted 
to see with his own eyes that he had 
not opened the gates for a dauntless 
spirit. 

Well, he saw. Troth, and he heard 
Bremerton speak and insist on the 
words that cleared him. After that 
he went away and not once had he 
been heard from. 

Another superintendent—from Col¬ 
orado he was—came in a week. He 
had a smooth, boyish face, and his 
brown eyes turned often to Mariquita, 
who would not leave Bremerton’s 
side. But the girl thought only, lived 
only, for the man under her care; and 
the brown eyes were disappointed. 

It was easy sailing for the new su¬ 
per. The mill was grinding bonanza 
rock, and was closed down every other 
day for a partial clean-up. Men with 
guns stood guard by the plates, and 
people from Phoenix came to see that 
new wonder in the Phoenix Mountains 
—a mine whose performance outran 
expectations. 

It was no place for a sick man, what 
with the stream of visitors and the 
excitement. So in a week Bremerton 
was moved to Oak Flat in the canon. 
Mariquita would have it that way, and 
it was admitted that no one had a better 
right to dictate. 

Red Collins and Gorman had 
charge of the transfer, and their aids 
were Dutch Fred and Chase. O’Hara 
stood vigilantly by, and there were cer¬ 
tain safeguards insisted on by Mari- 
quita. 

A hammock was stretched between 
two saddle-horses and in it lay Bremer¬ 
ton. Without a jar he was carried over 
the trail and to the house among the 
oaks. The girl made it plain to O’Hara 
that he was to stay with his friend, and 
together they had been there nearly 
three weeks. 

Red Collins or Gorman or Giles— 
once it was King—rode over from the 
valley at frequent intervals to inquire 
about Bremerton and to leave news 
about the mine. 

The remarkable showing which the 
property was making brought Deane 
many offers. 

They eclipsed the half-million mark 
toward which they had striven at 
the first. There was no telling now 
what some one might pay for the Mari- 
quita. 

“ A fortune might have been yours, 
querida,” said Bremerton to the girl 
©nee when he was beginning to sit up. 

She leaned over the back of his 
chair, her soft arms encircling his neck 
and her happy eyes looking down into 
his face. 

* What is money, Lee,” she asked, 
“ to the other prize I have found? No 
one could buy it with all the gold in 
all the hills of this world! ” 

“ It’s not your prize,” he doggedly 
averred; “ but mine.” 

Out under the oaks, with his flute 
on his knees, O’Hara was wondering 
what Bremerton was to do. New re¬ 
sponsibilities were coming to him, and 
how were they to be shouldered? 

Then, along the canon trail, came 
horses and a buckboard with two men 
riding. 

The men turned in at the flat, and 
the rig halted near O’Hara. The 
Irishman got up with his faded, crook¬ 
ed eyes agleam. 

One man had descended from 
the buckboard and was coming toward 
him. It was Silas Deane. 


“ Don’t draw, O’Hara,” said 
Deane. 

“ Faith,” said the other, “ I’m not 
heeled. If I had something to 
draw—” 

“ You have something,” and 
Deane’s little eye twinkled. “ Draw 
on your imagination. What am I here 
for? ” 

“ Divil a bit,” said O’Hara, scowl¬ 
ing. “ Who can do any guessing about 
you ? ” 

From the open door of the house 
at that moment came Bremerton. 
Mariquita walked beside him, and his 
arm was over her strong young shoul¬ 
ders. They came toward O’Hara and 
Deane, and the mine owner watched 
Bremerton closely. 

An easy chair in the shade had 
been arranged, and Mariquita made 
Bremerton comfortable in it and then 
turned with hostile eyes to the visitor. 
Bremerton had looked at Deane with¬ 
out speaking. 

“ To what, Mr. Deane,” inquired 
the girl, “ do we owe this call ? ” 

“ I have a good bid for the mine, 
and I think we had better sell.” 

“ What have I to do with that? ” 

“ As much as I have. For nearly a 
month you have owned a half interest 
in the Mariquita Mine. The deed was 
recorded the day following the—the 
‘ accident.’ ” 

O’Hara was like a man in a daze. 

Mariquita was breathing quickly and 
her trembling hands sought the back of 
Bremerton’s chair. Bremerton merely 
studied Deane’s face. 

“ Bremerton made me see a light,” 
explained Deane. “ He showed me 
how to be square. I want his good¬ 
will, Miss Mallory, and I want yours 
and your father’s. I reckon I acted 
like a coyote. I have enough and to 
spare, and neither chick nor child to 
leave it to. The man in the buckboard 
is a notary. If you are ready to sign 
this deed I’ve brought along, to¬ 
morrow you and your father wijl have 
enough in bank to make the rest of 
your lives easy.” 

Bremerton struggled to his feet and 
put out his hand. His face was glow¬ 
ing with happiness. 

“ Silas, my old partner! ” he ex¬ 
claimed. “You have come back! I 
can hear the flood waters in Arapahoe 
Canon! This time, though, you have 
saved more than my life.” 

“How’s that?” queried Deane, 
gripping the hand. 

Bremerton turned to take Mariquita 
in his arms. 

“ Whisht! ” murmured O’Hara, ta¬ 
king Deane by the sleeve and drawing 
him away. “ Can’t you see how it is ? 
I knew it from the start. I’ll shake 
with, you, too, Silas Deane. Neither 
you nor I can be Lee’s best friend any 
more. The girl, God bless her, is near¬ 
est his heart. You’ve made their fu¬ 
ture safe and you ought to be happy.” 

O’Hara wiped his eyes. 

“Where’s that divilish flute?” he 
asked, looking around blindly.
