CAST AWAY AT THE POLE 


CHAPTER 1. 

A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. 

Our situation was not only hopeless, but de¬ 
moralizing as well. I realized this when I caught 
the professor looking at me with hard and hun¬ 
gry eyes. 

“What ails you, Prebble?” I asked, straight¬ 
ening out the sleeping bag with my numb fingers. 

“My body craves nutrition,” he answered 
huskily. “I must eat. Have you forgotten that 
we divided the last ounce of pemmican yester¬ 
day ? v 

“How could I forget it,” I replied, “with this 
dreadful gnawing at my stomach to serve as a 
constant reminder?” 

“Something must be done!” my companion de¬ 
clared, with convulsive energy. 

“But what?” I returned. “Here we are, lost 
on the ice cap, abandoned by our Eskimo guides.

sled gone, dogs gone, compass broken, and noth¬ 
ing to eat but our sealskin clothes. Something 
must be done, you say, and I agree with you 
fully. You joined this expedition to solve prob¬ 
lems. Solve this one/’ 

That should have floored Prebble. But it did 
not. 

“I have already solved this one—to my own 
satisfaction,” said he. 

And again that hard and hungry look was 
turned on me. 

“What are you thinking of?” I demanded an¬ 
grily. 

He gave a cackling, ill-timed laugh—a laugh 
that irritated me beyond words. 

“The old law of the survival of the fittest will 
apply here,” he said. “In your dash for the pole, 
captain, you have attained the farthest north, 
and I have demonstrated the truth of the me¬ 
teoric theory of the aurora borealis. If I go 
back I can tell what you have done; but you, if 
you returned to civilization without me, could 
no more tell of my discovery than discourse in 
Attic Greek. Ergo, I return.”

I knew what he meant, well enough. But I 
was no thready to serve as a diet for the pro¬ 
fessor, even at the command of science; and 
as for eking out -my own miserable existence 
with a ragout a la Prebble , I would as soon have 
thought of bolting the rule of three. 

“You’re crazy,” I said shiveringly. 

“Consistent, my dear fellow.” 

“See here,” I went on, “somewhere behind us 
is the ship and the ship’s crew. When the Eski¬ 
mo guides get back without us, searching parties 
will be sent out, and we’ll be found.” 

“But suppose the Eskimo guides don’t get 
back?” 

“I choose to think that they will,” I Responded 
firmly. “I’m not going to yield up my life to 
you and your meteoric theory of the aurora. 
That’s flat.” 

“Haven’t you a thought beyond your own self¬ 
ish aims and ambitions ?” Prebble returned indig¬ 
nantly. 

“Possibly I have,” I flung back at him tartly, 
“but I refuse to throw myself away on a little 
old professor with a bee in his bonnet.”

That was a shot that went home. The profes¬ 
sor sank into a morbid silence. 

“Besides/' I proceeded, “the farthest north 
doesn’t satisfy me. I shall attain the only point 
on this earth where the compass has but three 
cardinal points: east, west, and south/' 

“The North Pole!” he exclaimed. “Madman!” 

“I shall attain it,” I repeated,' a warm glow 
of enthusiasm pulsing through my hungry body. 
“I shall plant my country’s flag at the apex of 
the earth.” 

“What good will it do your country, or any 
other country?” he asked. 

“You talk strangely, professor,” I said frigidly. 

“How will the discovery of the North Pole 
benefit mankind, or advance civilization a single 
inch?'’ 

“Consider the luster of the achievement, sir.” 

“Luster of the achievement! Mirabile dietn!”. 

“Not only that,” I went on, waving my mit- 
tened hand in a direction I believed to be south, 
“but somewhere behind us is that execrable Grif- 
fyn, F. R. G. S.—an Englishman, sir, who has

sworn to beat me to the pole. Have you no 
pride, no patriotism ?” 

“I have both,” said Prebble plaintively. “But 
I am hungry.” 

“Hungry!” 

The insolence of this professor filled me with 
wrath unutterable. I towered above him and 
gave him a look that sent him crouching to his 
knees. He lifted his hands appealingly. 

“Your nose, sir,” said he, “is very white.” 

I left oflf glaring at him, picked up a handful 
of snow, and began rubbing my nose. By the 
time circulation was restored, I found the pro¬ 
fessor had crawled into the sleeping bag; so I 
crawled in beside him, thankful he had warmed 
it up. 

This particular bag was a three-man bag; that 
is, capable of holding three adults. It was shaped 
like an envelope, opening from end to end; was 
made of reindeer skin, and had an outer cover¬ 
ing of oil-tanned sealskin, the latter keeping out 
the water and keeping in the animal heat. 

I fastened the flap over the opening. Then 
Prebble bade me an Ironical “good night.” 



jo A Difference of Opinion* 

The professor’s “good night” may have been 
ironical because of one of two things: Either 
because of his resentment toward me, or because 
at that time of the year in the Arctics continual 
day reigned, and there was no night. 

“Which is the greater achievement, Prebble,” 

I asked, “finding the pole or demonstrating the 
truth of a meteoric theory ?” 

“There is no comparison. Captain Sails. Find¬ 
ing the North Pole is simply a matter of brute 
endurance; but demonstrating the truth of that 
theory, sir, involves ratiocination—calls forth all 
the best powers of the mind.” 5 

“Bah, sir!” I cried. 

“Bah to you!” he retorted. 

There and then I made a mental vow that the 
next time I went exploring in the Arctics I would 
use more care in selecting the scientific members 
of the expedition. Prebble had a string of let¬ 
ters after his name, abbreviating his honorable 
suffixes and extending his rights to sit with the 
highbrows, but he was about as sociable as a 
polar bear. 

He had said “good night” merely to open our

muffled conversation in the sleeping bag. Some¬ 
times he was like that—a human moving-picture 
film run through the lantern wrong end to. I 
had “bah’d” him in the hope of cutting short his 
garrulity. But the effort failed. 

“Suppose you find the pole,” said he, “how are 
you going to know when you get there?” 

“For a professor of your attainments,” I ob¬ 
served frigidly, “that remark is asinine.” 

He cackled jeeringly. 

“How are you going to make sure you’re aii 
the North Pole when you get there?” he repeated, 
with maddening insistence. 

“By observations!” I snapped. 

“Who’ll vouch for the accuracy of your obser¬ 
vations?” 

“You will. You haven’t any sympathy with 
my aims or aspirations, Prebble, but you’ll have 
to support me in a matter of truth and verity. 
If you don’t, your scientific reputation will suf¬ 
fer.” 

Once more he cackled. 

“I have been making mental notes, and draw¬ 
ing deductions,” he proceeded, “and, from my

A Difference of Opinion . 

studies of human activities in the frozen world, 
I venture a most remarkable but most scien¬ 
tific conclusion. Do you care to hear it?” 

“If you have discovered anything remarkable," 
I scored, “the event is sufficiently unique to com¬ 
mand my attention. Out with it, Prebble.” 

“Listen,” he returned, in his most didactic tone. 
“The basis of all observations that are to com¬ 
mand the respect and confidence of the learned 
public is embraced in the old statement of mens 
sana in cor pore sano —a sound mind in a sound 
body. In using your artificial horizon and work¬ 
ing out your position, you must approach the 
task with every faculty alert and unclouded.” 

“Certainly!” I agreed. 

“Salis,” he declared, “no human being can un¬ 
dergo the awful perils, and hardships of polar 
discovery without an overthrow of his mental 
poise.” 

“Bosh!" I cried. 

“Derision,” said he, “is the fool's -.answer to 
an argument, proving nothing, and leading no¬ 
where.” 



A Difference of Opinion . 13 

“Do you mean to say,” I demanded, “that I 
will not keep my reason?” 

“You have not kept it, my friend. Even now, 
with the pole still far away, the intense cold, the 
terrific physical strain, and the insufficient food 
have thrown you off your mental balance. You 
are not yourself, and you have not been yourself 
for several days. My discoveries along this line 
lead me to propound a theory of polar aberra¬ 
tion. The other day you called the white snow 
purple. That is a chromatic proof of failing 
reason,” 

Rage filled me, rage and indignation. 

“Prebble,” I cried, “you are the one who is 
losing his mind ! You-” 

“Another proof,” he continued calmly, “is your 
obstinate refusal to listen to my highly valuable 
suggestions. If your mind was unclouded, you 
would profit by my very excellent advice.” 

“If you had your senses,” I answered, “you 
wouldn’t think of turning cannibal merely to en¬ 
able you to get back to civilization and propound 
your meteoric theory of the aurora.”

“Desperate straits require desperate remedies,” 
he insisted. 

“If you were to propound such a^ desperate 
remedy back home, how long would it be before 
you were clapped into-a strait-jacket?” 

“Such a remedy would not be propounded back 
home; it would not be necessary.” 

“You're mad as a hatter!” I told him—and I 
iWas really beginning to think so. 

“When a mind fails,” said he, “it is a fact 
of record that it believes every other mind has 
failed. Salis, more and more you prove my con¬ 
tention.” 

“The fact of record,” I returned, “applies both 
ways. You think I'm crazy, and I know you are, 
I shall discover the pole, and I shall convince the 
learned public that I have discovered it. When 
I get out of this bag, and the ink in my fountain 
pen is thawed out so I can write with it, I'll 
put down the substance of your remarks in my 
diary.” 

“I hope so,” he answered. “And I hope you 
will put them down exactly as I make them. In 



A Difference of Opinion. 15 

your present deplorable condition, however, I 
presume that is asking too much.” 

Thereupon he rolled to one side of the bag, 
and I rolled to the other. There was a coldness 
between us. 

Strange how little things conspire to shape 
our destines here below. But for the space which 
mutual intolerance placed between the professor 
and myself in that three-man sleeping bag, one 
or both of us would have been sacrificed, and 
our sleep would have been a sleep of death. 

I remember reflecting bitterly on our hapless 
lot, and dozing off by degrees, the professor’s 
snores fading on my ears, and at last dying away 
utterly. How long I slept I have no means of 
knowing; but suddenly I was awakened by such 
a tremendous shock as I never expect to expe¬ 
rience again and live. 



CHAPTER II. 


HURLED INTO SPACE; 

The ends of the frozen bag were bent toward 
each other with a great crackling, so that instead 
of lying prostrate I was in a sitting position. I 
thrust one hand toward Prebble’s side of the bag* 
only to encounter a partition of deerskin. 

What had happened? The sleeping bag had 
suddenly acquired motion—not over the rough 
surface of the ice cap, but apparently through 
the air. 

I had a thought which chilled my blood. Had 
the bag slipped over a precipice at the edge of the 
ice cap ? And were we falling, falling- 

But, no, this could not be. There was no preci¬ 
pice at the edge of the ice cap, and the theory was 
untenable. 

Besides, if we had been falling, we would have 
struck something long since. 

“Have you noticed, captain, that we. have a 
concentric and a lateral, as well as a forward* 
motion?” 



Hurled into Space , 17 

“Prebble!” I exclaimed. “Are you alive?” 

“Keenly, sir. This is a most astounding phe¬ 
nomenon.” 

I now discovered that the partition of reindeer 
hide separating the professor from myself con¬ 
sisted of a fold of the sleeping bag pushed inward 
as by some hard substance. 

“What do you think is going 011?” I asked. 

“Our gyratory motion suggests a hurricane,” 
he answered. “It may be that we have been 
caught off the top of the ice cap by an arctic 
whirlwind. Can you open the flap, captain?” 

I could, and did, after some little trouble. The 
lengthwise slit was in front of us, and we were 
able to look through it without a change of po¬ 
sition. 

The view was not satisfactory, for a great 
white cloud enveloped us and made it impossible 
to see very far in any direction. We were sus¬ 
pended in gray space and moving with frightful 
rapidity. 

As we gazed out into the void, a black object 
came rushing from overhead, grazed the side of 
the sleeping bag, and vanished below. It was 



18 Hurled into Space* 

over in a flash; so quickly, in fact, that neither I 
nor my companion could determine what manner 
of thing the object was. 

“Merciful powers!" I gasped. 

“We are bounding upward/' mused Prebble; 
“upward as well.as onward." 

“Can you imagine what that thing was?" I 
queried. 

“Possibly a missile of meteoric origin. You 
are more athletic than I am, captain, and don't 
you think you could get an upward look without 
falling from the bag?" 

I craned my neck outside. The next instant 
an exclamation escaped my lips. 

“What do you see?" asked Prebble eagerly. 

“A rope!" 

“Suspended from what?" 

“I can't see. The object it hangs from is lost 
in the clouds. By the mizzentruck of the great 
Harry!" 

“What now?" 

I had made a discovery that almost caused my\ 
hair to stand on end.

“This sleeping bag is caught on the fluke of 
an anchor-” 

“I see, I see!” 

“The sleeping bag was scooped up bodily, the 
fluke catching it in the center. Your weight on 
one side and my’ weight on the other balances 
the bag.” 

“Beautiful, beautiful! Some aeronaut is mak¬ 
ing for the pole by balloon—his drag rope swept 
the ice cap—the anchor caught us. The object 
that darted downward a moment ago was a sand¬ 
bag, thrown from the balloon to offset our added 
,weight. Most remarkable!” 

Prebble was chuckling, rubbing his mittened 
hands together, and thoroughly enjoying the sit¬ 
uation. 

“Some scamp is trying to get ahead of Griffyn 
and me,” said I crossly. 

“Do you observe that the cold is abating V 9 
inquired my companion. 

“The sleeping bag does seem to be thawing 
out.” 

“Exactly! And I am in a profuse perspira¬ 
tion.” 



20 


Hurled into Space* 


Prebble divested himself of his‘mittens and 
parka. Then from somewhere about his person 
he produced his steel-rimmed spectacles and ad¬ 
justed them to his nose. 

“Ah!” he exclaimed, peering at me sharply. 
“It is a joy to use one’s glasses and hav-e them 
keep clear of the frost. Do you realize what 
a rising thermometer means, captain?” 

“It means warmer weather,” said I, divesting 
myself of a few of my furs. 

“Also that we are sailing southward at a.great 
rate.” 

I was startled, for I had not thought of the 
rising temperature in that way. . My hope of 
reaching the pole on that expedition was to be 
only a hope, and nothing more! 

The field was being left clear for my rival, Grif- 
fyn, the man who had followed me like a shadow 
ever since leaving the coast of Labrador. My 
bitterness of soul may be imagined, but not de¬ 
scribed. 

In the gloom of the moment I forgot my hun¬ 
ger, forgot that the professor and I were? bah 
aneed on the iron horn of a dilemma th^t might 



'Hurled into Space . 


21 


easily prove our undoing*—forgot everything, in 
fact, but that I had weathered that long arctic 
night, and borne innumerable hardships, all to 
no purpose. 

“We enter the domains of the improbable/’ 
came the remark of the professor, breaking in 
upon my unpleasant reflections. 

“Hard luck has a domain of its own/’ said I, 
glaring from my niche into Prebble’s, “and it’s 
so commonplace you can’t call it improbable.” 

“You do not grasp my meaning, captain,” my 
Companion proceeded. “If you were to give any 
one in the temperate zone a true account of this 
adventure your statements would be dismissed 
with a shrug—if with nothing worse.” 

“You would have to back up my statements, 
Prebble. Your scientific standing would bolster 
Up my integrity as a navigator, and-’ 

“I don’t know about that.” 

I fell back aghast. Picked oft the ice cap by a 
balloon, and carried southward on the fluke of 
an anchor, I had been meditating-an indictment 
against some reckless aeronaut. The terms of 



22 


Hurled info Space* 


that indictment were to set me right before those 
■who had helped finance my expedition. 

“What do you mean?” I rasped angrily. “I 
know you have no sympathy with my polar aims 
and ambitions, but you can’t deny the evidence 
of your senses.” 

“Captain,” he returned, “I am doubting the 
evidence of my senses. North of the arctic circle 
the human faculties become frozen and unreli¬ 
able. I do not credit our present experience—I 
do not dare.” 

“Poppycock!” I cried, in wrathful impatience. 

“We are under the spell of the purple snows,” 
he went on. “Pur adventures seem very real 
to us because our hardships have created illu¬ 
sions. All my life I have fought against being 
led astray by illusions—and under the Pole Star, 
lies the abode of things that seem, but are not.” 

“You’re mad as a hatter!” I stormed. 

“Not mad, Salis,” he protested mildly, “but 
temporarily unbalanced. You are in the same 
state of mind.” 

I saw him wriggle around in his half of the 
sleeping bag, punching and pinching himself* 



23 


Hurled into Space . 

Really it seemed he had an idea that he was 
asleep and dreaming these very momentous 
events. I saw him shake his head forebodingly 
upon being forced to the conclusion that he was 
.wide awake. 

“You're a scientific freak, Prebble," I jeered. 

“I am trying, in my feeble, way," he answered, 
“to combat error." 

“You are trying to give reason the lie. That’s 
what it amounts to." 

“When your brain is clear, captain, you will 
consider my actions differently." 

“We are being snatched southward at a pace 
which should soon carry us out of these regions 
of illusion," I observed. “Then, if we are still 
in this sleeping bag and balanced across the fluke 
of the anchor, I. suppose you will have to believe 
what you see?” 

He made no response, but I could see that my 
words had thrown him into a brown study. 

“And," I continued bitterly, “while we are 
bound for the prosy lands of reality and truth, 
my rival for polar honors is pressing forward 
into the white world of enchantment, where he 



24 


Hurled into Space . 


will probably discover what I have spent the 
better part of my life looking for.” 

“Don’t let that fact distress you, captain,” said 
Prebble. “Griffyn may think he has found the 
pole, and he may even get back to civilization to 
tell of it—but who will believe him?” 

These words, although I knew them to be far¬ 
fetched and far from dependable, gave me a thrill 
of delight. If my own statements and figures 
regarding the discovery of the pole were not to 
be offered in evidence, I took pleasure in seeing 
the report of my rival completely discredited. 
The sentiment was unworthy, I grant, but I was 
human, and had the customary human failings. 

“Anyhow, captain,” proceeded Prebble, “you 
have a contract with a newspaper, a contract 
with a magazine, and a contract with a lecture 
bureau. Out of these various contracts you will 
be able to amass a fortune, even if you don't 
find the pole. Griffyn, even though he is success¬ 
ful, will be discredited. You are an ex-officer 
of the army, and the army will be behind you. 
Griffyn is only a poor devil who took a chance 
on reaching the pole because he happened to 



Hurled into Space . 


25 


find the way open. Nobody will believe Griffyn. 
If you claim only the farthest north, everybody 
will believe you—in spite of the fact that you 
may not believe in yourself.” 

“This is foolish talk, Prebble,” I declared. “You 
ought to be above such random conversation.” 

In my mind, however, I was already planning 
my newspaper and magazine articles, and was 
figuring on the results of that lecture campaign. 
There was a possibility that I should receive the 
thanks of Congress and a medal! My heart began 
to thaw out, even as the frost was melting away 
from the sleeping bag. 

Our motion through space was easy and ex¬ 
hilarating. It was like flying through the skies 
on downy beds of ease. Swinging through the 
air and covering the miles with magical swiftness 
was vastly different from trekking, with dogs and 
sledges, over the broken floes, and making great 
detours to avoid open leads of water. 

We were going southward, and the result of 
my daring and my perils had been merely the 
attainment of the farthest north.- Although the 
fact was deplorable, it had its amenities. 



26 


Hurled into Space . 


I gave myself over to a long period o± contem¬ 
plation. In the course of my thoughts I found 
occasion to dwell at some length on the arrival 
of this mysterious balloon. Who was the aero¬ 
naut, and where had he come from ? Quite natu¬ 
rally, I could formulate no answers to these men¬ 
tal queries. 

Hours passed; then suddenly my companion 
reached over the partition and touched my shoul¬ 
der. 

“The cloud is vanishing/' he said. “Lean out 
and look upward, captain." 

I obeyed. High above us was the huge bulk 
of a balloon, and visible over the rim of the wick¬ 
erwork car, suspended beneath, were the faces 
of two men whom I knew only too well. 

I was speechless for a moment. Then a cry 
of rage escaped me. 

“Salis, by Jupiter!” boomed a voice from over¬ 
head. 

“Griffyn!” I shouted. 

What an irony of fate! My enemy and his 
secretary were the aeronauts, and it was their 
anchor that had jhooked into our sleeping bag - . 



27 


'Hurled into Space. 

Prebble clasped his bony hands convulsively. 

“I didn’t know that Griffyn had a balloon/’ 
he muttered hoarsely. “For Heaven’s sake, cap¬ 
tain, be amiable! Be-’’ 

“Silence!” I commanded. 

“You have taken an underhand advantage of 
me, Captain Salis,” my enemy called down. “You 
have attached yourself to my anchor, sirrah, 
with never so much as a 'by your leave.’ Your 
conduct is unprofessional, and I shall make it 
known to the members of the Arctic Club. If 
I had wanted to take you with me, I should have 
invited you.’’ 

Being a sailor, I had a supply of language for 
just such an emergency as this. Before I could 
release the torrent of words, however, Griffyn, 
F. R. G. S.—to his lasting infamy be it said— 
had reached his hand from the basket and had 
severed the drag rope with a keen knife. 

Down we dropped through the depths of space; 
down, down, the wind shrieking in our ears, and 
our brains reeling. Then a shock, a roar as 
of a hundred Niagaras, and after that—oblivion.. 



CHAPTER III. 


TERRA INCOGNITA. 

“Where are we?” 

That was my first question. It fell instinc¬ 
tively from my lips, and was addressed to no one 
in particular. 

I was a very much bewildered man. As I 
reclined on the ground and made use of my star¬ 
tled eyes, to my right I saw a pond, circular in 
form and perhaps fifty yards in diameter. 

This pond was edged with blocks of white 
stone. Knee-deep in the center of it stood a 
graven figure of colossal proportions, a jet of 
water spouting from its uplifted hands. 

Rosebushes in full bloom bordered the lake, 
and back of the rosebushes,' separated by a 
stretch of white sand, grew palm trees tossing 
their fronded tops in the balmy air. 

Birds sang in the depths of the grove, and a 
genial heat pervaded the atmosphere. 

I rubbed my forehead, water flying from, the 
sleeves of my soaked coat as I raised my hands. 



Terra Incognita. 2 g 

“Where are we?” I asked again, this time in 
a louder key. 

“Marvelous!” crooned a familiar voice behind 
me. “A is the balloon, b is ourselves, c is the lake, 
and x the way we got out; &‘divided from a goes 
into c -” 

I looked around, and there knelt that blessed old 
professor, wet as a rat, tracing algebraic symbols 
in the sand with his finger. 

“Professor,” I called, “avast with your foolish¬ 
ness, and try to make a guess as to where we 
are.” 

He looked up at me blankly. Water from his 
drenched garments had rilled around him in the 
sandy soil, and was running down his arm and 
off the index finger that was tracing the symbols. 

Still on his knees over the unsolved equation, 
he allowed his eyes to wander from me toward 
our surroundings. 

“A fountain,” he said. “Really a most ad¬ 
mirable work of art.” 

“And it spouts fresh water,” said I, freeing 
my lungs of a mouthful of it. 

“The lake,” he went on, running his gaze oven

the circular stone borders, “shows calculation 
and design carried out with engineering skill and 
a rare eye for beauty. " 

“Correct/' I agreed. 

“Roses in full bloom/' he proceeded. “The 
air is redolent of odors that are soothing and 
delightful." 

“Exactly," I returned. “We must have made 
a tremendous southing on the fluke of that 
anchor. Palm trees suggest the tropics." 

“Suggest?" he answered. “I grant you, but 
it is a suggestion we must adopt warily. The 
leagues upon leagues that lie between the arctic 
circle and the equator could not have been cov¬ 
ered by us on the fluke of the anchor." 

“I know that," said I, “and I wish you'd exer¬ 
cise your wits and make a guess at our present 
position. Pm bewildered." 

“One thing at a time, captain," he admonished, 
bending over his problem. “A is the balloon, b 
is ourselves-" 

“What has become of the balloon?" I cut in, 
searching the skies for some sign of the sky ( 
.wanderer. 



Terra Incognita . ^ 

Prebble frowned, and again looked up. But 
he did not rise. 

“When we were cut away, captain,” he ex¬ 
plained, “the immense weight suddenly released 
from the balloon caused it to mount to extraordi¬ 
nary heights. This warm air, too, would have 
its effect on the gas in the bag, expanding it and 
giving it tremendous buoyancy. Griffyn is sail¬ 
ing on.” 

“And southward,” I chuckled. “The scoundrel 
dropped us by the way, and I am glad we have 
parted company. In his rage, he is at least leav¬ 
ing us nearer the pole than he is himself.” 

The professor frowned thoughtfully. 

“Griffyn must have come from the north, cap¬ 
tain,” he observed. “In order to pick us off the 
ice cap and bear us south, Griffyn must have come 
out of the north.” 

The professor’s logic paralyzed me. 

“Do you think—is it possible-” My tongue 

clove to the roof of my mouth, and I could carry 
the distressing words no further. 

“Do I think,” finished the professor, “that he 
has discovered the pole, and that he was coming

away from it when the anchor picked us up? 
That is an open question, an open question. We 
need not concern ourselves about it.” Once more 
he began his finger-and-whole-arm movements 
over the sand. “A is the balloon, b is-” 

“But I do concern myself about it!” I shouted. 
“If Griffyn has found the pole I don’t believe I 
can ever get over it!” 

Prebble was annoyed by my interruptions, and 
jabbed his finger angrily into the symbol b. 

“Remember what I have already told you, 
Salis,” he flared. “Nobody will believe Griffyn ; 
found the pole, even if he claims the honor. He 
can’t prove it. His observations will be faulty. 
Anyhow, would it be possible to take observations 
from a balloon traveling as fast as that one? 
The airship was the sport of the winds. Is it 
possible that the winds carried Griffyn to the 
pole? Exercise reason, Salis.” 

“Then you admit that our reasoning is to be 
trusted?” I inquired. 

“Now—yes. We are in a tropical clime. The 
frozen ice fields have been left behind us. The 
result of our calculations cannot be nipped by

the Lost. If that were not the case, why should 
I be struggling to work out a problem that has 
to do with our rescue from the lake? Amuse 
yourself, Salis, and leave me to my labors.” 

‘Professor,” said I, “we are in a land that is 
inhabited by people well advanced in the arts and 
sciences. What we see proves it. Instead of 
wasting your energies trying to work out a tri¬ 
fling problem, would it not be better to stroll off 
somewhere and look for some one who can tell 
us what we want to know?” 

lie was still annoyed, still fretful. That equa¬ 
tion had obsessed him, and he was not to be 
drawn away from it. 

“One thing at a time,” he answered. “Let us 
meet our problems as they come to us. We are 
sure of the present, but we cannot predicate any¬ 
thing certain of the future. If you have business 
any place else, Salis, don't let me detain you a 
moment.” 

He waved his hand to command silence. In 
disgust, I turned from him and searched the dis¬ 
tance with wondering eyes. 

Fortune had been extremely kind to the pro- 



34 T err a Incognitdk 

fessor and me; there was no gainsaying that. Cut 
loose from the balloon by the murderous hand of 
GrifTyn, we had alighted> v safely from space. Ap¬ 
parently our lines had fallen in pleasant places. 

I say apparently, for presently something hap¬ 
pened which proved our position was not so se¬ 
cure as I had imagined. 

A sound reached my ears—a sound as of a 
stealthy movement. I whirled on the professor. 
He had not left his kneeling posture, but was 
gabbling to himself, and oblivious of everything 
but his foolish problem. 

And behind him- Good heavens! What 

I saw behind the professor, stealing upon him 
with deadly intent, was a figure such as I had 
never before encountered outside of a hideous 
nightmare. 

Seven feet the figure stood, if it-stood an inch. 
It walked upright, and bore a striking resem¬ 
blance to man, having two arms, two legs, a 
head, and features more or less human. 

But it was covered from top to toe with a fine^ 
reddish hair, the hair of the scalp long and flow¬ 
ing about the shoulders. Save for a bearskin 



35 


'Terra Incognita. 

twisted around its middle, the monster was en¬ 
tirely nude. 

How its eyes snapped and glowed in the furry 
recesses of its face! And as it stole toward the 
professor with catlike tread it raised a long spear 
with a shimmering point, poising the weapon. 

I tried to shout a warning, but my tongue clove 
to the roof of my moujh. I tried again, and this 
time I managed to gurgle incoherently. 

The professor peered in my direction. I flut¬ 
tered a hand toward the impending danger, and 
he turned around. 

“Ha!” he gasped. “The Missing Link!” 

Speech returned to me. With it came the 
thought that unless I put the professor’s peril 
into terms he could instantly comprehend, he was 
lost. 

“A is the Missing Link,” I cried, “b is the 
spear, and c is yourself. A divides itself from 
bj b goes into c, and x is what becomes of Preb- 
ble!” 

He gave a yell of horror, and fell flat. Chug! 
As he dropped, the spear flashed through the air 
above his head and buried its point in the sand. 



CHAPTER IV. 


DANGERS MANIFOLD. 

This danger had hurled itself upon us with 
paralyzing suddenness. I had succeeded in mas¬ 
tering my nerves, however, and was able to deal 
actively with the situation. 

In a twinkling, I sprang for the spear, jerked 
it from the ground, and balanced it in my hand 
as I faced the hairy demon. 

“Don’t kill him, captain—don’t!” cried Prebble 
excitedly. “Really, he’s a most remarkable speci¬ 
men, and we must take him back with us.” 

The Thing crouched in front of us, eyes burn¬ 
ing like twin coals, and muscles working with an 
itch to spring. 

“It’s a gigantic gorilla!” I declared. 

“Nonsense!” returned Prebble. “It’s as much 
above the gorilla as it is below man. It thinks 
we re pagan gods, and was simply bent on testing 
our invulnerability. Careful what you do, cap¬ 
tain ! It completes the Darwinian chain— —” 



1 'Dangers Manifold. 37 

“Darwinian fiddlesticks!” I cut in, out of pa- 
tience. 

Calm yourself, sir. Fortune favored us when 
we were cut loose from the balloon. We fell into 
that lake, and this creature must have pulled us 
out. If it had wanted to slay us, why didn't it 
do so while we were unconscious and entirely at 
its mercy? Observe, captain." 

Prebble got up and looked the hairy monster 
in the eye. 

“Hungry,” he said, making motions w I h his 
hands and jaws, as though eating, “famished.” 

“What kind of a pagan god do you imagine 
it will think you if it finds you are hungry?” I 
demanded. 

“That’s so,” said the professor. “\our lu¬ 
cubrations, captain, occasionally evolve something 
that is particularly apt.” 

Just then the monster roared aloud. The 
mighty sound went echoing through the grove, 
and was answered in kind from a dozen different 
points. 

“We are undone!" I groaned, as a whole pack 



38 Dangers Manifold. 

of the fiends appeared and raced toward us in 
full cry, from every quarter. 

I was not blind to the incongruity of the situa¬ 
tion. Although no judge of art, I knew full well 
that the colossus in the center of the lake was 
beyond the craft of these half-naked creatures, 
whose facial angles were small improvement on 
those of the orang-utan. 

Granted that these man brutes were subjects 
of a ruling race, where were the real lords of 
the country, or some one in authority, to whom 
we could make appeal ? 

Prebble and I were face to face with death 
in a most horrible form. The red demons were 
rushing upon us, snarling and yelping like so 
many bloodhounds, their spears leveled and ready 
to impale us. 

We could not take to trees, for the attacking 
force was between us and the grove. Nor could 
we retreat, for the lake lay behind us. 

Our doom was sealed. I felt it in every fiber, 
yet I would not shame the glorious traditions of" 
the American sailor by standing supinely and al¬ 
lowing myself to be speared. 



Dangers Manifold . 39 

The last ditch for me! Gripping the haft of 
my seven-foot lance, I held it at attention. 

Considering that the world was to lose an 
exhaustive paper on the meteoric theory of the 
aurora, and a thesis on the missing link, Preb- 
ble carried himself admirably. 

“Thirty seconds of life, captain,” said he. 
“They are getting ready to throw.” 

“Only one of them is to throw,” said I. “Look! 
That hulking imp with the rings in his ears is 
to have the first cast. See him rise on one foot 
—he throws himself back—he lets the spear 
fly-” 

I watched, every faculty whetted to abnormal 
keenness. The weapon darted toward us, its 
bright point cleaving the air like a jet of fire. 

I struck at it wildly. Fate was kind, and I 
countered the shaft, swerving it sideways, and 
sending it hissing into the waters of the lake. 

The fatal moment was postponed, that was all. 
Clenching my teeth, I waited for the next enemy, 
to step to the front and make a trial. 

“Captain,” quavered the professor, clutching 



40 Dangers Manifold l 

my arm convulsively, “I have this! I had for¬ 
gotten about it/’ 

A revolver! Prebble was holding it. out to 
me in his shaking hand. 

A shout escaped me. Flinging down the spear, 
I clutched the firearm, and before a second savage 
could launch a shaft I had fired. 

The effect of that shot was tremendous. The 
bullet did not find a mark—my nerves were not 
steady enough for accurate shooting—but the 
report was all-sufficient. 

Every one of the uncanny creatures fell face 
downward, and lay groveling on the earth. 

“Now, Prebble/’ I cried sharply, “run for your 
life! The woods—the woods!” 

We started, and had almost gained the shelter 
of the trees when a second detachment of the 
enemy appeared before us. I presented the re¬ 
volver, and pulled the trigger, but only an omh 
nous click followed. 

Again and again I tried, but without success 
—the cylinder was empty! 

'Too much aqua pura mixed with the ammu¬ 
nition/’ said the professor sagely. ‘ That bath 



Dangers' Mauifold . ^ 

in the lake must have disabled the firearm. It's 
a wonder, captain, that you were able to fire even 
a single shot. A very pretty problem suggests it¬ 
self, and I-” 

“Look!” I cried, interrupting his idle chatter 
in a frenzy. “They’re elevating their, spear 
points.^ We’ll be dead men in a dozen ticks of 
the watch unless we can do something to save 
ourselves.” 

“I am at the end of my resources,” declared 
the professor calmly. 

But I was not. An idea flashed over me, and 
I began putting it into execution without delay. 
With a hop, skip, and jump, I started a grotesque 
dance, hopping up and down, waving my arms, 
and grimacing as horribly as I knew how. 

The professor watched me in a sort of fascina¬ 
tion. I saw wonder in his face, and then dismay, 
and something very like anguish. 

But I also saw the lifted spears of the red 
rabble poise motionless in mid-air. That was 
the result for which I was working, and I re¬ 
doubled my exertions, 

“SaJis, Sali^!” screamed Prebble. “I was afraid 



42 Dangers Manifold . 

of this I I knew you were unbalanced. I knew 
your mind was trending toward this deplorable 
condition, but I had not expected such violence. 

'‘Get busy, Prebble!” I panted, pirouetting on 
my toes, and throwing off a small cascade of wa¬ 
ter as I whirled. 

“My poor friend!” wailed Prebble, clasping his 
hands, and striking an attitude of extreme de¬ 
jection. 

“Go to it!” I puffed, showing off a few buck- 
and-wing steps. “We're a pair of dancing der¬ 
vishes, Prebble! Reel it off, man—reel it off!” 

The spears still hung motionless in the air. I 
had the hairy monsters guessing, for my contor¬ 
tions were making a powerful appeal to their ab¬ 
original minds. 

The professor hurried toward mp and laid an 
imploring hand on my arm. 

“If we must die,- Captain Salis,” he begged, 

“let us go decently, and as becomes intelligent 
men.” 

“Don’t be an idiot!” I flung back. “Can’t you 
see that I’m doing this for a purpose ?” 



Dangers Manifold. 43 

“Purpose?” the professor answered. “What 
purpose can such crazy antics serve?” 

“We’d resemble a couple of pincushions by 
now, Prebble, if I hadn’t started this fandango.” 
The words were fairly jolted out of me as I tot¬ 
tered around, first on orle foot and then on the 
other. “I’ve seen this trick worked on the In¬ 
dians. All barbarians, particularly those who are 
low in the human scale, have a superstitious v#h- 
eration for persons who are crazy. The idea 
popped into my head, and I began to carry it out. 
You see what an effect it is having.” 

Our enemies had now dropped their spear 
points, and were gazing at us curiously. 

“They imagine,” remarked the professor, 
studying the savages with a good deal of inter¬ 
est, “that you are some sort of an evil deity.” 

“I don’t care what they imagine,” said I, “just 
so they keep their distance, and don’t use their 
spears.” 

“How long do you think you can keep that 
up?” 

“I don’t know,” I answered. “I’m hoping I 



44 


Dangers Manifold . 


can .keep it up until something, or other, happens 
to insure our safety indefinitely.” 

The professor was showing no disposition to 
join me in the dance. It was only when the 
savages executed a movement en masse toward 
the right, and lifted their spears for a throw at 
him, that he leaped into terpsichorean effort. He 
required no urging from me. He was quick to 
perceive the danger, and equally quick to resort 
to the only means for averting it. 

Round and round we whirled, exemplifying 
everything from a doublh shuffle to a sailor's 
hornpipe and a Highland fling. 

“This is monstrous!” wailed the professor; 
stepping high. “What a performance for a man 
of my professional standing! Salis, I have never 
felt more humiliated in my life.” 

“Keep it up!” I begged of him hoarsely. “When 
you give out, and have to drop, feign a fit. If 
you do it well it may save you.” 

At that moment, when the-spears were again 
lifted, the savages who had been routed- near the 
lake .by the report of the revolver, came warily 



Dangers Manifold. 45 

upon the scene. By a wide detour, they avoided 
us, and joined the ones who were threatening us. 

“There'll be something doing now," I gasped 
hoarsely. 

“The savages who just came will tell the others 
about the report of the revolver," said Prebble 
hopefully, “and that will so awe those who are 
hostile that we will be spared, and allowed to 
go in peace." 

But the professor was wrong. Instead of the 
late comers inspiring fear in their comrades by 
telling of the exploding firearm, the other side 
seemed to get the best of the argument. Both 
parties.presented a united front; what was worse, 
our exhibition of fancy dancing seeiped to have 
lost its charm. 

“The hostility," wheezed the professor, “seems 
to have become general." 

“All. hands are making ready to come at us," 
I whispered. 

“What’s to be done, Salis? Can we run?” 

“Useless. Spears would lay us low before we 
had taken a dozen leaps toward the sky line." 

“We might as well stop this foolish dancing 



46 Dangers Manifold . 

“Yes,” and we both staggered to a stop like 
tops that have all but run down. 

I faced the desperate situation with all the for¬ 
titude I could muster. 

“Die like a man, Prebble,” I gasped. “That’s 
all we can do now.” 

Another moment, and we should have fallen, 
pierced by half a dozen spears; but the unex¬ 
pected happened. 

Out from the shadows of the palm trees glided 
a form in white, halted between us and the threat¬ 
ening spear points, and raised one hand com- 
mandingly. 

Instantly every spear point dropped, and The 
form in white turned slowly and surveyed us. 



CHAPTER V. 

ASTONISHING DISCLOSURES. 

Our protector was a woman. Her delicate fea¬ 
tures, the shell-like tint of her cheeks, her 
long, sunny hair, her graceful form, all testified 
to that. 

She was clad in a clinging robe of white, edged 
with gold galloon; buskins of white and gold 
covered her small feet, and around her brows 
was a gold ribbon. She wore no head covering, 
and her wealth of yellow tresses flowed about her< 
like a veil, even to her waist. 

Never had I beheld such rare loveliness, and 
twenty years of sea had not blunted my apprecia¬ 
tion of the divine in woman. An exclamation 
of astonishment and admiration fell from mjj 
lips. 

Nor was the astonishment all on our pafrt. Sur¬ 
prise and wonder were mirrored in the woman’s) 
wide, blue eyes. 

Although thankful for her timely intervention,, 
I would have had my “meeting with her occur un-

uei happier auspices. A young man—I was but 
thirty-iive—should be particular how he comes 
under the eye of beauty, and my water-soaked 
clothes and disheveled appearance made my posh 
tion most embarrassing. 

Prebble did not seem to mind it. He was 
smirking and rubbing his hands and pushing 
himself forward in a way that irritated me. 

“Thank you kindly/' said he, bobbing his head 
and flashing his bald pate in her eyes. “Are you 
the owner of these beautiful grounds, madam ?” 

Our language was not hers. She stared at 
the professor blankly, and then shifted her gaze 
to me. 

She smiled. Small wonder she smiled, with 
my learned companion ogling and ducking and 
making a display of himself. 

“Hungry,” whimpered the professor, convey¬ 
ing imaginary things to his mouth and working 
his jaws, “famished.” 

He tuined to me with an unwonted luster.in 
his eyes. 

“We can’t deceive her‘into thinking we are

49 

P a S an g*° (ls >” he imparted. ‘This is paradise, 
captain, and she is one of the peri.” 

“Stop your tomfoolery!” said I petulantly. 
“ Y our spectacles are hanging from one of your 
ears, one of your mukluks is gone, and you look 
as though you had been through a cyclone. She’s 
laughing at you!” 

“At us! he tittered. “Both of your mukluks 
are gone, captain, and-” 

I did not hear the rest. Looking down, I dis¬ 
covered, to my horror, that my feet were bare,, 
and never before had they seemed so large or so 
out of place. 

I reddened to the roots of my hair. A sailor 
and a gentleman may be excused, I trust. 

She spoke to us, her voice like a flowing rill, 
rippling, musical. But her words! They were 
as much beyond us as ours were beyond her. 

When she ceased speaking there was silence. 
I looked, perhaps, what I could not say, for she 
vouchsafed another smile, turned to the hairy 
ones behind her, and addressed them imperiously. 

She vanished then, vanished whither she had 



5 ° 


Astonishing Disclosures* 


come. I gazed 'after her with eyes that spoke 
what my lips dared not utter if they could. 

The fiends stole up to us fawningly, making 
signs indicative of good will, as well as suggest¬ 
ing that we go with them. We heeded the mute 
request, and were led off through the grove in 
the direction taken by the lady, Our Lady of 
Hope and Deliverance. 

Behind us trooped the other detachment of 
Missing Links, equally harmless, and equally de¬ 
sirous of showing the amicable turn their feelings 
had taken. 

“Where are we, professor?” I asked, for the 
third time. 

“We have fallen,” said he, “upon some un¬ 
charted isle in the tropics. You are Tele- 
machus, I am Mentor, the maid is Circe. Be¬ 
ware, captain!” 

“Folly!” I'retorted. “Do you mean to say 
that we were carried on the anchor of Griffyn’s 
balloon from above the arctic circle to below the 
Tropic of Cancer?” 

“How else do you account for the flowers, the 
palms, the balmy atmosphere? We are cast- 



Astonishing Disclosures . 


Si 

aways, captain; and our lines, it seems, have 
fallen in pleasant places.” 

I marveled. Yet how else could we explain 
the surroundings in which we found ourselves? 

Presently we came upon a vista which seemed 
cut bodily from the “Thousand and One Nights.” 

A palace arose before us; a palace with domes 
and towers of purest white, outlined against the 
blue sky. 

A great flight of marble steps led upward to 
the fagade of the building. On either side of 
the first sfep stood two stalwart warriors on 
guard. 

“Such a magnificent building!” murmured 
Prebble. “There must be something to eat inside 
of it, captain.” 

“That is my hope,” said I, “and the quicker 
we fall to, the better. I am growing weak in 
the knees.” 

At the foot of the grand stairway, a man ap¬ 
peared as if by magic. Evidently he had been 
informed of our coming, and was expecting us. 

He was of normal height, and wore a white 
tunic, edged with silver. His head was un- 



52 


Astouishin g D is closures* 


covered, and his forehead and short, yellow hair 
were spanned with a silver ribbon. 

His face was high-browed and almost of Gre¬ 
cian contour. His eyes were blue, as were those 
of the young woman, and as they rested on me 
a peculiar sensation sped along every nerve. 

Mentality was the keynote of the man’s eyes. 
(The powers of his mind were extraordinary, and 
were reflected in his glance in a manner most 
strange and incomprehensible. 

Not being verged in psychology, J could not 
explain this visual force. I merely realized that 
the eyes of this startling individual usurped the 
office of lips and tongue, speaking a language 
and compelling obedience. 

Without a spoken word, the man turned on 
the hairy creatures who had conducted us to the 
palace. They quailed under his look, shivered, 
and slunk 'away. 

Then he flashed an order to us. The next mo¬ 
ment he was ascending the steps, Prebble and I 
at his heels. 

Whether it was the hypnotism of the man’s 
eyes, or a weakness caused bv hunger, vet my 



Astonishing Disclosures . ^^ 

brain grew dizzy, I staggered rather than walked, 
and had but faint recollection of events for some 

time. 

We were in a large room, it seemed, and more 
of the uncouth slaves were at work over us. In 
due course we left this room, and came out into 
another, where there were strange plants and 
blossoms, and couches covered with finest skins. 

We reclined. Slaves hovered about us, giving 
us food out of silver dishes. 

What we ate I do not know; but the food, 
whatever it was, was piquant and delicious. 

With hunger finally appeased, 1 felt in a mood 
fof sleep; but the professor was garrulous, 

“Certainly,” he sighed, with blissful content, 
settling himself luxuriously upon his couch, “this 
is paradise, this is the abode of the blest. I, tor 
one, am very much obliged to Griffyn for cutting 
us clear oi his balloon.” 

“He will answer for that!” I scowled, allow¬ 
ing a spasm of righteous wrath to cross my 
contentment. 

“Will he so, my dear captain ?” chuckled Pr.cb- 
ble. “Where, and when, if I may ask?” 



S4 


Asto n ishin g D is cl osures.. 


“Where?” I snapped. “Why, where else can 
I pillory him save in his own country, which his 
unprofessional conduct has disgraced ? And when, 
you ask. As to that, Prebble, I promise you it 
shall happen directly we return to civilization.” 

“Return to civilization! We have already.re¬ 
turned to civilization, captain. Ever since we 
dropped from the balloon we have seen, all around 
us, evidences of a most civilized and progressive 
people.” 

“You quibble,” said I, with strong disapproval. 
“It does not fit your character, professor. You 
understand what I mean. We have here a very 
high grade of civilization, it seems; but what I 
had in mind was a return to our own country.” 

“And when will that be?” he asked. 

“I’m in the dark as to that. I presume, how¬ 
ever, that we have only to describe our situation 
to the people in authority here in order to be 
assisted to a home port.” 

He cackled. There was something in that 
laugh of his which always ruffled my nerves the 
wrong way. 



Astonishing Disclosures. 55 

“What is there humorous about that?” I de¬ 
manded. 

“I fancy,” he replied, “that you are building 
your hopes on a very insecure foundation. The 
rulers of this most delightful land may have other 
plans for us. They may not lend us their assist- 
ance as you so fondly imagine.” 

“Certainly,” I returned, “they must have com¬ 
passion upon us! People so artistic and so pro¬ 
gressive must have hearts to be touched by our 
forlorn situation.” 

“They are a rich people, and a rich and cultured 
people are always generous. They may not be 
able to help us, however.” 

“Why not?” 

Prebble loved disputation for its own sake. He 
was not always to be taken seriously when he 
grew argumentative. 

“I am fairly well acquainted with the charted 
portions of the Seven Seas,” he went on, “and I 
have read extensively along the lines of anthro¬ 
pology and kindred sciences, but I find it impossi¬ 
ble to identify those hairy monsters who came 
so near proving our undoing, or these white- 



56 Astonishing Disclosures . 

robed demigods who came to our rescue. Nor 
have I the least idea what country this is, or 
where it can be situated. If visited be¬ 
fore, it certainly must have been written 
about. There is nothing in literature, how ever, 
that touches upon this favored country. Of that 
I am positive.” 

‘‘Do you incline to the belief that we made 
an abnormal southing while on the anchor of 
that balloon? You doubted it when I mentioned 
the matter by the lake; and then, on our way to 
this palace, you seemed to Swerve and incline to 
my original opinion. But my own ideas had 
undergone a change.” 

“It was physically impossible for us to be car¬ 
ried so far south,” said he, after a little reflec¬ 
tion. “We are in a tropic land.” 

“A tropic land under the arctic circle!” 

“A paradox, I grant you. Yet we must be¬ 
lieve the evidence of our senses and predicate 
equatorial regions here, or else we must doubt 
the evidence altogether, and fall back upon the 
assumption that we are non compos^ and. are not 



Astonish ing Disclosures. 


57 


to place any credence in what we see, or feel, or 
hear.' 5 

“Bali!” said I. 

“I rather incline to the theory,” he proceeded, 
unmoved by my disgusted retort, “that we are 
under the spell of the purple snows. It is very 
possible that we are still on the ice cap, in the 
sleeping bag, far gone with hunger, and freezing 
slowly. Our minds are benumbed, save for a 
few of its faculties, which appear to be abnor¬ 
mally alert.” 

This astounding theory quite took my breath. 

‘Nonsense!” I exclaimed, as soon as I was 
able to express myself. “Suppose you had been 
impaled by that spear down by the lake? That 
was not an imaginative spear, Prebble, and you 
would not have died an imaginative death.” 

“To drop into the vernacular,” he smiled, “my 
frozen finish would merely have ( been symbolized 
by that spear. What we are apparently under¬ 
going, it seems to me, is merely symbolical, and 
is —” 

“You think we’re asleep?” 

“If we are, it would be difficult to awake in 



58 Astonishing Disclosures . 

a pleasanter paradise than this. For one, captain, 
I am not particular whether we ever leave this 
abode of bliss or not.” 

“How about your meteoric theory of the 
aurora?” 

“It will be a distinct loss to science if that is 
never enunciated,” he answered, with a dash of 
disappointment. “But”—and he brightened—“if 
you fail to qualify with your newspapers, and 
magazines, and the lecture platform, I believe I 
should be able to bear with my own disappoint^ 
ments.” 

“My principal reason for returning to my own 
country just now,” said I firmly, “is to enlighten 
the Arctic Club and the world regarding Grif- 
ifyn.” 

“Forget Griffyn, captain! His own safety 
seemed to demand that he cut us adrift. I am 
thankful that he released us from his balloon, 
'for otherwise we should not haye visited this most 
interesting country.” 

I had a sufficiency of his views, however, and 
iwhile he talked on I went to sleep. 

I was awakened by a touch on the shoulder. 



Astonishing Disclosures . 

Starting up from the couch, I encountered the 

eyes of the man who had met us at the palace 
steps. 

The eyes bade me get up. I obeyed, and caught 
a glimpse of the professor, in a tunic of white 
and silver, with a silver ribbon snugly encircling 
his bald spot. 

At this I laughed immoderately, but ceased 
when the face of our unknown friend turned on 
me in rebuke. The face was grave, ominous, 
and I r.ead disaster in its every line. 

Commanded by a look, Prebble and I trailed 
after our guide to an archway hung with arras 
in cloth of gold. The curtains were parted by 
invisible hands, and we passed through into an 
immense apartment, our eyes dazzled with a 
scene of-gorgeousness I shall never forget. 

Yellow and white and blood red were the pre¬ 
vailing colors of vaulted roof, lofty walls, and 
tessellated floor. The gleam of gold was above 
us, the sheen of silver on all sides, and our bus- 
kined feet trod tiles of jasper. 

In front of us, at the farther end of the vast 
room, was a throne, with a crimson canopy. Un-; 



6o 


Astonishing Disclosures . 

der the canopy sat a man clad in the prevailing 
white and silver, and wearing a crown that 
flashed with jewels. 

On the topmost step of the short flight leading 
to the dais sat a regal figure in white and gold. 
I rubbed my bewildered eyes, for, unless they 
deceived me, this was she who had saved us at 
the lake. 

The room was thronged with people in white 
and silver and white and gold, and a V-shaped 
lane had been opened for us up to the very steps 
of the throne. Rays of sun, entering through 
windows in the eastern wall, struck the tiles and 
threw wondrous patches of scarlet over the white- 
clad groups. 



CHAPTER VI. 

FURTHER PERILS. 

Amid all this bewildering scene, the mind of 
Prcbble was analytically at work. 1 could hear 
him mutter: 

“The women wear the gold and the men wear 
the silver. How does it come that an island so 
rich, with inhabitants of such intellectual power, 
has never been heard of by the outside world?/ 
Captain!” 

“Well?’* I breathed softly. 

“They still think we’re pagan deities. We have 
been robed in the costume of the country, and 
you, with your black hair and dark eyes, look 
well enough, although a trifle out of place. Don’t 
stand there like a dazed imbecile! Throw dignity, 
into your bearing. Watch me!” 

He adjusted his spectacles, folded his arms 
across his narrow chest, and peered about him 
with lofty disdain. But he was not of a size to 
foster an impression of haughtiness. 

As we stood there, cynosures for all eyes, two 



62 


Further Perils « 


of the red warriors stole past us with velvet tread. 
Between them they carried our old sleeping, bag, 
and laid it on the floor before the throne. 

The man who had taken us in hand advanced, 
kowtowed to his ruler, and began to talk, They 
were queer-sounding words that came from his 
lips, and that they had all to do with us was 
evident from the astounded looks that continued 
ito be turned in our direction. 

When he'had made an end, he salaamed and 
stepped back. Thereupon the young woman spoke 
to the king from her seat on the step. 

Her remarks finished, the king himself in¬ 
dulged in a few words, and the man who had 
brought us to the throne room gave his attention 
to the sleeping bag. Our clothes were inside the 
bag, and were brought out and duly exhibited. ^ 

There was something else which our friend 
wanted, and he got it by burying himself to the 
heels m the bag. As I live, it was a quart flask’ 
Of whisky! 

“Look here, Prebble,” I growled in his ear, 
did you have that flask all the while we were lost 
On the ice cap?”

I was saving it for emergencies, captain/’ 
he mumbled. 

“And you never said anything about it!” I ex¬ 
claimed fiercely. 

I tell you I was saving it for emergencies!” 

I was strongly tempted to la}' hands on freb- 
ble, but just then hands were laid on both of us, 
and we were hurried up nearer the throne. 

The king rapped his scepter against the arm 
of the throne chair. A little man appeared; a 
little man with luminous eyes, and the nose and 
chin of a Punchinello. 

In his hands he carried two metal circlets, each 
crossed with a pair of thin metal bands bent into 
concave form. ~He seemed to understand what 
was wanted of him, for, after saluting the king, 
he came to Prebble and me and placed the con¬ 
trivances upon our heads. They fitted the skull 
like a cap. 

I trust that so far it has not been necessary 
for an officer and a gentleman to dwell upon his 
veracity. That I advert to it here is simply be¬ 
cause I have reached a point where the reader’s 
credulity may receive its first shock 



64 


Further Perils. 


Other shocks will follow, and I wish to lighten 
the blows by a manly and straightforward state¬ 
ment. 

Prebble and I had dropped in on a truly won¬ 
derful people. The skill they showed, the arts 
they applied, the highly developed mental proc¬ 
esses that were theirs, were the natural con¬ 
comitants of a civilization marked at every turn 
by ways and means to us oftentimes inexplicable. 

I am writing these experiences with painstak¬ 
ing care, and if the reader will abide with me to 
the end, I promise that he shall not, only be in¬ 
structed and thrilled, but convinced as well. Now, 
then, for the first shock. 

The instant those metal caps were placed upon 
our heads, Prebble and I were put en rapport with 
these amazing beings. We could not only under¬ 
stand their speech, but our tongues were endowed 
with it! 

“Strangers, whence come you?” demanded the 
king. 

Prebble clapped his hands like a delighted 
schoolboy, pulled off his metal cap, looked at it

gloatingly, fondled it, and then replaced it upon 
his_shining pate. 

“From a far country, sir/’ he answered. 
“What brought you hither?” 

“Chance.” 

“And a drag rope/’ I added mentally. 

“Are you from beyond the ice wall?” 

Prebble blinked in bewilderment. 

“I do not understand, your majesty,” said he. 
For once I happened to be a little quicker of 
comprehension. 

“What is the latitude of this country, sir?” I 
ask^d eagerly. 

The king nodded toward the little man with 

the hooked nose and chin. 

“Eighty-nine degrees and forty minutes 1101th, 

said the little man. 

“Twenty minutes,” I gasped, reeling against 
Prebble. “Twenty minutes from the pole ” 

“How— what— why-” faltered Prebble. 

••The open sea-the icc- What does this all 

mean? 1 ' , 

“Only twenty-three miles from the goal of 
my hopes!" I shouted. “Only twente-three miles

from fame, from the greatest discovery the world 
has ever known! Glory!” I danced around like 
a wild man. “Twenty-three miles!” I roared. 
“Twenty-three miles!” 

I started at a run for the doorway, anxious 
to leave the palace and race on foot over the 
twenty-three miles that separated me from the 
spot it was m/consuming desire to reach. 

Prebble grabbed me, but I kept on, jerking 
him heels over head. The two hairy warriors 
then placed themselves in my way, and I fought 
like a fiend to escape. 

There was the greatest disorder in the vast 
room. The king was on his feet, and the court 
was in a tumult. I was fighting fiercely, my 
senses dazzled by my proximity to the pole. Had 
I used my reason, I might have questioned the 
reliable nature of the knowledge just given me; 
for how could I be in a tropical region and yet 
only twenty-three miles from the goal of my am¬ 
bition? But I was* in no condition just then to 
reason about anything. I was wild with excite¬ 
ment. 

Food and rest had revived my failing strength. 



Further Perils . 


6 7 


A straight cut blow from the shoulder dazed one 
of the hairy guards; it only dazed him, however. 
Had he been endowed with ordinary physical 
powers, it would have floored him. 

The fellow came back at me, hissing like a 
wild cat. I saw his ponderous hand clench for 
a retaliating blow and his gigantic arm draw 
back. A shout from the king caused the second 
of the two guards to seize his companion’s arm 
before he could strike. This diversion seemed 
to leave the path clear for me, and I turned to 
continue my mad flight. A foot tripped me, and 
I measured my length on the jasper tiles. Be¬ 
fore I could rise, two bare knees were on my 
chest, pinning me down, and two hands were at 
my wrists, holding me powerless. 

Prebble, white and apprehensive, drew close. 

“Captain,” said he, “you are beside yourself. 
What folly! Man, man, don’t you know it is 
impossible to escape from this palace, guarded 
as it is? Even if you did manage to get outside, 
in traversing the twenty-three miles said to lie 
between you and the pole, there wculd be ample 



68

opportunity to lay you by the heels. The whole 
country would be up in arms against you.” 

I ceased struggling. 

“That is quite true, professor/' I answered. 
“My enthusiasm ran away with me/' 

“Your enthusiasm came very near costing you 
your life.” 

“But the pole-” 

“There is some wild guessing on the part of 
the gentleman with the hooked nose. Reason 
tells us that the polar regions are choked with 
ice. There could be no summer weather such a 
short distance from the North Pole. Either that, 
captain, or we are in a realm of enchantment.” 

“I don't believe in enchantments,” I scoffed. 
“But enough of this. Get off me,” said I to the 
giant on my chest, “and I'll be tractable.” 

The guard did not seem to comprehend. Preb- 
ble picked up the helmet, which I had dropped 
from my brows, and replaced it. 

“Now tell him,” said he. “By the aid of that 
marvelous ring he’ll be able to understand you.” 

Some of the nobles had advanced by that time, 
and the hostile flash of their blue, compelling eyes

69 

forced the warrior to arise and allow me to regain 
a more dignified attitude. 

I arranged my disordered tunic. The sullen 
guards placed themselves one on each side of me, 
and one of the nobles stepped close and spoke 
sharply. 

This, said he, “is most unseemly conduct for 
the throne room.” 

“I was carried away by the know ledge that was 
imparted to me,” I returned humbly. “I am very 
sorry I caused any trouble.” 

“He is very impulsive,” put in Prebble, “alto¬ 
gether too much so at times for his own good. 
But at least, I assure you, barring a few little 
conceits and crochets, he is a very agreeable fel¬ 
low.” 

“His majesty deals very severely with any in¬ 
fraction of court etiquette,” went on the noble 
“Unless you promise to be more circumspect in 
your behavior it will be necessary to put you in 
restraint.” 

“Don’t do that, your lordship,” spoke up Preb¬ 
ble, in considerable agitation. “The captain .means 
well, I assure you, although now and then he has 



70 


Further Perils . 


a poor way of showing it. I will stand sponsor 
for him.” 

The flinty bine eyes of the noble withered the 
professor for a space. 

“And who will be responsible for yon?’’ he 
asked. 

Prebble was usually sufficient unto himself, 
and it was humorous to see him squirm and 
shrivel under the flash of the noble^s blue orbs. 

“In my own country,” answered the professor, 
attempting a little dignity, but with scant success, 
“my word is as good as my bond.” 

Prebble was measured with a swift glance, 
and the noble turned away with a shadow of a 
smile. 

“Is he laughing at me?” the professor whis¬ 
pered in my ear, “What does he mean by that?” 

“Your ring’s crooked,” said I, completely re¬ 
stored to my normal condition of mind, “and it 
doesn’t enhance the dignity of your appearance. 
Better straighten it, Prebble.” 

“I’m afraid this outburst of yours, captain," 
remarked Prebble, as he straightened the ring,

“will inspire the king to harsh measures against 

US.” 

I don t think much of him as a king 1 if he 
allows his judgment to be swayed by a little natu¬ 
ral exuberance on my part.” 

“You should have repressed yourself. The fel¬ 
low in the skin robe is still blinking from the ef¬ 
fects of that blow you dealt him.” 

“But for a remarkably thick skull,” I returned, 
“he’d not now be able even to blink.” 

The disorder had died away, and a measure 
of courtly quiet once more prevailed. The king 
Ijad seated himself, and our guards, obeying an 
imperial gesture, returned Prebble and me to the 
foot of the throne. 

“For ages,” said his majesty, “our mythology 
has taught us to look for two fiends who were 
to drop from the sky and bring woe and ruin 
to my devoted kingdom. Are you those arch 
fiends? Answer!” 

By this time I had recovered my wits. 

“No, sir,” I replied, “we are not the fiends 
you are expecting. They are coming through 
the air on a strange ship, and seem to be a little

behind schedule, but I assure you they will arrive, 
all right.” 

Prebble whirled on me, caught one of my 
hands, and shook it heartily. 

“Neatly done, captain!” he whispered. 

“I must beat Griffyn to the pole,” I returned 
excitedly. “If he comes down anywhere this side 
of latitude ninety, I think that will block him.” 

“We will be on the lookout* for the fiends you 
mention,” pursued his majesty. “Meanwhile, as 
there seems to be no little mystery surrounding 
you two gentlemen, I shall be under the painful 
necessity of having you put to death!” 

“Sire!” cried the young woman, looking up 
at the king and holding out her hands appeal¬ 
ingly. 

We started to enter a vigorous protest, but the 
king waved his hand impatiently. 

“Princess Ylma, enough!” said he to the young 
woman sternly. 

To us he added: “I am deaf to your entreaties 
You have come as tradition says the demons were 
to come, you act strangely/ and an ounce of pre-

73 

vention, in this particular case, is worth a pound 
of cure.” 

The professor and I gazed at each other in 
wildest horror. For a space, Prebble Appeared 
to shrivel up; then suddenly he expanded, a for¬ 
lorn hope flickering across his pallid face. 

Springing to the heap of garments lying on 
the sleeping bag, he picked up the flask, and car¬ 
ried it to the edge of the dais. 

“We are very great prophets in our own land, 
O king,” he averred glibly. “Behold the proof 
of our skill !” and he waved the bottle aloft. 

“What is it?” asked the king. 

“The Elixir of Life, sire! Drink, and you will 
renew your youth.” 

Eagerly the king grasped at the flask. Unwit¬ 
tingly Prebble had touched a button that con¬ 
nected with his majesty's dearest desire. 

“Beware, your majesty!” cried voices. “It may 
be poison!” 

Already the king had unscrewed the top. After 
hesitating a moment he smiled craftily. 

“Drink!” said he, handing the flask to the pro¬ 
fessor. “If it kills you. I will let it alone.” 



74 


Further Perils. 


Prebble took a swallow from the flask. Then 
I grabbed it away from him and took another. 

This satisfied the king. Taking the flask from 
my hands, he raised it to his lips and drank deeply. 

He was lost! As the fiery liquor went down, 
an electric thrill sent the hot blood racing through 
his veins, and he felt that the beginning of his 
rejuvenation was at hand. 

“These are not the fiends who were to bring 
destruction to my kingdom!” he cried. “These 
are my good friends! Lord Nylis, they are in 
your charge—their safety be upon your head. 

“Lodge them royally, give them the best of 
everything. Gadzooks, but I v feel a different man 
already! Away with them, Lord Nylis! And as 
for the rest of you, depart from the presence. I 
would fain be alone with my elixir.” 

Again was there confusion. During the hub¬ 
bub, Prebble and I were conducted from the 
throne room and from the palace by Lord Nylis. 

The flask of bourbon had saved us, for the 
time being, But at what a cost of danger to 
ourselves and vicissitudes to that devoted king¬ 
dom! 



CHAPTER VII. 


COLD FACTS ABOUT A WARM COUNTRY. 

“Eighty-nine forty, eighty-nine forty,” I kept 
repeating to myself, as the professor and I fol¬ 
lowed Lord Nylis down the grand stairway of 
the palace. 

I could think of nothing but that the culmina¬ 
tion of my earthly desires lay only twenty-three 
miles away. 

This Lord Nylis was the astute person who 
had engineered our entrance into the palace. At 
the foot of the marble steps he paused and looked 
toward the red warrior on the right. 

Instantly the warrior's spear rang thrice 
against his shield. 

“That calls my oyd car,” explained his lord- 
ship. “We are some distance from my palace, 
and must ride.” 

The metallic crash of spear on shield had 
brought me to myself. At his lordship s mention 
of a" conveyance, an idea flashed through my 

mind. 



j6 Cold Facts About a H arm Country . 

“Could we not ride to the pole?” I asked ea¬ 
gerly. “It is not far, Lord Nylis, and I particu¬ 
larly desire to reach the pole,” 

He shook his head. 

“It would be as much as our lives are worth,” 
he answered. 

A cold chill struck to my heart, 

“What do you mean?” I faltered, 

“The pole is in the land of the Churs,” he went 
on. “They are brutes like these,” he indicated 
the guards to right and left of the palace steps, 
“but they are not under our domination. Some 
of the Churs we have brought to submission - by 
will power alone, and they are everywhere 
throughout the kingdom, serving as soldiers, and 
menials. 

“The Churs at the pole, however, are wild and 
ferocious. We never encroach upon their terri¬ 
tory unless in quest of slaves,. Ah, here is the 
oyd car. Mount, gentlemen!” 

The vehicle now drawn up before us was a 
queer bit of mechanism. The bed of it was dia¬ 
mond-shaped, and had a : large, wheel: at each 



Cold Facts About a IVarm Country. 77 

side and smaller ones at the points, front and 
rear. 

Across the middle was thrown a very wide seat, 
and there was another narrow one, occupied by 
a shaggy Chur, in the front point. 

“Home, Klimon,” said Lord Nvhs. 

Klimon bent over a square box, and slightly 
raised a sliding cover, at the same time manipu¬ 
lating a lever on his left. At once we glided 
away, smoothly and noiselessly. 

The vehicle ran point foremost. But what 
furnished the motive power ? The professor was 
first with a question on this head. 

“What is the power that drives this vehicle, 
your lordship?’' 

“We call it oyd,” answered the noble. “It 
drives all the machinery in the kingdom.” 

“Oyd,” muttered the professor. “I know about 
everything worth knowing, but somehow that has 
escaped me. Will you explain. 

“The force is magnetic,” was the answer. 
“There is a mineral which we delve from deep 
in the ground and call zellin. The whirling of 
(the earth creates a friction which makes of the 



Cold Facts About a Warm Country . 


78 

North Pole a tremendously powerful loadstone* 
so that it attracts every particle of zellin on the 
surface of the kingdom—and it attracts only zel¬ 
lin, and nothing else.” 

“I see,” said the professor sagely. “You have 
a piece of zellin in that box on the forward point 
of the carriage.” 

“Yes. That box is a nonmagnetic screen, and 
when it covers the cube of zellin the oyd power 
is shut Qff. But the instant the front of the 
screen is raised the attracting force sets in, and 
,we move.” 

“Most remarkable!” cried Prebble. “The 
amount of power is regulated by lifting the front 
of the screen?” 

“Exactly. If the front is raised one-third, 
the oyd force, or attraction, is only one-third; 
but raised one-half, the attraction is one-half 
the power of the zellin cube* and so on. Hence 
we proceed at a slow‘pace, a,t a run, or, with the 
full power of the cube, we all but fly.” 

Prebble struck his hands together in ecstasy* 

“How large is the cube, your lordship?” he 
tasked. 



Cold Facts About a Warm Country. 

This car is fitted with a twelve-inch block, 
which is a twenty-four-man power. A six-inch 
cube would be a twelve-man power, a twenty- 
four-inch cube would be a forty-eight-man power, s 
and so on.” 

Is the force of the polar attraction always 

the same?” 

“Always.” 

“And always attracts due north ?” 

“The attraction is continually toward the pole.” 

“How are you able to proceed in anything bud 
a straight line?” 

“That lever on Klimon’s left connects with the 
wheel at the rear point. The turning of thad 
wheel acts as a rudder, and steers us easterly 
or westerly.” 

“Beautiful, beautiful! But if you wish to go 
south, directly away from the pole? Your rud¬ 
der couldn’t help you to move in that direction.”' 

“Certainly not. When we wish to go souths 
ward we make use of the suboyd power.” 

“What is that, pray?” 

“Do you not know that there is another mag- 
netic pole ? The other is simply a focus of mag- 



8 o 


Cold Facts About a IV arm Country . 

netic power, and is the one that attracts the needle 
of the mariner’s compass-” 

“Ah, yes!” murmured Prebble. “That pole is 
located in seventy-one north and ninety-six west.” 

“It is the source of our suboyd power,” re¬ 
sumed his lordship. “There is another screened 
box under Klimon’s feet. This second box in¬ 
closes a cube of soft iron. If we wish to travel 
due south, or in any direction east or west by 
south, the cube of zellin is screened entirely, and 
the cube of iron is switched forward on a mov¬ 
able arm. The ratio of power in the suboyd cube 
is exactly the same as in the oyd block.” 

“How beautifully Nature has cared for you 
in this delightful country!” chirruped the pro¬ 
fessor. “Beyond the ice wall we know nothing 
of the oyd or suboyd powers. The force th$t 
attracts your cube of soft iron is barely sufficient 
to sway our magnetic needle. How do you ex¬ 
plain the difference in the power of your country 
and ours?” 

“1 don’t explain it,” said Lord Nylis. “It is 
one of Nature’s inscrutable laws.” 

We were traveling swiftly over a well-paved 



Cold Facts About a Warm Country. 8i 

road. The breath of June was in the air, green 
groves and flower-strewn meadows stretched on 
both sides of us, and as we journeyed I caught 
glimpses of strange-looking houses half hidden 
by the trees. 

The people we passed, or who came down to the 
roadway to look at us, were all of a kind with 
the men and women we had already seen, albeit 
of lower station. But I saw none of them at 
work. 

The country blossomed as the rose, yet no yel¬ 
low-haired laborers were in the fields. I asked 
Lord Nylis about this. 

“We labor with the mind, not with the hands,” 
he replied. “What the oyd and suboyd force can¬ 
not accomplish, the Churs take care of. 

My brain was overwhelmed with all this riot 
of new sensations and unheard-of conditions. 
'Prebble and I had been dropped into a country 
as different from our own as our minds could 
conceive. 

There were a thousand and one questions T 
wanted to ask, but their very multitude appalled 
and silenced me. 



82 Cold Facts About a Warm Country* 

I thought of the pole, and, in spite of the 
savage Churs, I determined to reach it just as 
soon as I had familiarized myself somewhat witK 
the ways of the. country, and could plan intelli¬ 
gently. Certainly if I could not get to the pole, 
Griffyn would not be able to do so. 

From the pole my thoughts wandered to the 
Princess Ylma. Her lovely face was before me* 
the rich cadences of her voice in my ears. 

Ah, if fortune would be kind to me! If I 
could win her and carry her back to my own courn 
try and my own people- 

I came to myself with a guilty start. WhaflT 
crazy notion had taken possession of me, that 
I should raise my eyes to a princess of the blood? 

I tried to banish her from my thoughts, but her 
entrancing features and dulcet voice would not 
allow themselves ,to be ignored. 

I recalled the smile she gave me; and then I 
recalled my missing mukluks, and turned toward! 
my two companions. Prebble was just asking 
for a test of speed—he wanted to see how fast 
the oyd car could run. 

“Full power, Klimon!” said Lord Nylis. 



Cold Facts jrlbout a 11 anil Country . 83 

The Chur opened the screen to its full extent, 
and die carriage leaped away like a bullet from 
a gun. I clung to the professor, and die pro¬ 
fessor clung to me. 

Houses, people, trees passed so swiftly that 
they danced on the sight in blurring lines. Fi¬ 
nally we slowed down by degrees and came to a 
halt in front of his lordship’s palace. 

“Thank Heaven!” I exclaimed. 

“Hurrah for the oyd power 1 ” cried the pro¬ 
fessor, beside himself. “The most wonderful 
power on earth*!” 

“It is the making of the kingdom,” remarked 
Lord Nylis, as he descended. “Follow me, gentle¬ 
men.” 

This palace, as was fitting, was much smaller 
and less ornate than the one we had just quitted. 
Still, it was a gem in its way. 

On a terrace, amid flowers and shrubbery and 
splashing fountains, we reclined at length 011 
couches spread with downy robes of fur. The 
heat was such that the shade of the terrace was 
most refreshing. If I had had a cigar or a pipe, 
I would have been in a seventh heaven. 



84 Cold Facts About a Warm Country . 

Lord Nylis, having made us as comfortable 
as he could in the circumstances, excused himself 
for a space. Prebble peered at me as one in a. 
daze. He started to speak, then checked himself, 
as though he dared not trust his wonder to words. 

“Out with it, professor/' said I languidly. 
“What problem is bothering you just now?" 

“Not one problem, captain, but a hundred prob¬ 
lems!" sighed Prebble. “I’m all at sea over this 
astounding adventure." 

“Frozen fancies!" I laughed. “You're dream¬ 
ing it all. We’re still on the ice cap in the sleep¬ 
ing bag." 

“I hope not, I hope not!" he mumbled. “All 
these experiences with things new and before 
untried are too interestingjo be passed with any 
explanation of that sort. Of all the remarkable 
objects we have so far beheld, this"-—and he re¬ 
moved the glittering circlet from his brows— 
“easily carries off the palm. I wonder, ncrw," and 
he frowned, as his wits began working, “if we 
think in an alien language as well as talk in it? 
Does this ring exercise a power over our intellect 
to such an unheard-of degree, or_

“This is too pleasant an hour to be disturbed 
with riddles past our solving,” I broke in. “Sup¬ 
pose we consider a mistake we have made—a mis¬ 
take into which I was led by yourself.” 

He lifted his brows. “What mistake?” he in¬ 
quired. 

“When the anchor picked us oft* the ice cap,” I 
explained, “you asserted that it was carrying us 
south, and that the balloon was coming out of 
the north.” 

“That seemed a proper inference, captain, be¬ 
fore we were informed of our proximity to the 
pole while in the throne room. Even at this mo¬ 
ment I am inclined to take the information im¬ 
parted by that hook-nosed gentleman with a grain 
of salt. However, in a country of so many won¬ 
ders, perhaps it is not well to doubt anything. 
But—proceed.” 

“If Griffyn had come from the north,” I went 
on, “there was another proper inference that he 
had come from the pole, perhaps had discovered 

it” 

Erebble replaced the ring, and nodded, to sig¬ 
nify that he was following me.

“We have now proof/’ I continued, “that Grif¬ 
fyn was going north when he snatched us off 
the ice cap.” 

“We both tacitly realized and acknowledged 
that error in our audience with the king,” said, 
the professor. He chuckled. “The ruler of this 
delightful country told us that two fiends were 
to drop out of the skies and bring trouble. You 
very brilliantly informed his majesty that the 
fiends were none other than Griffyn and his com¬ 
panion in the halloon. Admirable! That was, 
indeed, a happy inspiration. If Griffyn and his 
friend will only come down, and let themselves 
be discovered, I fancy the king will have confi¬ 
dence in your assertion. That, captain, will mean 
continued safety for us.” 

“But,” I returned, “suppose the balloon comes 
down among the Churs!” 

“That, I take it, would prove a coup de grace 
for the Englishmen.” 

“I hope it won’t happen,” said I. 

Are you relenting toward Griffyn?” queried 
Prebble, somewhat surprised. 

I can t find it in my heart,” I answered, “to 



Cold Facts About a Warm Country . 87 

wish him ill to that extent. Think of the spears 
which we so narrowly escaped!” and I shud¬ 
dered. 

“I have a well-defined impression,” observed 
Prebble, after a little reflection, “that we shall 
presently be put to it to look after ourselves, so we 
may just as well cease worrying about the fate 
that is to overtake Griffyn.” 

“Aye,” was my answer, “we have bought our 
lives at the price of a flask of bourbon. No good 
can come of such a transaction;” and I felt moody 
and apprehensive. 

“I have been expecting applause from you on 
the score of that flask of bourbon,” said Prebble, 
a little hurt. “You turned a point concerning 
Griffyn and his fellow voyager being the ex¬ 
pected fiends, and I shook hands with you, and—• 
er—well, I gloated. Now you rebuke me for 
turning a point with the whisky.” 

“Not at all,” I hastened to answer. “You saved 
our lives, and I appreciate your resourcefulness, 
even though I overlook the selfish manner in, 
which you stowed away that-flask while we were 



88 Cold Facts About a Warm Country . 

on the ice cap. A flask and a revolver! I knew 
nothing about .these, my friend.” 

“Each has done its part in preserving us, cap¬ 
tain. The end, therefore, has justified the means. 
Let it pass. The oyd and suboyd powers are 
much in my mind Here we have subtle forces' 
fully controlled and made to perform the will of 
man. The people of this land have invented them¬ 
selves into that blissful ^state where labor is un¬ 
necessary. By sheer force of the intellect they con¬ 
quer and hold in subjection the Churs, and make 
the hairy savages do menial service. The life 
of the ruling race seems to be a life of enjoy¬ 
ment.” 

“Which is not, and can never be, a successful 
life,” I declared. “The dignity of labor is needed 
to round out the lives of this ruling race. If 
this situation has continued for any length of 
time, then something is due to happen.” 

“Captain,” agreed Prebble, “you are probably 
correct. But, after our wearing struggles with 
the ice, a period of idleness affords a most re¬ 
freshing prospect.” 

I nodded. 



Cold Facts About a Warm Country . 89 

“But,” said Prebble, growing disputatious, “al¬ 
though the rulers of this land do not work with 
their hands, let us not suppose that they are idle. 
Their minds must be busy. And such minds! 
The mental effort necessary to keep the enslaved 
Churs under subjection must be enormous.” 

At that moment Lord Nylis returned and seated 
himself on a couch beside us. 



CHAPTER VIII. 


A BOURBON MENACE. 

“What is the name of this country, your lord- 
ship?” I asked. 

“We call it Nyll,” he answered. 

“And what is the name of the reigning house?” 

“Boazar. Boazar III. is now on the throne.” 

“Has he many children?” 

I was slowly working up to the subject that 
was becoming as dear to my heart as the dis¬ 
covery of the pole. 

“One only, the Princess Ylma.” His lord¬ 
ship’s voice saddened as he added, with a gloonjy 
shake of the head: “Poor Princess Ylma!” 

I roused to inquire why the Princess Ylma 
should be the object of his commiseration, when 
Prebble broke in ahead of me with a question on 
an altogether different matter. 

“Whence comes this heat, Lord Nylis? You 
have the sun here for six months at a time, but 
it does not-furnish sufficient caloric for, a cli¬ 
mate like this.” 



A Bourbon Menace. 91 

“The friction of the earth in its rotation around 
the pole generates the heat,” his lordship ex¬ 
plained. 

“But the pole is figurative,” demurred the pro¬ 
fessor. *‘The earth can cause no friction in turn¬ 
ing around a figurative axis.” 

“The axis is not figurative. The pole is a 
real one.” 

“Of course it is,” said I. “What do you think 
Tm looking for, Prebble?” 

He turned his head and blinked at me through 
his glasses. 

“We’re learning things, Captain Salis,” said 
he, “that no two men outside of Nyll ever learned 
before.” He pressed one hand to his temples. 
“Merciful powers, my head is splitting! This 
is morning, isn’t it, Lord sNylis ?” 

“Yes,” replied his lordship, “the morning of 
the long day.” 

“When do you dine?” inquired Prebble, mois¬ 
tening his lips with his tongue, and thinking^ 
no doubt, of the good things we had had at the: 
palace of King Boazar, 



A Bpurbjn Menace . 

“In' two weeks and three days/’ said Lord 
Nylis. 

I was startled. Prebble nearly fell off his 
couch. His lordship noticed our astonishment, 
and added: 

“We eat but three times daily/’ 

“That's our custom in our own country/’ I 
Commented. 

“But our days are six months long.” 

I groaned. 

“And you eat only once in two months?” I 
asked. 

“Three months intervene between breakfast 
and dinner, and dinner and supper. We sleep 
throughout the long night.” 

‘Tm not a bear—I can’t hibernate,” said Preb¬ 
ble, rearing up on his elbows and looking at me. 
“Captain, let's go home!” 

Although his frame was meager and showed 
no results of high living, I yet knew that Prebble 
was fond of his meals, and something of an epi¬ 
cure. 

“Home!” I exclaimed. “You invent the flying 
machine, professor, and I’ll navigate it. Until 



A Bourbon Menace. 


93 

you do, don't talk about home. You’re wasting 
your time.” 

‘‘There, there, my friends,” put in Lord Nylis 
smilingly, “we shall not expect you to abide by 
our customs in this respect. Eat when you feel 
like it, sleep when you wish. You shall have the 
run of the larder and untrammeled use of the 
dormitory. The' king’s orders, gentlemen. My 
humble roof is yours.” 

“Many thanks, your lordship," said Prebble, 
himself again. “I am a man of science, but my 
stomach is my weak point. I believe that even 

now I could—er—relish a glass of-—of- By 

the way, what do you drink in this glorious land?” 

“Water.” 

“Nothing but water?” 

“We have nothing else. We find water suffi¬ 
cient.” 

Prebble was forgetting himself. Had there 
been any alcoholic beverages in the kingdom, that 
flask of bourbon would have been no novelty to 
the king. 

A glitter came into the eyes of our host, and 
he -rested a keen glance on my friend. 



94 


A Bourbon Menace . 


“I suppose/' said he, “that your Elixir of Life 
is the common beverage in the land from which 
you come?" 

Prebble coughed. 

“It is not so plentiful as to be what you might 
call common, Lord Nylis,” said he. “Not,” he 
went on hastily, “that there is a scarcity of it. 
On the contrary, it is to be found nearly every¬ 
where, but it is for the select few who are able 
to—er—secure it.” 

Prebble's quibbling was carrying him into deep 
places. It was a subject, moreover, which made 
me uneasy. I attempted to shift the topic. 

“I should like to know something more about 
this Princess Ylma, Lord Nylis,” I remarked, 
with assumed carelessness. 

He affected not to hear me. 

“You,” he went on, studying the professor at¬ 
tentively, “must surely be of the select few who 
are able to obtain the elixir?” 

“Why, yes,” replied Prebble. “As need mani¬ 
fested itself, I have had my share of the potent 
fluid. I am a scientist, however, and know where 



A Bourbon Menace . 


95 ; 

to draw the line. “Now,” he went on, with abrupt 

eagerness, “about this oyd force-” 

He was clearly as distrustful of the matter 
Lord Nylis was pressing as I was; also, he was 
seeking to give another turn to the conversation. 
His lordship, however, was not to be shaken. He 
clung to the subject relentlessly. 

As I covertly watched the eyes of our host, an 
uncanny conviction that they were probing deeper 
than his tongue laid hold of me. What unplumbed 
depths lay at the back of his lordship’s penetrat¬ 
ing glances ? 

“You informed the king,” Lord Nylis inter¬ 
rupted Prebble to remark, “that you and your 
friend are very great prophets in your own land.” 

The professor made a heroic effort to appear 
at ease, and to meet the issue plausibly. 

“Exactly so,” he returned. “My o\yn prophetic 
line is scientific. The captain’s, on the other hand* 
is exploring. Whenever he goes exploring he 
takes me along fo furnish facts and figures, to 

work out various problems, to-” 

“The elixir, you claimed, was a pVoof of your, 
skill.” 



9 6 


A Bourbon Menace. 


I wished, in my soul, that something might 
happen to draw his lordship off. He was paying 
out more than enough rope to entangle Prebble 
and to trip him. „ The less that “elixir” was dis¬ 
cussed the better it would be for us. 

“Quite true,” asserted Prebble, with a panicky 
look in my direction. 

“Then,” scored Lord Xylis, “if you are a 
prophet, if the elixir is a product of your skill, and 
you know its virtues, and make use of them, why 
have you not renewed your own youth?” 

Prebble was silent. He showed his good sense 
by not plunging into some far-fetched explanation 
that would give his lordship a chance to score 
again. 

“And you”—here Lord Nylis turned to me— 
“is youth not a condition in much demand in your 
own country? Is growing* old so agreeable to 
those who live in your native land?” 

The professor answered for me. Perhaps he 
was even more afraid to trust me than he was 
to trust himself. 

“Gray hairs command respect,” said he, “and 
that is what our prophets demand more than 



A Bourbon Menace . 97 

youth—the respect born of gray hairs and wis¬ 
dom” 

This remark appeared to please Lord Nylis. 
The professor had touched his intellectual side, 
where he was strongest. 

“It seems, then,” said he, “that your country¬ 
men, particularly your prophets, reverence knowl¬ 
edge far more than they desire youth?” 

“That is the case, your lordship.” 

“Then, why do you give such a proof of your 
skill to your people? If it is wise to grow old 
in years and wisdom, even though you must die 
Tor it, why cater to folly with a beverage which 
keeps people young?” 

“All men do not think the same on a subject 
so broad as that,” coughed the professor, no doubt 
wishing he had left his lordship to talk with me. 

“Your elixir had a most remarkable effect upon 
the king!” 

“I was assured of that before I gave it to him,” 
said'Prebble. 

“His royal will was completely overturned.” 

“The elixir is warranted to overturn the will 
of any one, royal or otherwise.” 



9 8 


A Bourbon Menace. 


A troubled look, as I thought, crossed his lord- 
ship’s countenance. 

‘'It must be exceedingly powerful !” he ex¬ 
claimed. 

“I hesitate to describe the elixir’s full powers 
to you. Lord Nylis. Possibly you would not be¬ 
lieve me.” 

I was glad the professor hesitated. 

“The Princess Ylma,” I ventured, “saved us 
from the Churs. Naturally, your lordship, I 
should be glad to learn something about the young 
lady. The professor and I are deeply indebted 
to her, and-” 

“Pardon me,” Lord Nylis interrupted, “but the 
marvelous powers of your elixir have quite capti¬ 
vated my fancy. And yet,” he frowned a little as 
he spoke, “I have a premonition that it is not 
well for the people of this kingdom to renew 
their youth by means of your elixir. I feel, my 
friends, that I must go deeper into this subject. 
It is new, and——” 

At this juncture there was an interruption. I 
drew a deep breath of satisfaction, although cer¬ 
tainly I should not have felt such profound reliel 



A Bourbon Menace . 


99 

had I known, at the moment, all that the inter¬ 
ruption portended. 

Suddenly there came to our ears a loud shout 
from the direction of the road. We sprang up 
in time to see a large oyd car, with a dozen armed 
Churs and one Nyllite, sweep up to the palace 
steps. 

The instant the car stopped the warriors and 
the man in charge of them leaped to the ground 
and rushed up to the terrace. In another in¬ 
stant Prebble and I were surrounded. 

"Seize them!” commanded the Nyllite, who was 
captain of the king’s guard. 

Six spear points pricked my breast, and six 
pairs of ferocious, bloodshot eyes glared into 
mine. The professor was also at bay in a pre¬ 
cisely similar manner. 

"Count Zylox, what means this?” demanded 
the indignant Lord Nylis, confronting the cap¬ 
tain of the guard. 

"The king is dying!” cried the count excitedly. 

"Dying?” echoed his lordship, aghast. 

"Aye, and through the machinations of these 
foreign devils! Woe, woe to this land, Lord 



TOO 


A Bourbon Menace . 


Nylis! At this very instant King Boazar is 
stretched out on the dais, at the foot of the throne 
chair, rolling his eyes, gasping, and chokingly 
endeavoring to give his final orders.” 

“What does he say?” queried his horrified lord- 
ship. 

“We cannot understand his pitiful attempts at 
speech,” responded the tearful captain of the 
guard. “ ‘Whash mazzer/ it sounds like; ‘whash 
mazzer, whash mazzer/ over and over again. Ah, 
this is a sorry day for our beloved country. Our 
good king! The last of the Boazars!” 

He whirled furiously upon the Churs who were 
threatening Prebble and me. 

“Bind the foreign devils!” he shrieked. “Their 
lives shall pay for this, and a poor enough forfeit 
it is!” 



CHAPTER IX, 

THE KING'S “PERIL/' 

Out of the frying pan into the fire is a homely 
expression, but it describes a situation which 
seemed to fit our case. The king was in no 
danger, but had used his “elixir” too freely. 

Yet how to convince Count Zylox of this be¬ 
fore we were drawn and quartered? That was 
the question. 

“If you ever thought in your life, Captain Salis, 
think now!” cried the professor, brushing the 
sweat from his forehead with a fold of his tunic. 

“Cords, cords!” shouted Count Zylox. “Lind 
them!” 

“Lord Nylis,” I exclaimed, “we appeal to you! 
The king is in no danger. I swear it!” 

“Danger?” repeated the captain of the guard. 
“He lies like a log, I tell you, and his end is near.” 

“Not so,” clamored the professor. “That is 
the way the elixir works. Did you not see me 
swallow it? And my friend, there? If it had 
been poison, we ourselves would be dead or dying. 



Look out, you relic of the Stone Age, you’re stick¬ 
ing me!” 

Prebble brushed aside a spear point that was 
making itself too keenly felt. 

“What he says is true,” I averred. “In a few 
hours the king will be himself again.” 

“I will not believe it!” was the fierce response 
of Count Zylox. “Rather than bother with bind¬ 
ing them, it would perhaps be as well for us to 
run them through-” 

“Not that!” spoke up Lord Nylis. “The king 
has placed these gentlemen in my charge, and I 
am responsible for them with my head.” 

“But the king is passing! He is-^-” 

“These gentlemen say not. I yield up my 
guests only on the king’s orders, Count Zylox.” 

“The king is incapable of giving orders.” 

“He will issue them when he is capable.” 

“What if he dies?” 

“In that event I take my commands from Prin¬ 
cess Ylma.” 

Count Zylox was an exceedingly angry man. 
He stamped about the terrace in his buskins. 

“My hospitality has taken a rather grim turn* 



The King's “Peril” 


103 


count," observed his lordship. “I must request 
that you have your Churs lower their weapons/' 

“And permit these foreign devils to escape?’' 
cried the exasperated count. 

“By no means. Guard them until we have 
further news of the king." 

The count gnawed his under lip for a moment. 
Then he said: 

“We will tarry three hours. By that time a 
courier from the palace will let us know whether 
the king lives or is dead." 

“If he lives his wishes will be brought by the 
courier," said Lord Nylis, “and shall be implicitly 
obeyed." 

“And if he dies?" 

“If he dies, these foreigners shall suffer death 
by oyd." 

“’Tis well/’ said the count, and gave orders 
that caused the Churs to withdraw and marshal 
themselves in a column behind Prebble and my¬ 
self. 

I sat down on my couch and Prebble sat down 
on his. This constant peril was most trying to 



104 


The King’s “Peril” 


the nerves, for we never seemed able to tell when 
the lightning was going to strike, or how. 

“This death by oyd,” murmured Prebble, “what 
is it, your lordship?” 

“If the king dies, and the Princess Ylma so 
commands, as she undoubtedly will in that event, 
your feet will be securely bound to the., feet of 
your friend. A twenty-four-man block of zellin, 
properly screened, will be chained to your wrists* 
and a twenty-four-man block, of iron will be 
chained to the wrists of your companion. The 
screens will then be raised by degrees. You 
will be pulled-north, your friend south. First, 
a force equivalent to six men will drag at your 
limbs, pulling against each other; then twelve 
men; then eighteen; then the full twenty-four,” 

It was awful to contemplate ! The very fiend¬ 
ishness of it fairly sickened me. 

“It is the punishment for high treason,” com¬ 
mented the count, glowering at us. 

“Wait six hours instead of three!” implored 
Prebble. 

“Three hours only!” snapped the count.. 

How slowly the minutes dragged! Surrounded 



The King's “Peril”

and guarded to make sure that we did not es¬ 
cape, Prebble and I endeavored to compose our 
nerves. 

“I was afraid of something like this, profes¬ 
sor,” said I. 

“It would be rather a humorous situation,” 
said Prebble, “if these Nyllites weren’t so igno^ 
rant. . What a sight for gods and men to see 
King Boazar prone upon the throne, surrounded 
by his grief-stricken court, and only giving vent 
to hiccups and gurgles, and the two mysterious 
words, ‘ Whash mazzer ?’” 

The professor forgot his own desperate situa¬ 
tion so far as to cackle with suppressed merri¬ 
ment. 

“IPs liable to be anything but a laughing mat¬ 
ter for you and me, Prebble,” I admonished him. 

“How can there be a tragedy? The king will 
come out of his trance, and word wall be sent to 
release us.” 

> v “Suppose the court doctors get busy with the 
king? They don’t understand what ails him, 
and they may resort to heroic measures. He may 
succumb to the measures, but the elixir will be

charged up with it; and, of course, we are already 
charged up with the elixir.” 

Prebble looked worried. 

“There’s something in that, captain,” he fal¬ 
tered. “I wish we could get word to those doc¬ 
tors to keep their hands off.” 

“What good would it do us to get word to 
them?” I inquired. “Do you think they would 
pay any attention to our wishes in the matter, 
one way or the other?” 

“Possibly not.” 

“Certainly not. There’s not a doubt as to the 
position we occupy in the Land of Idyll.” 

“Let us suppose,” said the professor, “that the 
king’s case is not aggravated by the solicitude of 
his physicians. Our dangers will pass, in that 
event.” 

“Very likely, providing these troublesome 
Churs are not goaded into something violent by 
Zylox.” 

The captain of the guard was still tramping 
fretfully up and down, itching to be at us, and 

yet not daring to override the instructions of 
the king. 



The King's “Peril” ioy 

“The count is in a hard row of stumps,” I went 
on, to Prebble. “He’d give his eyes to see us 
impaled on the points of those spears; but if the' 
king should recover the count would be called 
on to pay with his head for his rash actions.” 

“And Lord Nylis, too,” added Prebble. “An 
execution by oyd,” he proceeded, his thoughts tak- 
ing a gruesome trend, “must be a particularly 
horrible performance.” 

“It has the electric chair beaten both ways,” 
said I. “Slowly, but relentlessly, a victim is 
pulled to pieces.” 

A sickening pallor spread itself over the pro¬ 
fessor’s face. Sitting upright on his couch, he 
shaded his eyes with one hand and looked oif 
along the road that led to the palace. 

“I wonder why some one doesn’t come from 
the king?” he worried. 

“No one will come until the king either dies 
or recovers sufficiently to tell his court that he 
has no intention of dying,” I answered. 

Lord N}dis, observing that some of the Churs 
were becoming rather overzealous in their guard 
duty, placed himself closer to Prebble and me. 



io8 


The King's “Peril” 


A single look which he threw at the hairy war¬ 
riors dampened their vengeful ardor, and they 
drew back. 

“This condition of his majesty,” remarked his 
lordship, turning, to Prebble, “seems an odd way 
of renewing youth. And yet you declare that 
the elixir works in that manner?” 

“His majesty took too much of it,” said Preb¬ 
ble. 

“Too much is dangerous?” 

“Not at all. Too much merely stupefies.” 

“So the king is out of his senses?” 

“Nothing worse has befallen him, Lord Nylis, 
I assure you. Are there many court physicians?” 

“A dozen or more.” 

“Do you suppose the whole dozen of them are 
working over the king?” 

“Undoubtedly.” 

Prebble could not restrain a groan. 

“A dozen doctors, captain,” said he, turning 
in my direction, “are apt to cause tragic compli¬ 
cations.” 

The doctors, just then, were a prolific source 
of danger for the professor and me; and, second 



The King's “Peril” 


109 

only to the doctors, stood Count Zylox and the 
Chur guard. 

' The physicians will do everything possible,” 
spoke up Lord Nylis, hoping, no doubt, to set 
us at our ease. 

Could you not send word to the physicians,” 
returned Prebble, '‘that all the king needs is to 
be let alone?” 

“The physicians, I presume, do not understand 
the king’s malady,” said Nylis, “but certainly 
they can do no harm.” 

“Send word, anyhow!” implored Prebble. “Tell 
the messenger to announce at the palace that the 
strangers guarantee the king’s recovery, but that 
the physicians must not mix up in the matter.” 

“If I did that, and the king did not recover,” 
said Lord Nylis, “I should be condemned to death 
myself.” 

There was no use insisting, and the minutes 
continued t?b drag. It seemed as though I had 
lived an age before my eyes, eagerly scanning the 
road, saw a small oyd car come flying to his 
lordship’s steps. 

One Chur and one Nyllite were the passengers. 



HIO 


The King’s “Peril.” 


Bounding to the ground, the Nyllite dashed up 
the slope toward us, flashing the king's ring in 
his hand. 

“I come from Princess Ylma!" cried the cou¬ 
rier. 

Why the Princess Ylma? I asked myself. If 
the king was not dead, why was the Princess 
Ylma assuming the prerogatives of government ? 



CHAPTER X. 


PREBBLE WORKS A SPELL’. 

“What of the king?” demanded the count. 

“He recovers!” 

“I told you so!” jubilated the professor. 

“Is he well?” asked the count. 

“Barring a headache. The lords in waiting 
are attending him.” 

“What says the Princess Ylma?” 

“That under no circumstances are the stran¬ 
gers to be injured.” 

I began to breathe once more. Prebble was 
again his cocksure and assertive self. 

The count came forward, and I thought he 
looked like a disappointed man. He bowed to 
lis humbly. 

“Pardon the disagreeable interruption,” said 
he. “When I come again it will be by his majes¬ 
ty’s command.” 

He gave orders to his Churs, and they defiled 
toward their oyd car. The messenger had already 



1 12 Prebble Works a SpelL. 

returned to his, and was racing back whence he 
came. 

Presently the larger car got in motion, and 
we were left alone with our genial host, as before. 
Prebble, settling himself comfortably on his 
couch, continued to delve for facts. 

“Regarding these Churs,” said he, “are they 

animals, pure and simple, your lordship ?” 

/ * 

“Whether or not they have souls,” replied his 
lordship, “is a moot point. They have- a certain 
amount of reason, but are so brutelike that only 
our superior minds hold them in check. A com¬ 
mission of our wisest men, appointed by the king, 
is now making experiments to discover whether 
the Churs are imbued with the immortal spark.” 

“They are all slaves ?” 

“Every one outside the great wall. If they 
were not held down with a will of iron they would 
rebel and seek to overthrow us. Fear alone keeps 
the horde of Churs back of the great wall. If 
they once lost this fear they would swarm over 
the wall and lay this kingdom in ashes.” 

Wall? queried the professor, scenting an¬ 
other mystery. 



Prebble Works a Spell. 1x3 

“Boazar I., of illustrious memory, encircled the 
land of the Churs with a great wall of granite. 
Since then our minds have developed in power 
to an extent that gives us no fear of our tradi¬ 
tional enemies. The only disaster that could be 
fall us would be a dethronement of reason, an 
ellipse of our faculties. This would give the 
Churs their opportunity. 

“But”-—and here his lordship straightened 
proudly—“our brains continue to improve, while 
the Churs continue to sink into barbarism and 
brutality. Some day we shall grow so strong 
that we can invade the country of the Churs, en¬ 
slave them all, and after that gradually train 
them, and so better their condition. It is the 
dream of Boazar III. one day to emancipate the 
slaves. But this will not come for many genera¬ 
tions, not until such an act is entirely safe.” 

“You speak of the Churs as traditional ene¬ 
mies ?" 

“They were here vdien Lokai the Bold broke 
through the ice wall- and settled the land, an event 
which took place in the night of prehistoric times. 
Then the Churs roamed through the sun of the

114 

long day, and through the blackness of the long 
night, fighting, rending each other like beasts. 

“Lokai warred with them, and drove them out 
with sword and spear. But sword and spear were 
useless against them. They multiplied amazingly 
and returned again and again to the attack. Only 
the irresistible powers of the brain were effica¬ 
cious, and not until the descendants of Lokai be¬ 
gan to develop and use these latent powers was 
there any peace in the land.” 

“This is glorious,” murmured the professor. 
“It is an ideal state—a Kingdom of the Mind 
with the Powers of Darkness under heel. But 
here’s a point: Yotfr ancestor, Lokai the Bold* 
penetrated the ice wall. Have your people never 
tried to reach the world whence he came?” 

“Expedition after expedition has tried, but, 
in all save one instance, without success. The 
cultivation of mental powers has ill prepared us 
to cope with the rigors of ice and cold. BrutQ 
endurance is needed there. 

“Nevertheless, in our own generation the ice 
has been successfully conquered by one Gneiseii.. 
He did not live to return, but^sent back a gorr,

plate tied to an eagle’s leg. The gorr plate told 
us things of the outside world that have entirely 
wiped out all desire to know more about it.” 

“Gorr plate!” exclaimed Prebble. “The deeper 
we go the thicker the mysteries. What, in the 
name of all that’s good, is a gorr plate?” 

“It is a square of chalcedony, a thought record. 
We wish to communicate with one another, so 
we send thoughts and impressions, not words. 
On the chalcedony square we place our hands, 
,we think, the thoughts record themselves in the 
plate. The plate is sent to the one we would 
have know our wishes or experiences, and he or 
she lays‘ hands on the plate and the thoughts 
of the communicant come to the brain.” 

Prebble jumped to his feet and walked around 
his couch. Then he sat down again, his head 
in his hands. 

“Have you one of these gorr plates in your 
pocket?” he inquired. 

Lord Nylis smiled. 

“No; but if I had it would be nothing but so 
much chalcedony to you. Your mind pardon 
me—is not cultivated along the proper lines. 



ii6 


Prebble Works a Spell . 


At this implied doubt of his mentality, Prebble 
bristled up. The next moment, however, the irri¬ 
tation passed. 

“Will you read this gorr plate‘ Sent home by 
Gneisen?” he asked. 

“It is in the archives of the king's palace. But 
I have the gist of it in my mind." 

“What were Gneisen's thoughts?" 

“Horrible! He recorded impressions of two 
things in particular that filled me with disgust, 
and despair, for the human race. Gne of these- 
things was a thin silver disk, with a woman’s 
head on one side and an eagle on the other. 
There was also a motto: Tn God We Trust.' 

“The desire to accumulate these fetiches was 
so strong that people did not hesitate to betray 
a trust, bartering their honor and sometimes their, 
lives for the insensate objects. There were those 
who had millions more of these than they needed, 
and others who had not one. It was a mad 
race, according to Gneisen, and many of the 
.weaker were crushed, trampled on, and slain.” 

The professor looked at me and indulged in a

117 


sly wink. His lordship was on ground familiar to 
us, but neither Prebble nor I had anything to say. 

“What was the other thing that filled you with 
disgust and despair, Lord Nylis?” queried the 
professor. 

“It was a brown fluid in glass receptacles,” 
went on his lordship. “This fluid was even more 
insatiable in devouring honor and life than was 
the silver disk. It struck at the mind with sledge¬ 
hammer blows, according to Gneisen, making 
raving beasts of sensible men, and finally brought 
horrible death. The wonder is that sensible men 
would have anything to do with it. Do you 
know anything about this fluid?” 

“I believe I have heard of it,” mumbled the 
professor. “Talking about gorr plates, is it possi¬ 
ble to-” 

Prebble thus deftly shifted the topic. The gorr 
plates were wonderful enough, but I was not 
particularh' interested in them at that moment. 

My fancies flew to Princess Ylma. \ oung, 
beautiful, only child of the reigning king—what 
could there be in such a fate to commend tke 
princess to his lordship s commiseration? 



ii8 


Prebble Works a Spell 


I resolved to find out. At that moment Lord 
Nylis was deep in an earnest discussion with 
Prebble, and while waiting for a chance to put in 
a word on my own account I fell asleep. 

How long I slept is of no importance. The 
period seemed brief, but it may have been hours 
in duration. 

I wakened abruptly and started to a sitting pos¬ 
ture. His lordship was gone, but on the couch 
nearest mine lay Prebble, Count Zylox standing 
over him. 

Behind the count was the same detachment of 
soldiers that had accompanied him on his pre¬ 
vious visit. The professor was just opening his 
eyes. 

“You here again!” he exclaimed, starting up 
and casting a quick glance at the forbidding faces 
of the Churs. 

“By the king’s express command,” answered 
the count. 

“How is his royal highness?” inquired Prebble. 

“I-Ie is feeling much better, and desires that 
you refill this flask forthwith.” The captain drew 
the bottle from the breast of his tunic and ex* 



!Prebble Works a Spell . TI g 

tended it toward Prebble. “His majesty must 
have more of your elixir within the hour. ,, 

Blockheads that we were! Why had we not 
foreseen this contingency? 

Still, if we hod foreseen it, what could we 
have done to save ourselves? It is possible we 
could have stolen an oyd car, given the zellin 
cube free reign, and thus reached the pole. 

Would we have bettered our condition by so 
doing? Might not the savage Churs have killed 
us out of hand? 

There was no time to waste in useless surmises. 
Count Zylox represented the king, and the king 
meant business. 

“Mercy on us, man!” gurgled the professor. 
“Do you think I carry a supply of the elixir 
ground with me and have it constantly on tap?” 

The count smiled sardonically. 

“I think nothing at all. The king commands 
that I bring him the elixir within the hour. If 
you refuse to comply with his reasonable demand 
I am to convey you into the serene presence on 
the point of a spear. As to which I do, I am in¬ 
different.” 



120 


Prebble Works a Spell. 


Zylox had educated his* head at the expense of 
his heart. He had no kindly feeling for us, and 
orders were orders. 

Poor old Prebble! I see him now as I saw him 
then, clasping his bony hands, shaking as with 
an ague, looking despairingly from the count to 
the file of Churs. 

Suddenly he sank back on the couch with a 
muffled groan, his stony eyes upturned to the 
cloudless vault overhead. 

“Where is Lord Nylis?” I struck in, thinking 
our host might devise some way out of the diffi¬ 
culty. 

“Lord Nylis can be of no assistance to yot1,‘ , 
returned the officer frigidly. “Am I to have the 
elixir or am I not?” 

“I must consult privately with the other 
prophet, my companion,” said Prebble. “This is 
a matter of some moment. Have I your permis¬ 
sion to engage my friend in a brief conversa¬ 
tion?” 

“Escape is impossible,” warned Count Zylox 
sternly. 

“I am not contemplating anything of that sort.” 



Prebble Works a Spell. 


121 


4 ‘Very well. Proceed with your conversation.” 

The professor got up, came over to my couch, 
and sat down beside me. 

“Captain,” said he, ‘'were you asleep, or did 
you wake up in time to hear what was going 
on?” 

“I overheard it all,” I replied. 

“Well, what are we to do in this case?” 

“There’s not a thing we can do, so far as I 
can discover. The king has sent an ultimatum. 
'More elixir, or death to the strangers. It was a 
mistake to tell the king that the bourbon was a 
product of our skill.” 

“I presume,” reflected Prebble, "that the 
whisky could be distilled, but it would take time.” 

“And the king is in a hurry!” 

“We’ve got to fill the flask at once, or suffer 
the consequences.” 

“Then we must suffer the consequences,” said 
I cheerlessly. 

The professor’s problems were growing more 
and more difficult of solution. Largely our pres¬ 
ent predicament was owing to the professor s ex¬ 
travagant claims with respect to our powers a £ 



II22 


Prebble Works a Spell 


prophets. A prophet is not really a wizard, and 
yet my learned companion, in our conference with 
the king, had father implied that such was the 
Case. 

While Count Zylox watched warily from a dis¬ 
tance, and the barbarians of his guard stood ready 
to discourage any attempt at escape, the professor 
puckered up his brows and turned the matter over 
in his mind. 

“You might as well give up, Prebble,” said I. 
“Don’t harass yourself with further posing. You 
Can’t conjure a demijohn of rum out of the air. 
Tell Zylox to do his worst.” 

“If we could secure another audience with the 
king,” returned Prebble, “we might be able to do 
something that would postpone our fate.” 

“Don’t deceive yourself. The king is thor¬ 
oughly in earnest. When an appetite for bour¬ 
bon is aroused, you know how difficult it is to 
combat it.” 

“I do—none better. The imperial appetite' 
waits only upon the imperial will, and the king’s 
word is law. But, captain, perhaps if I told his 
majesty that a little time would be required to 



'Prebble Works a Spell. 


1 23 

minister to his desires he would grant a stay of 
sentence. 5 ’ 

‘‘That would only prolong the agony,” said I, 
“and what’s the use.” 

“While there’s life there’s hope. So long as 
we can keep from being spitted on the lances of 
the Churs, or from being drawn and quartered 
by oyd^ and suboyd, I choose to believe that 
chances of ultimate escape will favor us.” 

“That may be. I am as anxious to live as you 
are, Prebble, for the object of my lifelong ambi¬ 
tion has been to attain the pole. Now that we 
are so near the pole, it seems too bad that chance, 
and a flask of bourbon, should conspire to dis¬ 
appoint me.” 

“Suppose we could escape now,” murmured the 
professor, with a wary glance at Zylox and the 
Churs.*" 

“Such a supposition is folly!” I protested. 

“No one knows what a man can do to save 
his life until he is put to the test. A rush, an 
exchange of blows, and a little of that fortune 
which favors the brave and the desperate, might 
carry us to the road and the oyd car. Then away, 



124 


Prebble Works a Spell 


captain—away!—with the screens torn from the 
cube of zellin, and dur speed an eagle's flight!" 

I stared at him in amazement. If my own 
action in seeking to escape from the throne room 
had been reckless and ill-considered, Prebble’s 
present suggestion was even more so. 

“You are out of your wits, Prebble,” said I. 
“In the first place, we could never get clear of 
this press of Churs alive. Takeihat for granted 
at the outset.” 

“I grant you this, captain, that it is a forlorn 
hope, but better that than no hope at all.” 

“It is not even a forlorn hope,” I went on se¬ 
verely. “Suppose we reached the car, therewould 
remain the operating of it. What do we know 
about that?” 

“We know what Lord Nylis. told us on the way 
here,” answered the professor confidently. "All 
one has to do in driving an oyd car is to lift the 
screen and steer.” 

“Admitting that we could escape from the 
guard and reach and successfully operate the car, 
where are we to go ?” 

“Anywhere! Safety, lies in flight, JSalis, and; 



Prebble Works a Spell. 


125 

where that flight takes us is not a particular 
point/' 

“Yes, it is—most particular. If we could get 
to the pole-” 

“And fall into the hands of the Churs. Not 
that!” 

“Well, I shall not join you in any such mad 
enterprise. If argument can’t save us, force cer¬ 
tainly cannot/’ 

He got up and went back to his own couch. 
Flinging hitnself down on his back, he fixed his 
eyes thoughtfully upon the zenith. 

Seeing that our interview had terminated, the 
impatient Zylox approached the professor. 

“Have you decided?” the count demanded. 

“I am waiting to be moved in the business,” 
mumbled the professor. 

“Time presses!” returned Zylox. “Again I ask 
you: Am I to have the elixir, or am I not?” 

“You are!” screeched Prebble, hurling himself 
to his feet. '“I told the king I was a great prophet, 
and you shall see I am not without honor even 
in this country. Observe! Watch! I shall work 



126 Prehble Works a Spell 

a spell to fulfill the king's desire. Ah, ha 1 Rootn, 
there! Give me room!" 

They # gave him room, plenty of it. I feared 
that danger had suddenly turned the professor’s 
brain, and that he had gone stark, staring mad. 

He whooped, he howled; he threw himself into 
the most amazing attitudes, and fanned the air 
with his arms. 

I looked on, horrified. Count Zylox gazed at the 
contortions of my learned friend in startled won¬ 
der. As for the Churs, their superstitious minds 
.were imagining dire things, and they seemed more 
than half inclined to run. 

Suddenly the air above us was rent with a ter¬ 
rific explosion. Simultaneously with the explo¬ 
sion the heavens were lighted by a flash of reddish 
fire, ghastly in the broad light of day. 

Every eye turned aloft. A blazing balloon 
was dropping earthward like a lead plummet; 
and following the airy track of the balloon, at 
slower pace and with hair-raising gyrations, was 
a parachute. 

Two men were clinging to the -parachute. 



Prebble Works a Spell . 


1 27 


recognized one of them as my rival, Griffyn; the 
other as Pollock, his secretary and companion. 

The burning balloon dropped into the road¬ 
way, the wickerwork car, loaded with food, scien¬ 
tific instruments, and other impedimenta, striking 
the ground with a prodigious thump. 

Griffyn and his companion alighted a moment 
later, on the terrace, and not more than a dozen 
feet from Prebble. 

The Englishmen were stunned by the shock 
and lay on the ground in a state of dazed be¬ 
wilderment. Without loss of a second, Prebble 
bounded to Griffyn, bent over him, searched his 
pockets, and arose triumphantly with a nickel-* 
plated flask. 

Turning upon the astounded captain of the 
guard, Prebble presented the flask, with a lovw 
bow. 

“The elixir is not in the same flask, count/' 
said he, “hut I do not think his majesty will b$ 
overparticular. It gives me great pleasure tQ 
comply with his majesty’s command. 



CHAPTER XL 


GRIFFYN AND POLLOCK. 

Prebble was not mad; on the contrary, he wasj 
very level-headed. But what would he have done 
if there had been no flask in the pockets of either 
Griffyn or his secretary? 

The professor afterward told me that in fall¬ 
ing backward on the couch the despairing gaze 
he turned upward had encountered the balloon. 

The airship was in difficulties, plunging wildly 
and making ready to fall. Griffyn and Pollock 
were even then taking to the void with their .para¬ 
chute. 

“Ideas came rapidly/' continued Prebble, “for 
I was between the Churs and the deep sea, so to 
speak, and your life as well as mine hung in the 
balance. Chances were that either Griffyn or 
Pollock had a flask, and those were the'chances 
I had to take. A special Providence watches over 
children and—and others, captain, and I got the 
(flask. ,, 

I think Count Zylox was deeply impressed. At 



Griffyn and Pollock. 


129 

any rate, his hand trembled as he took the flask 
from Prebble. 

The Churs were fiat on the ground, face down¬ 
ward. It was their customary attitude when any¬ 
thing occurred which, to them, was supernatu¬ 
ral. 

Before the count entirely recovered, or the 
Churs arose, Griffyn was on his feet, and had 
advanced to where I was standing. 

His face was vacuous, his eyes staring. He 
knew me, but it is one thing to cut a man from 
your balloon and launch him into eternity, and 
another thing to meet him again, front to front. 

Finally he spoke, but there was no sense to 
his words. I answered him, and that he failed 
to understand me was evident from the blank look 
he wore. 

What was wrong? Had I forgotten my mother 
tongue ? 

“Remove the talk ring, captain,” suggested 
Prebble. “He’s giving you English and you’re 
giving him Nyll.” 

I removed the talk ring. While wearing it 



130 Griffyn and Pollock . 

I thought in Nyll, talked in it, and my own lan¬ 
guage was a dead letter. 

“Captain Salis!” breathed Griffyn. “Captain 
C. G. Salis, U. S. A.! Can I believe my eyes ?” 

“You cast a brother mariner adrift in mid- 
heaven,^ said I cuttingly. “No wonder you are 
surprised to meet me again, alive and hearty.” 

“You took a base advantage of me,” he pro¬ 
tested warmly. “You attached yourselves to the 
drag anchor in the hope of reaching the pole 
neck and neck with myself.” 

“Rubbish!” I exploded. “You’re a sane man, 
Griffyn, and you do not really think that Prebble 
and I would do such a thing, and run the risk 
of having our lives battered out against the top 
of some iceberg.” 

He muttered in his beard. At last he ob¬ 
served : 

“We have been hovering over this country for 
hours, driven back and forth by one current and 
then another. The intense heat, or something 
else, burst our balloon, and the fire——” 

“I have no interest in your misadventures,” 
said I coldly. “You cut us adrift, and we were 



Griffyn and Pollock . 


I 3 I 

saved by a miracle, only to find ourselves in the 
midst of a sea of dangers. It will be your busi¬ 
ness to share some of these dangers with us.” 

Pollock came up just then, bursting with ques¬ 
tions. But Pollock was the kind of man I left 
out of my calculations. 

He was the son of a rich distiller, I had been 
informed, and his father had helped him to a 
place in Griffyn's expedition by subscribing 
twenty thousand pounds to the exploration fund. 

Count Zylox and Prebble were holding an ani¬ 
mated conversation, and I donned my talk ring 
to take part in it. 

“These are the two fiends spoken of in that 
tradition of yours, count,” the wily professor was 
saying. “Take them back with you to the king, 
keep them in confinement, and watch them well. ’ 

“It shall be done,” the count answered cheer- 
folly. 

Pie was showing a good deal of respect for us 
since the professor had worked his “spell. 

“Tell the king,” I put in, “that we request him 
not to deal with the prisoners in a summary man¬ 
ner.” 



132 


Griffyn and Pollock , 


Prebble threw a surprised look at me. He 
could not understand, I suppose, why I wished 
to spare the Englishmen, when they had shown 
no disposition to spare us. 

“I will carry your message to the, king,” said 
Count Zylox. 

Thereupon he ordered the Churs to make pris¬ 
oners of Griffyn and Pollock, but the Englishmen 
set their shoulders together and prepared to re¬ 
sist. I had never doubted Griffyn’s courage, so 
I was not surprised to find him showing his teeth. 

“It begins to look,” called the count to me, “as 
though these strangers would have to be roughly 
dealt with. Would you care to speak with them 
and give them a little good advice? I know of 
no way in which you could serve them better.” 

“I will see what I can do,” said I. 

Then, removing the mystical ring from my 
bro^s, I stepped up in front of Griffyn and Pol¬ 
lock. 

“Don’t be rash, Griffyn,” I advised him. “You 
are outnumbered, and you have just come through 
a severe shaking up.” 

“By Jove T he cried, brandishing his fists, “If 



Griffyn and Pollock. 


133 


these swabs are sickening- for something we’ll do 
our best to oblige them. What sort of a way is 
this to receive strangers ?” 

“Be tactful, and you will find these people hos¬ 
pitable and kind. Resort to violence, and you 
will let loose a storm that will break on your own 
head. I know, because I have had some expe¬ 
rience with the ways of the country/’ 

“What sort of a country is it?” 

“Really magnificent—and something of a para¬ 
dox. The inhabitants are well advanced in the 
arts and sciences, and the labor of the ruling 
race is entirely on the mental order. I haven’t 
been here long enough to make any detailed ex 
planations, but I can assure you that a resort to 
fisticuffs will not prosper your cause.” 

“What have you in your hand, there?” he 
asked, surveying the object curiously. 

“An example of the scientific progress we have 
found in this country,” I answered. “This is a 
talk ring, and——” 

“Talk ring?” he echoed, wide-eyed. 

“Precisely. By adjusting it properly I am able 



134 


Griffyn and Pollock . 


to think in the language of the people, and to 
talk to them, and to understand them/' 

“What bally l nonsense are you giving me?” 

“I am trying to tell you things which your in¬ 
credulity will not allow you to believe/’ said I, 
“but, for all that, I am speaking the truth.” 

“He is,” put in the professor, “but he is wasting 
his time. Count Zylox, in charge of the guard, 
is going to take you and Pollock, alive or dead, 
to the king of the country.. Salis, out of a gener¬ 
ous feeling toward you, which is not warranted 
by your past^ behavior, has volunteered to pur- 
suade you to go with the count without resistance. 
If you are wise, Griffyn, you will heed the advice 
of Captain Salis.” 

“Salis has something at the bach: of his head,” 
declared Griffyn suspiciously. “What are you 
up to?” he flung at me, point-blank. 

“Justified although I might be in acting and 
thinking otherwise,” I answered, “I do not wish 
to see any harm come to you, Griffyn.” 

“You are trying to beat me out in coming at the 
pole. Something tells me that you are playing 
the game, even now.” 



Griffyn and Pollock. 


135 

“Where do you think you are, Griffyn?” I in¬ 
quired. “In what latitude and longitude?” 

I haven t been able to take an observation for 
some time, and I haven’t the least idea,” said he. 

“You will discover all about that, and many 
other things of interest to you, if you go peace- 
fully with Count Zylox.” 

“HI.not!” he cried obstinately. “Here,” he 
added, reaching out his hand, “let me take your 
talk ring. If it is all you say, I’ll give this count 
a piece of my mind in short order.” 

Prebble looked at me and shook his head. He 
meant to signify that it would not be safe, just 
then, to make it possible for Griffyn to converse 
understanding^ with Count Zylox. Griffyn 
might do other things besides giving the count 
a piece of his mind. For instance, it would have 
been possible for him to give information that 
would be a detriment to Prebble and me. 

“1 shall not allow you to sample the powers of 
my talk ring,” I answered. 

“Do you know what my impression is?” asked 
Griffyn. 



136 Griffyn and Pollock. 

“I don't know as that matters materially, but 
you may as well tell us.” 

“You and Prebble are mad. As Pollock and I 
came down on the parachute we saw Prebble 
throwing himself about in a crazy sort of way. 
Why did he rob me of my flask? Why did he' 
hand it over to that fellow in the Mother Hub¬ 
bard? There’s a black business afoot, Salis, if 
it turns out that you and your friend are not 
mad.” 

“Will you go peaceably?” I asked, to cut the 
conference short. 

“We are going to fight to the last breath!” 
he averred. 

I put on the talk ring and stepped back. 

“They won’t listen to reason, Count Zylox,” 
said I. “Take them, but do it carefully.” 

Again the count ordered his Churs to make 
prisoners of Griffyn and Pollock. Although they 
resisted like true Britons, they were easily over¬ 
come and borne away. Zylox would also have 
carried off the wreck of the balloon had not Preb¬ 
ble vigorously objected. 

I could not imagine what Prebble wanted with 



137 


Griffyft and Pollock. 

the remains of the airship. In du arse, how¬ 
ever, his ideas were communicated to me, and I 
found them particularly bright. 

The departure of Zylox and th guard with 
the prisoners left Prebble and me alone, and to 
our owm devices. 

During these momentous events, Lord Nylis 
had not shown himself. Nor had any one issued 
from the palace to make inquiries, or to take 
part in the proceedings. 



CHAPTER XII. 


FLIGHT. 

The hour was ripe for something of moment 
to transpire, and I was not kept long in suspense. 

“Now, captain,” said Prebble, after a swift 
precautionary glance around us, “we must get 
to work without loss of time.” 

“At what sort of work?” I inquired. 

“You will find out presently. We must act 
first, and then do our talking.” 

He gathered up his tunic about his thin legs, 
and put off down the terrace toward the road. 
I hurried along in his wake and joined him be¬ 
side the wickerwork balloon car. 

Nothing remained of the basket but a jumble 
of broken reeds. There was a water can, knocked 
into a cocked hat, and trickling its contents over 
the road; also a number of scientific instruments, 
a shotgun and cartridge belt, and a bag contain¬ 
ing pemmican and ship's biscuit. 

The scientific instruments were ruined, but the 



Flight. 


139 


bag of food was in good condition, and the gun 
and ammunition appeared to be uninjured. 

“Bring the biscuit and pemmican, captain,” said 
Prebble, taking possession of the firearm and belt. 
“We’ll stow these away where we can find them 
when wanted, and then hold a council of war.” 

The articles were hidden in a clump of bushes, 
and we returned to our couches on the terrace. 
Prebble was rubbing his hands delightedly. 

“I counted on finding, the food,” said he, “but 
the shotgun and the ammunition were a stroke of 
luck. Just what we needed, too.” 

“You’re thinking of making a run for it, are 
you?” I asked. 

“Sh-h-h!” he returned, looking around appre¬ 
hensively. 

Coming over to my couch, he sat down be¬ 
side me. 

“There’s nothing else for it, captain,” he pro¬ 
ceeded. 

“I am of your opinion,” I returned. 

“Our position here is becoming untenable,” he 
resumed. “The king will want more of the elixir, 
and if it is not forthcoming we will be impaled 



(140 Flight . 

bn the same spear and conveyed into the royal 
presence/' 

“We might have reasoned that out before/' 
said I. 

“I thought it, but we needed time in which to 
recuperate after our long fast, and to adjust our¬ 
selves to certain conditions of the country. Food 
and rest have prepared us physically, and now; 
that we are acquainted with the mechanism of 
the oyd car, and are possessed of a shotgun and a 
bag of food, we are well equipped for flight/' 

“We must have the car.” 

“Cars are plentiful. We will lie in wait along 
the road; then, with the aid of the shotgun, you 
can take possession of the first car that comes 
along. After that, away to the south, en route 
for home!” 

“To the south!” I exclaimed. 

“Certainly ! We can't go astray, captain. The 
cube of iron will draw us along the proper road. 
We will make in the direction of least re¬ 
sistance.” 

“Good heavens!” I cried. “Do you think the 



oyd car will carry us over the ice wall and the 
open sea?” 

“How da we know there is an open sea? As 
for the ice wall, que transtulit, sustinet . Our good 
star is above us. South we must go—it is the 
only way.” 

“It is not the only way!” I declared. “Our 
hope lies in the zellin cube, and we must go 
whither it takes us.” 

“To the land of the Churs, my dear sir!” pal¬ 
pitated Prebble. “We would be slaughtered on 
sight. Have you not had sufficient experience 
with these man brutes?” 

“Remember how superstitious the Churs are,” 

I urged. “The report of that revolver was 
enough to vanquish them, and now we have a 
shotgun. Think of that!” 

“I read you, captain,” said the professor, dis¬ 
gruntled. “Griffyn has arrived. Your fear that 
he will reach the pole first impels you to take 
any chance, however desperate. I go south, sir!” 

“And I go north !” I returned firmly. “We will 
divide the pemmican and the ship’s biscuit.” 

“And the shotgun?” he asked coolly. 



!I4 2 Flight 

“We will draw straws for the shotgun. You 
can get your own oyd car, and I will-” 

“We cannot quarrel over this matter,” inter¬ 
rupted Prebble, “nor can we divide our slender 
force and resources in the face of such a desper¬ 
ate contingency. We must stand or fall together. 
Captain Salis.” 

“I am in charge of the expedition,” said I 
sternly. “When you joined it you agreed to obey 
orders.” 

“You are quite correct,” he answered. “I was 
overlooking that point.” 

“I am resolved to bear away to the land of the 
Churs. That is what we shall do. You are un¬ 
der my orders, and you will obey whatever-” 

“Hist! His lordship!” 

I looked up hastily. Lord Nylis was approach¬ 
ing us across the terrace. Klimon, in the road 
below, was sitting in the point of his lordship’s 
conveyance. 

“Gentlemen,” began Lord Nylis, his face trou¬ 
bled, the fame of your elixir has spread through¬ 
out the kingdom. To the lords in waiting his 
majesty has described its effects upon the system

so eloquently that all are wild to try the new 
fluid for themselves. The second flask the king 
claims as his own to the last drop. 

“But he orders you, through me, to work an¬ 
other spell for one thousand keeses of the elixir. 
If not too much trouble to you, he desires that 
you have it fall at the palace steps. Menials are 
already waiting there with goblets.” 

My heart smote wildly against my ribs. Had 
we been too late with our plans for flight? 

“How much is a keese, your lordship?” Preb- 
ble inquired, with a businesslike air. 

“Two blicks make one keese. A blick, I should 
say, is about the quantity contained in the second 
flask.” 

“In other words,” said Prebble briskly, “the 
king wants two thousand flasks of our elixir 
rained down in front of his palace?” 

“The menials are waiting,” his lordship re¬ 
peated, “and the king’s household is impatient.” 

“We shall have to repair to the king’s palace 
to make the incantation,” said Prebble. 

While speaking, he telegraphed me a message 



144 


Flight 

If we fled, it must be now or 


with his e 
never. 

Whether north or south made little difference. 
The thing was to get away before the household 
grew too impatient. 

“I imagined as much,” remarked his lordship 
gravely. “If you gentlemen will descend to the 
oyd car I will retire into the palace for ten min¬ 
utes, or less, and rejoin you the moment I have 
finished the business that detains me. This is 
important, or I should not delay.” 

Nothing could have been more opportune. His 
lordship went one way, and Prebble and I the 
other. 

“The bag of food and the gun,” muttered Preb¬ 
ble. “We must have those before we go to the 
oyd car.” 

Proceeding to the clump of bushes, we brought 
out the articles. As the executive end of the ex¬ 
pedition, I assumed charge of the gun and belt, 
strapping the latter over my tunic, about my 
waist. 

Next we stole silently upon the oyd car. Ap¬ 
proaching the unconscious Klimon from the rear 



I tumbled him incontinently into the road, and 
jumped into his seat. 

Prebble was already up behind. With the shot¬ 
gun firmly held between my knees, I bent over 
the power box and lifted the screen. 

Away jumped the car with a suddenness that 
almost threw the professor into the road. And 
not an instant too soon. 

The dazed Klimon had bounded to his feet, 
and grabbed at the rear of the vehicle, missing 
it by no more than a hairbreadth. He pursued 
us, but he might as well have tried to overtake 
a whirlwind. 

We were heading for the land of the Churs, 
and for the North Pole! All fear was lost in 
the excitement of the moment. 



CHAPTER XIII. 


PURSUIT. 

My nerves were not so preyed upon that reason 
failed me; and while bending over the zellin box, 
one hand on the screen and the other on the 
steering lever, I had a few thoughts pertinent to 
the situation. 

When we had left the king’s palace Klimon 
had used the zellin cube. That meant, of course, 
that we had proceeded in a northerly direction. 

To use the suboyd power, as represented by 
the iron block, would have been to drive back 
through the heart of the kingdom. Flight in that 
direction meant undoubted capture. 

Another point: I was not sufficiently familiar 
.with oyd cars to distinguish the iron box from 
the zellin box. 

His lordship’s car, however, had just come 
from the king’s palace. The zellin cube must 
have been used, and, therefore, it was reasonable 
to infer that this cube was still ready for duty. 

I did not pull out the screen to its fullest extent, 



! Pursuit. 


H7 

and thus give the car the full power. We could 
easily distance Klimon with half the oyd force, 
and I wanted to accustom myself to running the 
machine before urging it to its utmost. 

The car was easily handled. The rear wheel 
was the rudder, and its resistance was strong in 
moving any way short of due north. 

The “feel” of the tiller, if I may be allowed the 
expression, was an indication of the direction we 
.were going. As I figured it, we were headed 
north by east. 

Suddenly I was startled out of my reflections. 
-Directly ahead, and bearing down on us, was the 
official oyd car containing Count Zylox and the 
detachment of the guard. 

A groan came from Prebble. 

“They're after us, captain!” was the burden 
of his lament. 

I was of the same opinion. But there was no 
retreat for us, and we must go ahead and look 
pleasant. 

“Keep a stiff upper lip, Prebble,” I called over 
my shoulder. “Wave your hand and laugh as 



148 


Pursuit. 


we pass the count He’ll think we’re out for a 
little spin, just for the fun of the thing.” 

“He may think we’re bound for the palace,” 
said the professor, reviving. 

“He won’t think that; we’re going directly 
away from the palace.” 

“Then he can’t be coming from the palace, 
can he?” 

“No, but he may be after us, all the same. 
There! Now, hail him; laugh, and be hearty 
about it!” 

The Gount had slowed down his car, and was 
watching us with surprise and suspicion. 

“Ahoy, there, count!” I yelled, as we sped by. 
“How am I for a navigator, anyway?” 

Prebble gave a laugh, but there was not much 
heartiness in if. 

“Where are you going?” shouted the count. 

“Yes,” I roared back at him, pretending not 
to understand. Then I drew out the screen a little! 
farther. 

I could not look behind and manage the car, 
so I asked Prebble what the count was doing. 



Pursuit'. 


149 


“He’s keeping right on," returned the pro¬ 
fessor. Great Colossus!” he sputtered, aghast. 

‘‘What now?” I demanded. 

“There’s Klimon dashing along the road, cap¬ 
tain !” 

“He’ll meet the count, of course. Tell me 
whether the count stops to talk with the Chur, 
Prebble. Look alive, now!” 

“Klimon’s right in front of the official car, 
Salis! The count has got to halt, or run over 
the Chur. Klimon’s waving his hands. Ah-h-h!” 

“Well?” 

I dared not take my attention from my work 
to look behind, but had to depend on the pro¬ 
fessor to keep me informed of what was go¬ 
ing on. 

“We shall soon be pushed to the last extremity, 
captain!” cried Prebble. 

“We ought to be used to that by this time,” I 
answered grimly. 

<4 The count has stopped his car and is talking 
with Klimon.” 

“That means pursuit by a high-powered car. 
a car that can walk up on us, hand over fist. 



Pursuit. 


ISO 

“Klimon flings himself into the official car,” 
went on Prebble, “and-” 

There was nothing else for it—I couldn’t re¬ 
sist looking back. The official car was just turn¬ 
ing to head toward us as I flung the look over 
my shoulder. 

At that moment we sped over an uneven place 
in the road. I lurched wildly, and was thrown 
down on the zellin box. One of my hands was 
on the sliding screen, and as I dropped forward 
the screen was pushed home, abruptly shutting 
off the power of the cube, and bringing us to a 
slower pace so abruptly that Prebble, already, 
wabbling because of the “thank-you-ma’am,” 
went by the board precipitately. 

I had a fleeting glimpse of him standing on his 
head, heels in the air. Abandoning the professor 
was farthest.from my mind, and I jammed down 
on the brakes, and brought the car to a stand¬ 
still. 

“Prebble!” I yelled. 

He was lying sprawled out on the earth a dozen 
feet behind. As ill luck would have it, he was 
silent and inert, and apparently had met with 



Pursuit. 


ISI 

injuries which might prove serious. In the dis¬ 
tance, approaching swiftly, was the other car. 
Moments were precious, but I leaped from the 
seat, and was about to start for Prebble when 
he suddenly sat up. 

“Come on!” I shouted. “Hurry!” 

Although dazed, he was not long in picking up 
the trend of.,events. He saw the car vwith its 
lQad of warlike Churs, and scrambled to his feet 
with more haste than grace. 

“Merciful powers!” he stuttered. 

He had almost gained the car when he whirled 
and turned back. 

“What are you trying to do ?” I roared. 

Just at that moment I saw him bend and pick 
up the glittering circlet. The talk ring had 
dropped from his head during his fall and he had 
gone back after it. 

“I couldn’t understand you,” he panted, as he 
scrambled to his place in our waiting vehicle. 
“If a is the count, and b is ourselves, then 

“Never mind that!” I cut in. “Hang on, Preb¬ 
ble, for we’re going to start on the high speed ” 



152 Pursuit « 

"Very good, captain! The more peed the 
better.” 

I jerked the screen half through the slot;, and 
we shot ahead like an arrow from a bow. The 
machine was wrenched in every part, and I feared 
for a second that it would be riven to pieces. 
Happily, my fears were without foundation. The 
car held together and we flew onward like the, 
wind. 

“You’re a poor navigator, captain,” called the 
professor. 

“This is my first experience with this kind of 
a ship,” I called back to him. 

"What did you do?” 

"Tried to look behind. While I was about it,, 
the machine struck a high place in the road, and 
the power was shut off.” 

He grunted. "It’s a wonder I did not break 
my neck, captain,” said he. “I was stunned for 
an instant. When I sat up I heard you call, 
but couldn't understand what you said. The sight 
of that other car was enough, though, to remind 
me of what was going forward.” 

"We’ve lost time when we had no time to lose.” 



Pursuit. i c • 

4 We are under the heel of fortune, and must 
put up ^vith whatever comes. You should have 
shot Klimon. Had you done that, we might have 
escaped without having the official car take after 
us.” 

Dealing in such murderous fashion with even 
a Chur was not in me. Nevertheless, I could see 
now how it might have been well for us to put 
Klimon out of the way. 

“Watch the car behind, professor!” I cau¬ 
tioned. 

“I'm watching.” 

“What's going on?” 

“The Churs are getting ready to use their 
spears.” 

What the professor had said about using the 
shotgun on Klimon had given me an idea* I was 
biding only the proper moment to put it into exe¬ 
cution. 

“They'll make short work of us, captain. 9 
shrilled the professor, “if they overhaul us.” 

‘There’s small doubt of that,” I returned, be- 

tween my teeth. 

"I can see the count’s eyes flaming like live

coals. Br-r-r I This race is offering him a chance 
to even up old scores.” 

“And he’ll improve the opportunity if he can.” 

“They’re gaining, gaining!” whooped Prebble. 

It was useless for us to attempt to escape from 
the official car. It had a three-foot cube of zellin, 
equivalent to a drawing power of seventy-two. 
men. 

Our machine, on the contrary, was equipped 
with only a twenty-four-man block. Even allow¬ 
ing for the added bulk and heavy load of the 
count’s car, we were greatly outclassed. 

I opened the screen to its widest, and at times 
we seemed hardly to touch the road, so fast did 
we go. 

“Are we holding our own, Prebble!” I cried. 

“They’re still gaining,” he answered. “There 
Comes a spear!” 

“Where does it strike?” 

“Ten feet behind us.” 

Half a minute passed. 

“Another spear,” chattered Prebble, “six feet 
behind.” 

I muttered an exclamation. The count had

J 55 

gained four feet in thirty seconds, and something 
would have to he done at once. 

Prebble, I shouted, “come here and run the 
car!” 

“I can’t!” he exclaimed. 

“Yes, you can; you’ll have to!” 1 
“What are you going to do?” 

“Never mind. Time is too precious to waste 
in .talk.’’ 

On hands and knees he crept to the forward 
point of the car, and slipped into the driver’s 
seat as I vacated it. 

“You’ve steered a boat?” I asked, my lips to 
his ear. 

He nodded. 

“This steers in the same way. Keep a firm grip 
on the helm, or you’ll get a broken rib.” 

With this warning I crept back to the middle 
seat, the shotgun in my hand. The official car, 
looked like a sailless junk, loaded to the gunwale 
with pirates. 

Shields and spears bristled in the sun, and out 
of the center of the phalanx gleamed the white 
face of Count Zylox, gloomy and ominous. 



156 


Pursuit . 


“Stop!” he cried fiercely. 

I paid no attention to the word, but riveted 
my eyes on the front of the official car. Two 
Churs sat in the point, one managing the steering 
lever and the other the screen. At their feet 
between them was the large box holding the zellin 
cube. 

A quick thought plunged through my brain. I 
hesitated but a moment, and then, kneeling on the 
broad seat, I threw up the breech of the gun. 

There was a cartridge in each barrel. Throw¬ 
ing the piece to my shoulder, I took a long and 
careful aim at the zellin box. 

A spear clove the air, narrowly missing my 
head. That was my signal to pull the trigger. 

Bang! 

The recoil wrenched my shoulder, and nearly 
threw me from the seat. When the smoke lifted, 

I saw that I had worked havoc enough. 

That single charge had torn away the front 
and side of the zellin box, caused trouble with 
the steering gear, and pricked the shins of the 
Churs in the point. 

The driver and the helmsman, scared out

their wits, had hurled themselves into the road. 
The rest of their red companions followed them 
and flattened out along the ground, leaving only 
Count Zylox in the car. 

What contortions that wonderful machine went 
through! Jerked ahead by a force as of seventy- 
two Churs, the broken helm thrashing in all di¬ 
rections, it zigzagged here and there, jumped 
aloft with wheels whirring, and finally crashed 
into a tree at the roadside, and lay a complete 
wreck. 

Count Zylox, I was glad to note, had hurled 
himself from the car before the final catastrophe, 
and was suffering from nothing more than a few 
bruises. 



CHAPTER XIV. 


A TERRIFYING DENOUEMENT. 

A wail from the professor called my attention 
from the scene behind. 

“It’s gone, it's gone!” 

“What's gone?” 

“The screen cover! I drew it from the box 
to get the entire force of the cube, and the tiller 
jammed sideways and knocked it out of my 
hand.” 

I was angry, for this carelessness of the pro¬ 
fessor's was like to cost us dear We were not 
pursued, it is true, but our car was running away 
with us. 

The only power we had over it was to guide 
it a little to right and left. We could not stop 
or diminish the speed. 

Our gait was that of the Empire State Express, 
and the track before us had suddenly widened 
into all outdoors. Where we had left the road 
I do not know, but we were racing across a 
broad plain, hot, sandy, level as a floor. 



A Terrifying Denouement . 


159 


There were no houses, no trees, no rocks— 
nothing to impede our progress. This was well, 
considering our limited ability in handling the 
oyd car. 

I peered ahead. In the distance there rose 
from the earth a cloud!ike haze, funnel-shaped, 
and resembling the swirling vortex of a cyclone. 

What was it? I had no time to debate the 
question, even had I been so disposed. 

“The wall! The wall!” shrieked Prebble. 

Yes, there was the great wall built to hem in 
the Churs. It stretched across the plain as far 
as the eye could see, and appeared to encircle 
the column of smoke, or dust, or whatever it was. 

As we charged toward it, and it came plainer 
and plainer into view, I concluded that it must 
be at least thirty feet in height, of solid masonry, 
pierced with one brazen gate, toward which we 
vere heading. 

The gate, twenty feet wide, and twenty high, 
looked forbidding enough, but better a collision 
with that than with the granite wall. 

“Fort your helm, Prebble!” I shouted. Port! 

As he moved the tiller I saw a score of the led 



T JO 


A Terrifying Denouement, 


fiends silhouetted on top of the wall. They were 
looking at us, whooping, dancing, and beating 
their spears against their shields. 

Prebble began a pater noster, but I cut him 
short with the remaining barrel of the shotgun, 
fired into the air. The Churs melted from the 
wall as if by magic. 

“You see!” I shouted triumphantly. “This gun 
is going to do the business for us, Prebble/’ 

“That wall is going to do the business,” he 
flung back. 

“We’re heading for the gate!” I answered. 

“Do you think we can smash open the gate 
and ride through the land of the Churs straight 
to the pole?” he retorted grimly. “Make your 
peace with Heaven, Salis! There’ll be a smash-up 
in less than a minute.” 

“We’ve got to jump,” said I, as calmly as 
possible. “Better to jump than have our lives 
battered out against the gate.” 

While speaking, I threw out the bag of pemmi- 
can and ship’s biscuit. The bag struck the ground, 
sprang twenty feet into the air, and fell again in 
a shower of sand. 



A Terrifying Denouement. 161 

"And we’ve got to go through that!” cried the 
professor. "There’ll not be a whole bone left 
in our bodies.” 

"Jump!” I shouted. “Follow me !” 

Out I went, shotgun in hand. When I came 
down I must have turned a dozen somersaults. 

The gun left my hands, and the talk ring my 
head. I ripped my toga to rags, and would have 
lost it utterly had not the cartridge belt held its 
remnants about my waist. 

After a second or two I realized that I was 
sitting on the sand, watching a figure fly upward 
from the point of the oyd car, squirm through 
the air, drop, and ricochet along the ground, 
halting at last, a mere heap of humanity, in a 
wrecked tunic. 

Was the professor dead or alive? As I picked 
myself up painfully to go forward and investi¬ 
gate, a crashing sound reached me from the gate. 

Looking toward that point, I noted with won¬ 
der that the barrier had not withstood the impact 
of the zellin cube. The gate was ajar, various 
pieces of the oyd car piled in the opening. 

Prebble was on his feet before I reached him. 



162 A Terrifying Denouement 

He still wore his buskins, and was frantically 
engaged in tying the remains of the tunic about 
his waist. 

“Yes,” he cried angrily, “you would come 
north, captain! Reason, circumstances, every¬ 
thing pointed south. But, no, you would go north 
or nowhere. And now look at us!” 

He picked up his talk ring and jammed it down 
on his head. 

He said something else, but as he was talking 
Nyll and I was'listening in English, the sense 
of it was lost upon me. It was clear to me that 
he was not very seriously hurt, and I went back 
for my own talk ring and the gun. 

The professor was sorely out of patience with 
everybody and everything. He had had two falls 
from the oyd car, and the first one alone would 
have soured his temper but for the excitement 
attending the pursuit. This second fall was far 
more dangerous and annoying than the first, and 
I could not blame him for displaying some ran¬ 
cor. 

“What’s to become of us, Salis ?” the professor 



A Terrifying Denouement . 


163 

demanded, surveying me as though he consid¬ 
ered our salvation my part of the work. 

“I can tell you better about that in a few min¬ 
utes/' I answered. 

I was dizzy in brain and weak in the legs. The 
only way I could hold myself upright was by 
leaning on the shotgun. 

“If it isn't one thing it's two," scowled Preb- 
ble. “How are we to get out of this?" 

“I wish I knew! It strikes me, though, that 
the farther we can get away from that smashed 
gate the better it will be for us. Come on, Preb- 
ble!" 

I reeled to an about face, and began staggering 
off along the wall. Prebble shouted an angry 
protest, and I turned to discover that he had 
plumped himself down in the sand. 

“How do you think I can move?" he groaned. 
“Every joint in my body is unhinged. Look 
where I lit," and he pointed to a gouged-out spot 
in the earth. “No man could hit the ground like 
that without being half killed." 

“If we linger here until the Churs come out," 
said I, “they'll finish the job." 



164 


A Terrifying Denouement . 


“I’m willing,” he declared resignedly. “I’ve 
had quantum sufficit. Being flesh and blood, and 
not whalebone and India rubber, my body tells 
me when I have borne hardships to the limit of 
endurance. If you’re bound to go on, Salis, good- 
by! It is impossible for me to accompany you.” 

“Buck up!” I answered. 

“I wish I could, but I can’t.” 

“Here, let me help you.” 

“I decline to be interfered with! I want to 
stay right here so that the Churs can have a good 
chance at me. Why are they hanging back? 
Why don’t they show themselves?” 

I looked toward the broken gate. The oyd car 
was heaped fantastically in the middle of it, but 
there was no sign of Churs to be seen. 

“The roar of the gun has frightened them,” I 
explained. 

“It couldn’t frighten all the Churs, but only 
those who were on the wall. Where are the 

rest?” 

“I’m not theorizing about the rest. It’s the 
present situation that concerns me.” 

“Remember what happened at the lake when 



A Terrifying Denouement 1O5 

that revolver was fired. Those who heard the 
report dropped prone on their faces, but those 
who didn’t hear the report refused to be awed 
by the description the others gave of it. There 11 
be a smother of the hairy demons ail around us 
before long. Some messenger has revived and 
gone after them/’ 

The professor’s voice was hopeful. Tie ap¬ 
peared to be honestly glad that our misadventures 
were soon to be terminated. 

His voice was strong and robust. From that 
I gathered that he was not so severely injured 
as he was trying to make me believe. 

“Let me lift you to your feet, professor,” I sug¬ 
gested, ‘'and then I can support you while w r e 
make our escape.” 

He stared at me blankly. 

“Escape?” he echoed. “W hy do you talk about 
such a thing? Where are we to escape to? Is 
there any haven of refuge in all this region for 
you and me? If we go back, the Nyllites will 
catch f us; if we go forward, then we fall into 
the hands of the Churs. There’s not a spot in alj 
this benighted country where we can call our- 



i66

selves safe. We should have gone south, in the 
direction of the ice wall.” 

I saw that I must reason with my companion 
and get him back into a normal state of mind. 

‘Til admit, professor,” said I, “that our situa¬ 
tion seems hopeless; but has it not seemed equally 
hopeless several times before this? And haven't 
we always managed to slip through the gathering 
dangers ?” 

“There’s got to be a first time, captain, when 
we fail to slip through,” he answered, shaking his 
head forebodingly. “Personally, I think we have 
come to that time.” 

“I had hoped,” I went on, taking another tack, 
“that you would live to give to. the world your 
proof 'regarding the meteoric theory of the 
aurora. Possibly there is more glory in that, 
for you, than for me in discovering the pole.” 

“That’s what I dislike about this Chur busi¬ 
ness,” said he, a flash of pride crossing his dusty, 
face. “That’s proof,” he added fondly, “which 
scientific men cannot dodge. They’ll have to be¬ 
lieve it! I intend to write a book that will place 
my name high on the scroll of fame.” He got 



A Terrifying Denouement. 


167 


up quite briskly while he was talking. “I am ab¬ 
solutely certain that my word is the very last 
on this meteoric theory of the aurora. From that 
ipse dixit there is no escape.” 

“Right you are!” I cried enthusiastically. “Sup¬ 
pose we stroll off along the wall and see what 
We can discover!” 

He leaned on me for a space while he adjusted 
his glasses. 

“I ought to feel grateful to you, captain/’ he 
maundered, “for giving me the chance to settle a 
question which has bothered scientific minds for 
years. I am grateful, believe me!” 

“How are you feeling?” I asked solicitously. 

“Better. I am not so much of a wreck as I 
had imagined. There are no fractures Natu¬ 
rally, my dignity has suffered somewhat, but 

I-” 

His voice trailed off into silence, for just at 
that moment an army of Churs had begun fairly 
to boil out of the gate in the wall. 

These were not the ones who had heard the 
terrifying report of the shotgun and dropped 



A Terrlfying . Denouement. 


168 

from the wall a short time before, but others, un¬ 
daunted, and eager to fall upon us. 

With fierce yells and spears clashing against 
shields, they literally swarmed in our direction. 

“Quick!” panted Prebble. “The gun—the 
gun!” 

I threw up the breech and the empty shells were 
automatically ejected. Then I plucked from the 
belt one of the few cartridges that had remained 
in it after my tumble from the car. 

I pressed the shell to the breech. The next 
moment it is possible I swore, for I am a sailor, 
and the provocation was great. 

“What?” faltered Prebble whisperingly, 
“Oh-h-h, what ncnv?” 

I looked at him with dilated eyes. 

“These shells,” I replied hoarsely, “are too 
large! I can't get them into the gun! Griffyn 
must have had two shotguns—we got the belt 
that goes with the other weapon!” 

The professor tossed his arms and fell to the 
ground. I stood over him, the muzzle of the gun 
in my hands, sweeping a circle about me with 
the stock. 



A Terrifying Denouement. 


169 


I forget how many of those rabid Churs I 
mowed down with the clubbed firearm. I can 
only remember that we were taken, tied together 
with thongs, and driven beyond the great wall, 
spear points pricking us at every step. 



CHAPTER XV. 


PRISONERS. 

Prebble and. I had been on tenterhooks ever 
since our arrival in this circumpolar region, but 
we had not faced a more desperate situation than 
the one that now confronted us. Personally, I 
would not have giveji a copper cent for our 
chances. 

My learned companion, as was so often the case 
with him, was lost in contemplation of our strange 
surroundings, to the exclusion of the animal in¬ 
stinct of fear. His mind was grappling with 
scientific data, and was therefore too busy to 
consider our perils. 

“Here,” I heard him mutter, “we see the "hu¬ 
man faculties emerging through their chrysalis 
of brutality; primordial, obscure, but very pro¬ 
nounced nevertheless. How these heads and 
these faces would delight a Lombroso! There 
are no other savages in the world like these! If 
I could abduct one of the creatures, and take it

171 

back to our own country, what a stir would be 
caused in the scientific world!*’ 

“Unless I am greatly mistaken, professor,” I 
observed dryly, “you will have a splendid chance 
to study these interesting savages at close quar¬ 
ters;; 

“I hope so, I do indeed!” he answered absently, 
and was off again with his mumbling. “How do 
they live? What do they eat? Are they monog¬ 
amous? Do they have villages? That prog¬ 
nathous visage predicates cruelty and determina¬ 
tion. Ah, very absorbing, very!” 

“I don’t see anything in the nature of tilled 
fields, professor,” said I. 

He lifted his bowed head, and became suddenly 
aware that I was marching at his side. 

“No, captain,” he returned, in an attempt to be 
sociable, “these savages are not agricultural. In 
one way or another, most savages are found to 
take a certain toll from Mother Earth, and I pre¬ 
sume that these Churs must raise something in 
the nature of food, even though none of their 
fields are in evidence. The arts o ! the husoand- 
man are very primitive in origin. Admit ation

filled his face as he bent his gaze on a tail savage 
marching just ahead of him. “What perfect 
physical development!” he exclaimed. 

“I can see little in these hairy scoundrels,” said 
I testily, “but vast powers for evil. They are 
mere brutes—at the bottom of the scale, while the 
Nyllites are at the top.” 

“The Nyllites symbolize the. mind, even as 
these Churs are symbolical of the matter,” re¬ 
marked Prebble. “The brilliant mentality of the 
Nyll kingdom reaches here for its physical power, 
takes it by sheer force of the will, humbles it and 
shapes it to various uses. Where could you hap¬ 
pen upon a finer commentary on the power of 
mind over matter?” 

“You are getting in too deep for me, profes¬ 
sor,” said I. “T11 warrant you, however, that if 
these Churs only realized their power, they could 
overrun the Kingdom of Nyll and lay it waste.” 

The professor shuddered. 

“What a catastrophe that would be!” he mur¬ 
mured. “Think of the gorgeous palaces, the 
beautiful gardens, the wondrous inventions ajid 
discoveries of Nyll all lying under the strangling 



Prisoners. 173 

hands of these brutes! Such a calamity is too 
monstrous, captain. It could never happen.” 

“What caused the downfall of the Roman'Em¬ 
pire?” I asked. 

“Luxury, effiminacy, too much wealth and 
power. All the empire became drunk with pros¬ 
perity.” 

‘‘And, as a result, the Roman eagle had its neck 
wrung, and was cast to the vultures. Am I 
right?” 

“You express it very tersely, captain. 

“Doesn’t Nyll strike you as being much in the 
same way?” 

He threw me a startled look. 

“At times, captain,” said he, “you uncover a 
rich vein of thought that strikes into profound 
depths. Yes, you are right. Nyll bases its 
power upon faculties of the mind that have been 
most astonishingly developed. If anything were 
to becloud those powers, the whole kingdom 
would be pillaged by these brutes, who are now 
confined within the great wall. The possibility is 
terrible to contemplate, and it quite unnerves me. 
But Nyllites are not exact replicas of the ancient 



174 


Prisoners. 


Romans. Although a land of idleness, the other 
kingdom is not 'lapped in sensuous ease/ Our 
experiences with the Nyllites have not been 
pleasant, yet we must grant them their due. I 
know personally that labors of the mind are more 
exhausting than labors of the body/’ 

The professor was intensely interested in our 
captors. Without the wall, he had been willing 
to bide in hopelessness while the Churs sallied 
forth and dispatched him; but now he was in an¬ 
other mood. 

"You realize, I suppose/’ said I grimly, "that 
we are prisoners?’* 

“These ropes that bind my arms at my back,” 
he replied, “serve to remind me of that fact, cap¬ 
tain.” 

"Do you also realize that we may be doomed 
to death ?” 

“That is quite possible,” he returned gravely, 
"but I hope they will spare us long enough so 
that I may make some inquiries regarding their 
mode of life. An examination into their tribal 
customs, their language, the limitations of their 
intellect and their ways of war would be highly

1 75 

diverting. They are but a step above,, the beasts 
of the forest, and may prove to be the true Miss¬ 
is? Link that unites man to the lower orders of 
creation. If we could take one of them back 
with us, captain-” 

“We have no visible means for getting our¬ 
selves away to our own country,” I broke in, 
so let us say nothing- of burdening our return 
with savages like these.” 

He saw that I was out of sympathy with his 
aspirations, and I saw plainly that he was in a 
trancelike condition where his scientific knowl¬ 
edge was wrestling with recondite enigmas to the 
complete exclusion of his present unhappy state. 

I watched the Churs, striding swiftly along 
and forcing us to hurry in their midst. Their 
faces reflected a purpose which was ominous, and 
aroused disagreeable thoughts of what was to 
happen to the professor and me. 

There was nothing to be done, however, ex¬ 
cept to submit passively and face the end with 
fortitude. Something might happen to make the 
end more pleasant than the present situation 
promised. 



i/6 


Prisoners* 


I saw no buildings, nothing in the way of 
shelter even of the rudest description.. There 
were no evidences of art and craft beyond the 
shields and the spears. These were well-made 
weapons of offense and defense, but suggested 
nothing more than war and savagery. I lis¬ 
tened to the professor discoursing to himself: 

“The facial angle, retreating from the prog¬ 
nathous jaws to the low forehead, prove these 
Churs to be bestial. They are cruel, merciless, 
superstitious—primitive children, as yet un¬ 
touched; by the faintest ray of real knowledge.” 

Thus he mumbled, scarcely heeding the spear 
that accelerated his lagging pace. I also took no¬ 
tice of many things, but only in a perfunctory 
and general way. 

For instance, in passing through the gate, I 
judged the wall of masonry to be twenty feet in 
thickness; I saw that the land of the Churs was 
ridged with rocky hills, for the most part bar¬ 
ren; I felt the earth to be uncomfortably warm 
under my feet, and when we waded a small 
stream, the water was hot to my flesh. 

In the distance that column of cloudlike vapor

trailed skyward, bending- and twisting at the crest, 
and spreading out so that the sun resembled a 
fiery ball in a drifting shroud. On and on we 
walked/until we turned into a defile among the 
gaunt rocks. 

Spears struck shields in a ringing clamor, and, 
presto, the bowlders spewed out a perfect mob of 
unkempt creatures, who ran toward us, some 
erect and some on all fours. 

'Women and children/’ droned Prebble; "very 
curious, very. Evidently these creatures are cave 
dwellers; possibly survivors of the Stone Age, 
and, as such, our progenitors. I should like their 
measurements on the Bertillon system.” 

The women and children surveyed us in awe. 
The professor, however, claimed most of their 
attention, their eyes being focused on his head 
and spectacles—the spectacles and buskins being 
about all that remained to him of his former 
state. 

We were goaded into a vile-smelling hole in 
the rocky hillside, and were made to sit down 
while our feet were pinioned. Then, peifectly 
helpless, we were left to our own devices. 



x 7 8 


Prisoners . 


One of the Churs—so tall that he stood head 
and shoulders above the rest—barked out a series 
of orders. Immediately the creatures scattered, 
women and children with the rest, and began 
fetching armfuls of dry wood and throwing it 
down in a heap. 

While this^was going forward, other Churs 
arrived. Tw r o carried the shotgun across their 
spears in front of them, not daring to touch it 
with their hands. 

Four, with spears elevated, had our bag of 
pemmican and ship’s biscuit on the spear points. 
That, also, I suppose, was a fetich, and to b$ 
handled warily. 

Lastly came a train of grizzled warriors, each 
with a lost cartridge on the flat of his spear head. 
These were thrown in a heap beside the gun and 
bag of food. 

“We’re in for it,” I muttered gloomily. “Don’t 
you think so, Prebble ?” 

“Monosyllabic,” he answered absently. 

“What?” I queried. 

He gave a start. 

“Their speech, captain, is of the one-syllabtf

179 

variety; that is, rudimentary. Now, the ancient 
Aryans-” 

“Belay!” I interrupted, out of temper. “I 
want none of your homilies now. We have plenty 
of food for thought of a different kind.” 

“Yes, yes,” he answered eagerly; “I should call 
it homonymous, or, rather- 

I lurched against him and brought him out of 
his vagary. 

“Eh!” he exclaimed. “Did you say something, 
captain?” 

“Look out there!” I answered brutally. “Lord 
Nylis said these creatures were cannibals, and 
they appear to be collecting wood. There’s a 
chain of reasoning to claim your immediate at¬ 
tention.” 

“You think-” The professor grew pallid. 

“I don’t think,” I answered, “I know!” 

He pressed his clawlike hands together, bound 
as they were. 



CHAPTER XVI. 


A TRYING ORDEAL. 

At last the professor was completely en rapport 
.with our desperate situation. 

'The world will lose my demonstration of the 
meteoric theory/’ he cried bitterly, "and you,. 
Salis, are the cause. Outside the wall you of¬ 
fered hope. Hope! And look at us now! Upon 
your head, sir, will fall the consequences.” 

“I guess we’re both in for the consequences,” I 
returned. “By the mizzentruck of the great 
Harry!” I added, looking toward the wood gath¬ 
erers ; “there’s a Nyllite!’ 

“A prisoner?” asked Prebble. 

“No; he acts as though he had some authority 
among them.” 

“Strange!” muttered my companion, his eyes 
on the man. “He wears the skin of a wild beast, 
like the Churs, and there is not the same intelli¬ 
gence shown in his face as in the faces of others 
of his race. Here comes the tall man; he’s a 
chief, I suppose.” 



A Trying Ordeal. 


i8r 


The leader of the pack made toward the cave, 
followed by four others. 

“They’re ready for us, I take it,” said I, trying 
to speak calmly. 

“I beg your pardon, captain," said Prebble. 

“For what?” 

“For accusing you of leading me into this pre¬ 
dicament. It has just flashed over me that we 

0 

could not have gone south if we had wanted to." 

“I thought it would come to you,” I answered. 

“We will meet our fate shoulder to shoulder,” 
he went on. "It’s not death that terrifies me; 
it’s—it’s what follows, in this case." 

I laid my bound hands against his, which was 
as near a handshake as we could come. We dif¬ 
fered often, Prebble and I, for we were two of 
diverse natures; yet 1 never doubted his innate 
manhood nor do I think he ever doubted mine. 

There was something incongruous in Preb- 
ble’s remark, just made, when compared with 
other remarks, remembered by me, of which he 
had relieved himself while we were on the ice cap. 
But I have yet to -find a man who is, at all. times*

18 2 

perfectly consistent. Surely no scientific man 
Can lay claim to such an honor. 

Through the opening of our cave we watched 
the tall man and the four others. Suddenly the 
tall man came to a halt, grouped the v four around 
him, and began a harangue. The guttural voice 
was pitched so low that we could not distinguish 
anything except husky syllables and staccato 
pauses between them. 

"They are devising ways and means, I sup¬ 
pose?” said the professor. 

"One supposition is as good as another,” I 
answered. "It all comes to one thing in the 
end.” 

"This is a bad dream, an exceedingly disagree¬ 
able dream.” 

"You still cling to that riotion, do you?” 

"Why not, if it pleases me? All life, my dear 
captain, is a dream. At least, so my fancy runs. 
An immortal falls asleep in Elysium, and what 
he dreams is a human life. Sometimes his dream 
is short, and sometimes long; sometimes it is sad 
and hitter, and sometimes full of happiness and 
hopes realized. But the immortal wakes, whether 



A Trying Ordeal L 


183 

his dream is bright or dull, and again he discovers 
himself in Elysium; and he realizes that he has 
been in Elysium all the time/’ 

With my eyes on the gabbling Churs, I gave 
rather deep attention to this odd conceit of Preb- 
ble’s. I had never suspected that he had a vein 
of poetry in his make-up. 

“Very pretty,” said I, “and, what is better 
and more to the point, there may be a little truth 
in it. But Elysium must be full of sleepers/’ 

He muttered a few words under his breath, and 
I feared he was tinkering up another equation. 
But, no. Presently he lifted his head, removed 
his spectacles, and began cleaning them on a rag 
of his tunic* 

At that moment, the chief came on with his 
four Churs, and the professor came to a pause. 

The Chur chieftain unbound our ankles and 
motioned to us to rise. We obeyed, and walked 
out among the ragged rabble that surrounded the 
pyre. 

There we were cut asunder, and the professoi 
was led aside and made to seat himself on a bear-

skin. After this, the Nyllite stepped in front 
of me. 

“You are from Nyll?” he asked. 

“Recently/’ I answered. 

“Where from originally? There are no'black¬ 
haired men in Nyll, and no hairless men like the 
one yonder.” 

He turned and indicated Prebble. 

“We come from beyond the ice wall. Who 
are you, if I may inquire?” 

“Sertez, I am called. Banished from Nyll by 
King Boazar on the morning of the long day. 
Banished,” he added acrimoniously, “because I 
dared to make love to the Princess Ylma.” 

He struck a note that made my hearstrings vi- 
btate. I eyed him keenly. 

“Princess Ylma would not receive your ad¬ 
vances ?” I queried. 

“No,” he answered, “but that is nothing. She 
does not know her own mind. Apart from that, 
however, she is promised to a man she hates.” 
“Who?” 

“To Count Zylox, captain of the king’s guard” 



A Trying Ordeal 


185 

At last I knew why his lordship felt pity for 
Princess Ylma. 

"Why will the king force her to a marriage 
against her will?” I proceeded, feigning care¬ 
lessness. 

“Because Zylox is head of the house of Almik, 
rivals of the Boazars. On his death the kine 
fears Ylma will be set aside in favor of Zylox, 
and he wishes to unite the two houses/’ 

Sertez turned and shook his clenched fist south¬ 
ward. 

“I bide my time!” he hissed. ‘‘Some day I 
shall lead a horde of Churs into Nyll and steal 
the princess.” 

The next moment he shrugged his shoulders 
and tossed his hands deprecatingly. 

“But enough of this. I suppose you know the 
fate for which you are intended?” 

“I can imagine what it is to be. Have you any 
power among these people ? Can you not per¬ 
suade them to give over their horrible designs? 

He shook his head. 

“Your companion will be spared,” said he. 
!‘He is taboo among the Churs because of his 



x86 


A Trying Ordeal 


hairless head. We can none of us understand 
the reason; and what we cannot understand'we 
believe to be supernatural.” 

I laughed bitterly at the inconsistency of the 
Churs. The professor would live. He might 
never be able to return to our own country, but 
his bald pate saved him from the disaster that 
threatened me. 

I was near the shotgun, the small heap of car¬ 
tridges, and the food bag. My despondent eyes 
fell upon them, and I noticed something, small 
in itself, but of great importance just then. 

Thp cartridges differed in size! Had there 
been two sizes of loaded shells in the belt? And 
had I, in my haste at the great wall, plucked out 
one of the larger shells ? 

( T will ask you,” said I to the Nyllite, - “to take 
this cord from my wrists.” 

“You cannot escape,” said he. 

“Therefore, the less reason for you to hesitate 
in granting my request.” 

He removed the bonds. Instantly I picked up 
tiie shotgun, threw up the breech, and tried one 
of the smaller shells. 



A Trying Ordeal . 


187 

I tremble even now to think of that agonizing 
moment. Would it fit, or had I tried the smaller 
kind just without the Wall? 

The shell slid into the barrel, and I snapped the 
breech back into place. 

“Glory!” shouted Prebble, leaping to his feet 
and waving frantically the bearskin on which he 
had been sitting. 

He performed a dance, bizarre enough consid¬ 
ering his regalia. The Churs, thinking I was 
about to make some attempt at escape, began 
closing in on me with savage cries and ferocious 
gestures. 

I fired the single barrel into the air, and stood 
quietly under the smoke wreath, noting the ef¬ 
fect. The result was all that I had dared to 
hope. 

Down went the Churs, even Sertez sinking to 
one knee. Silence followed, disturbed only by 
the gabbling^ old professor, who, not knowing 
his bald hedd had saved him, believed the gun had 
proved the salvation of both of us. 

Presently the chief got up on his hands and 
knees, crawled to my feet, and lifted a handful 



188 


A Trying Ordeal, 


of sand, and threw it over his head. Then he 
rose and yelped at the rest, of his hairy followers. 

Immediately a long line of the creatures began 
creeping past me, every one of them performing 
the same operation. 

“What is the meaning of this, Sertez?” I in¬ 
quired. 

“As long as you remain on earth, O Thunder 
Maker,” returned the > Nyllite fulsomely, “you 
and your companion are the honored guests of 
the pack! Koz, the chieftain, tenders his abject- 
apologies for the manner in which you have been 
treated. 

“Those on the wall prior to the breaking of the 
gate averred stoutly that you were the Thunder 
Maker, but Koz would not believe. Now that 
he has heard with his own ears, and seen with 
his own eyes, he declares that he and his pack 
will be your slaves until you depart from the 
land.” 

Tis well,” I answered; with digfiity. “Tell 
Koz that we are put out somewhat at the-manner 
of our reception, but that we harbor no ill will.’* 

“He shall be informed.” 



A Trying Ordeal 


189 

“I also wish you to tell him,” I continued, “that 
I and my companion are merely human, like the 
Nyllites. But we have power to requite evil for 
evil and good for good." 

‘There is no such word as ‘good’ in the Chur 
language.” 

“Then repeat the substance of my remarks in 
your, own way.” 

Chief Koz, leader of the pack, seemed over¬ 
joyed when my words were translated by Sertez 
for.his benefit. From condemned strangers we 
rose at one leap to the rank of honored guests. 

The best cave in the hills was placed at our 
disposal, and two of the chief’s sons were told off 
to serve us. 

One of our first acts w T as to send for the bag 
of pem$nican and biscuit, and to fortify ourselves 
with a hearty meal against other emergencies 
which we knew would be sure to arise. 



CHAPTER XVIL 


SERTEZ, THE RENEGADE. 

Soon after we had finished our meal, Sertez 
looked in on us for a little chat. Prebble and I 
had just been discussing Sertez. 

He was, by his own admission, a banished man; 
but I regarded him in the light of a renegade. 
f He had said Princess Ylma did not like him—for 
which I commended her warmly—and that, in 
the face of this, it was his desire to abduct her. 

No gentleman would express himself in such 
a manner. Prebble was of one mind with me, 
but advised that we tolerate the fellow because 
of his value to us in our dealings with the. Churs. 

So, when Sertez crept through the low en¬ 
trance into our cave and then got up and ad¬ 
vanced into the glare of the torch that lighted 
the interior, we welcomed him civilly. 

He remarked upon the head room to be had 
In oiir quarters, saying it was the only cave in 
the district where a man could stand upright* 
without fear of knocking otit his brains. 



Sertez, the Renegade . ^ 

He lolled on a bearskin, and we presented him 
with a bit of pemmican and a ship’s biscuit, both 
of which he appeared to relish. 

I should think, said I, that if the Churs can 
climb to the top of the great wall on one side they 
could drop over on the other.” 

“So they could,” he answered, “but there is 
no need of any climbing. You gentlemen have 
demolished the gate, and it is now possible to 
walk through with perfect ease.” 

“Then why don’t they do it?” struck in Preb- 
ble. “From the little I have seen of both coun¬ 
tries, Nyll is far preferable to this.” 

“The Churs are cowed by the superiority of 
the Nyllites,” said Sertez. “With one look a 
Nyllite can make a Chur drop his spear and run 
howling back to his wilderness.” 

“Then , how can you ever hope to make a raid 
into the other country?” I asked. 

“I have been waiting for King Boazar and 
the Almiks to come to daggers drawn. But now 
I have another plan. I propose to cooperate with 
you.” 

“In what way?” 



192 


Sertez, the Renegade . 


“You seem to be possessed of wonderful pow¬ 
ers,” Sertez proceeded audaciously, “and if you 
could by some means blight the minds of the Nyll- 
ites, the Churs would immediately- overrun their 
country and I could get the princess.” 

The shotgun was within reach, and I put out 
my hand toward it. Prebble halted me With a 
look. 

“That is out of our power,” said he. 

Disappointment overspread the villainous face 
of Sertez. 

“There is no way you can help me?” he queried. 

“No,” I replied shortly. 

“What is the extent of the Chur possession®?” 
asked the professor, at his old trade of delving 
for facts. 

“Twenty miles from’.wall--to wall.” 

“And what causes that pillar of smoke which 
,we see to the north?” 

Sertez looked surprised. 

“I supposed everybody knew that,” said he. 
“The earth, grinding around its great spindle, 
causes, much heat, so that smoke and minutepar- 
ticles of dust arise and mingle with the clouds.” 



Scrtcz, tie lie :u\j tide.

After a 


The professor grabbed at his head, 
moment he continued: 

“What is the diameter of the North Pole?” 

“One-half a geographical mile.” 

“Round on top?” 

“No, flat—flat as a floor. The Great Ziff lives 
there.” 

“Who under the canopy is the Great Ziff?” I 
demanded. 

Again the surprised look filtered across Ser- 
tez’s face. 

“Your ignorance astonishes me!” he exclaimed. 
“The Great Ziff, gentlemen, is head chief of all 
the packs. When the time comes to raid the land 
of the Nyllites, he w ill head the packs in person.” 

“He is a warrior of prowess?” 

“He is invincible in combat, a veritable lion. 
But the eyes of the Nyllites are too much for 
him, as for the rest of his followers. There 
are some peculiar things about the Great Ziff, 
gentlemen. For instance, he is not subject to the 
influence of time. He has lived many thousands 
of years, and will, no doubt, last as long as the 
earth endures.” 



Ip4 Sertez , the Renegade. 

I saw a grin forming about the professor’s thin 
lips. 

“How do you account for this—er—remarka¬ 
ble longevity?” 

“Very easily. What, makes time? Days, of 
course; the succession of light and darkness. 
What makes days ? The rotation of the earth on 
its axis. The Great Ziff lives on the end of the 
axis and doesn’t rotate. Therefore, he is not 
subject to the influence of time.’’ 

The professor reached for the gun this time, 
but I grabbed jt from him. 

“Sophistry!” he cried. “The rotation of the 
earth, as you s^y, makes what we call a day; 
but neither days., nor months, nor years make 
time. They are but way stations on the eternal 
path.” 

“When you have been longer in the country 
you will know more about it,” was Sertez’s un¬ 
ruffled rejoinder. 

Prebble grew red in the face, and onl;y suc¬ 
ceeded in calming himself after a great effort. 

“How far is the North Pole from here?” I 
asked.

Sertez, the Renegade . 

“An hour’s journey.” 

“I am anxious to pay my respects to the Great 

Ziff-” 

“Impossible!” 

“Why impossible?” 

“At a distance of fifty feet from the pole the 
terrific heat would scorch you to a cinder/'’ 

“How does the Great Ziff get on and off the 
pole?” 

“He rarely gets off. As for getting on, he 
was there when the earth began to rotate.” 

“Nonsense!” whooped the professor. 

“The longer you stay the more you’ll know,” 
said Sertez laconically. 

“If the Great Ziff leads his subjects on their 
raid into the land of Nyll,” I put in, “hell have 
to get off the pole, won’t he?” 

“He will,” answered Sertez. “When ready, 
he’ll come. .Fire has no effect on him, and that 
is another of his peculiarities. It is said he is 
very fond of blue fire. He is served by little 
boys in red caps-” 

“What folly is the man talking!” exclaimed the 
disgusted professor.

“And by monsters all head and no tail,” con¬ 
tinued Sertez, “and by hideous, slimy things that 
creep on the earth and slide through the aif, and 

by—’ 

“Hold!” ordered Prebble. “We have enough 
of that. We’re after facts, not fancies.” 

“The longer you’re with us, the more-” 

“Yes, yes, you said that before.” 

“The Churs believe these things about the 
Great Ziff.” 

“About what I would expect of their primitive 
minds,” sniffed the professor. 

“They run to physical, rather than to mental, 
power,” said Sertez, rising. “If I can be of as¬ 
sistance to you. at any time, gentlemen,” he added, 
“do not fail to call on me.” Thereupon he crawled 
out on all fours, as he had crawled in. 

“There goes the biggest-” began the pro¬ 

fessor, but paused abruptly. “No,” he went on, 
“I won’t say it. What he tells is hardly more in¬ 
credible than the things we have seen with our 
own eyes since reaching these circumpolar re¬ 
gions. 

“If we were to put our experiences down in

black and white for the benefit of our fellow, 
countrymen, captain, they would call us monu¬ 
mental—I refrain again. The term grates on a 
sensitive ear.” 

“Truth is stranger than fiction ever dared to 
be,” said I sagely. 

A few minutes later, accompanied by our serv¬ 
itors Bigoll and Xit, we emerged from our cav¬ 
ern and started for the pole. Our den opened on 
a rocky defile, with steep sides, which it was 
necessary for us to traverse. 

At the end of the defile we came upon a group 
of warriors who, grinning behind their couched 
spears, disputed our advance. I motioned them 
aside, but they would not stir. 

We looked around for Sertez, thinking to make 
our wishes known through him. He was not in 
sight, however. 

As a last resort, I fired the gun. Ihe Cnurs 
quaked in their tracks, but did not fall, as had 
heretofore been their invariable custom. 

“Let’s try the other end oi the defile,” said the 

professor. 

We did, and were met by more of the Churs, 



198 Sertez f the Renegade. 

who blockaded us as effectually as the others had 
done. 

“We are honored guests, with a vengeance,” 
I fumed. “What does this mean, anyway?” 

“It means,” replied the professor, “that they 
prize our company so highly they can’t let us go. 
We must return to the cave.” 

This we did, and for one hundred and sixty- 
eight hours—which would have been seven days 
in a country where night and day recur in ac¬ 
cepted order—we slept, ate, conversed, and made 
essays to begin our journey poleward. But we 
were unable to leave the defile. 

The outlook was discouraging. Sertez kept 
himself in the background the whole time, and 
whenever we questioned Bigoll and Xit, by signs, 
to tell us about him, they shook their heads and 
grinned blankly. 

Finally, in the hundred and sixty-eighth hour, 
Sertez materialized. He brought with him a sil¬ 
ver box. 

“You told us to call on you,” said I, with some 
heat, “whenever we desired your services.” 

“I am here, gentlemen,” he answered blandly* 



Sertez, the Renegade.

“Where have you oeen?” 

“Abroad, in the land of the Churs, organizing 
and preparing for the coming of the Great Ziff.’’ 

1 noiiced that he was highly pleased over some¬ 
thing, and repressed his jubilant feelings with 
diincuhy. 

What s on foot?” I asked. 

“A messenger, one of the Churs, has come 
from the land of Boazar. He says the blight has 
fallen, and that the mental powers of the Xyllites 
are dethroned. They have become gibbering 
idiots, doddering fools! 

“And now, now the accepted time approaches. 
You do not believe in the Great Ziff. But you 
shall see him come in a cloud of blue fire, with 
the little boys in red caps, and monsters all head 
and no tail, and hideous things that creep on earth 
and slide through air. You shall witness the 
gathering of the packs under the Great Ziff, and 
then, if you follow, you shall observe the over¬ 
throw of the Nyllites and behold Sertez and 
Princess Ylma united and holding sway under 
protection of the high chief of the Churs!

He drew a picture which horrified me. For 
the moment Prebble was dumb. 

Sertez laughed diabolically, and handed me the 
silver box and a little golden ke^. 

“For you/’ said he; “the messenger brought 
it. He said it was for the stranger with the 
black hair and eyes.” 

I was all agog with curiosity. And so was 
Prebble, for that matter. ' Both he and Sertez 
watched eagerly while I unlocked the casket and 
threw back the lid. 

“A gorr plate with the royal arms!” exclaimed 
the astonished Sertez. “Carnelian!” he added. 
“The plate is from a woman." 

In the box was a square, thin block of a flesh- 
red color. I was excited, and my hands shook as 
I removed the plate. 

“How do vou know it is from a woman?” I 
asked. 

“Young, unmarried women use carnelian for 
communicating their thoughts,” answered Ser¬ 
tez; “grass widows use chrysoprase, the green 
variety of chalcedony * bachelors use a vari-

colored block of agate, and all other men employ 
onyx. 

“How do you contrive to learn the secrets of 
the plate?” I asked. 

“I will show you.” 

He reached for the carnelian block, but I thrust 
it behind me. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 


THE GORR PLATE. 

“This is mine, I believe you said,” I remarked 

“Very well,” he simpered, but I detected a flash 
of his eyes which made me distrustful. “Try for 
yourself, and you learn nothing. You are not 
educated up to it. Take the plate between your 
palms, so.” 

He held his palms close together, illustrating 
how I was to hold the thirfg. 

I did as directed. A delightful sensation, the 
very poetry of exquisite feeling sped along my 
nerves and centered in my brain. 

Apart from this, however, no tangible thought 
impressed itself on my mind. What mysteries 
were locked in the plate? I burned to know, yet 
dreaded using the only channel lying open to me. 

Sertez was a vdEH Still, he was a Nyllite, 
and had been brought up on gorr plates, so to 
speak. 

My imoatiencp tn receive the message over- 



The Gorr Plate. 


203 

came my repugnance of the means. I handed the 
royal block to the renegade. 

“Tell me what it says,” I requested. 

A gleam of satisfaction darted through his 
blue eyes. I knew I was playing into his hands,, 
but I also knew there was nothing else for it. 

He sank on a bearskin, the plate between his 
palms. Bending his head, he began in a low 
voice: 

“The thoughts of Ylma, Princess of Nyll, 
daughter of Boazar III., concerning momentous 
events taking place in the kingdom-, and concern¬ 
ing the Mack-haired, black-eyed stranger from 
beyond the ice wall, who is often in her mind and 
always abides in her heart!” 

I was for snatching the plate from this rene¬ 
gade, my rival; but what he had said only made 
me wildly eager for more. I could learn more 
through him alone, so I suffered him to proceed: 

“Wondrous and unheard-of things are hap¬ 
pening in the land of NyTlites, and I am filled with 
fearful forebodings. The other strangers, con^ 
jured from the sky by the hairless prophet, were 
condemned to death by oyd, but saved themselves 



204 Gorr Plate\ 

by offering to deliver to the king and his people 
thousands of keeses of the elixir introduced by 
the little prophet with the glass eyes, 

“Whereto the foreigners last to arrive have 
reared a strange structure filled with wonderful 
vats and called by them a distillery. Into this 
structure maize is carried, and from it keese upon 
keese of the elixir is taken, to the end that the 
whole kingdom may renew its youth. 

“But if youth must be renewed at such a price, 
it is my prayer that the All Wise will suffer me 
to age quickly and die, that I may no longer wit¬ 
ness the orgies of these, my people. 

“The king, my father, lies constantly in a state 
of torpor, the gentlemen in waiting sing songs 
and hold wassail from hour to hour, the ministers 
have lackluster eyes and mumble to themselves, 
and the business of state is at a standstill. 

“The people are even as the Churs, dull, be¬ 
sotted, reeling along the roads shouting, raving, 
filling the air \yith hideous sounds. They have 
become beasts and worse than beasts. 

“Princess Ylma cries aloud in her despair to 
the black-eyed stranger from the land,beyond the 
ice wall. Will he come to the rescue of the Hy¬ 
perboreans, save this distressed people, and gain 
the eternal gratitude of his unhappy Ylma? 



The Gorr Plate. 


205 


-Something tells me he will not ignore this prayer, 
and that I am as much in his heart as he is in 
mine 

The voice of Sertez ceased. While speaking 
his tones had become soft and gentle, as though 
he appropriated for himself the thoughts of the 
carnelian block. 

Then abruptly he leaped erect, with flaming 
face, and flung the gorr plate at my feet. In a 
voice husky with anger he cried: 

“You, black-haired interloper from the antip¬ 
odes, dare to raise your eyes to the Princess 
Ylma! You have the unblushing audacity to 
rival one of her own race! Miscreant!" 

“Renegade!” cried I hotly. 

“Captain, captain,” implored Prebble, observ- 
ingmy clenched fists, “be calm! 

“Calm,” I cried, “calm, when this banished 
scoundrel speaks to me in the manner he does? 
By the mizzentruck of the great Harry, he s the 
worst enemy King Boazar has! I’ll do my first 
stroke of work for Princess Ylma. 111 attend to 
this beggar so his pretty plan for raiding the 
country will fall through.” 



•206 


The Gorr Plate . 


Prebble stepped in front of me. 

“Enough of this, captain,” said he. “Remove 
your talk ring so that we may converse without 
letting Sertez understand our words,” 

I removed the ring, and strung it on my arm, 
meanwhile keeping wary and wrathful eyes on 
the renegade. I will say for him that he held 
his ground with great firmness, giving every in¬ 
dication of being a knave of courage—rather un¬ 
usual qualities to find together. 

“Now,” went on Prebble, his own ring in his 
hand, “let me tell you, captain, that it is unwise to 
arouse Sertez against us. Our safety among the 
Churs is problematical. We are alive by grace 
of your being esteemed the Thunder Maker, but 
the renegade has power with the Churs, and 
might at any moment withdraw us from their 
favor. We cannot afford to take chances.” 

“The scoundrel has designs upon the Princess 
lYlma!” I dared. 

Prebble looked at me keenly. 

“Have you any designs on the princess, cap¬ 
tain ?” he asked bluntly. 

“I am a man of honor,” said I, drawing up 



The Gorr Plate. 


20 7 

to my full height, “and that question is leading 
and highly personal” 

“Be sensible, captain,” begged Prebble. 

“Am I not? I growled, glowering into the 
saturnine face of Sertez, 

“You are not, if you contemplate an alliance by 
marriage with the princess. She is not of vour 
people, and she is of the royal family. Such a 
union would be a misalliance, and result in dis¬ 
aster. Believe me, Salis!” 

“She is a beautiful girl, and as good as she is 
beautiful,” I answered. 

“And you have seen her twice, and talked with 
her not at all Much you know about her, cap¬ 
tain.” 

“I am an explorer, Prebble, but that does not 
deny some small amount of sentiment in my 
soul” 

“Strangle this bit of sentiment. It has warped 
your judgment. Continue to harbor it, and you 
will suffer." 

“Suffer?” I echoed angrily. 

“Yes, suffer! Suppose you could get away 
from this part of the earth and return to other, 



20.8 The Gorr Plate ; 

parts we know better. Would you take Princess 
Alma with you?” 

“As Mrs. Salis, yes—if she would go.” 

“What would happen to the throne, in that 
event? When the times comes for Boazar to die, 
with Princess Ylma gone, the kingdom would fall 
into the hands of Sertez. Could there be a 
greater disaster ?” 

“And if Ylma were in.Nyll she would fall into 
the hands of Sertez. That, Prebble, is an in¬ 
finitely greater disaster.” 

He smiled. 

“You look at the princess through the small 
end of the telescope, captain,” said he, “and at 
the kingdom through the big end. As a conse¬ 
quence, the importance of the princess is magni¬ 
fied out of all proportion.” 

“There is no use arguing with me, Prebble,” I 
stormed. “I know my heart, man, and I will go 
my own way. As for this scoundrel, Sertez, I 
will save Nyll from his lawless intentions. When 
I am done with him there will be no chance of 
the kingdom, or of the princess, ever falling into 



The Gorr- Plate 

209 

his unworthy hands. I consider it a duty to put 

Sertez out of the way!” ' 1 

“And all this,” muttered Prebble, “because of 
the thought waves imbedded in one gorr plate! 
Are we all mad?” 

“Call it what you will, my mind is made up. 
Ylma has called upon me to save her father’s 
kingdom. Pollock has released an evil which had 
its inception with us; we are at fault, and the 
least we can do is to pay heed to the cry sent us 
by the princess in that carnelian block!” 

“Listen!” counseled the professor. “There is a 
possibility that Sertez did not translate the 
thought waves of the princess correctly.” 

“No possibility of that at all. He wanted to 
learn what thoughts the princess was sending to 

^ yy 

me. 

“He may have repeated to you a message which 
is not in the plate.” 

“N6, Prebble; the message proves itself to be 
correct. There’s no side-stepping all that about 
Pollock, the distiller’s son, flooding Nyll with that 
confounded elixir. It has happened, and all the 
rest has happened, just as Sertez told us. The 



210 


The Gorr Plate , 


sentiments of the princess were correctly trans¬ 
lated, and I’ll lay my life on it. That gorr plate 
is a call to action—a command—and we cannot 
ignore it.” 

“1 am as eager for action as you are, captain,” 
said Prebble, “but what can we do if we tie our 
hands by antagonizing Sertez?” 

“He is already antagonized. -In me he recog¬ 
nizes a rival, and that is more than enough to set 
him against the two of us. Stand aside! I tell 
you, professor, I am determined to see this 
through to the bitter end. We must strike a blowi 
for Nyll!” 

“You are subordinating the welfare of Nyll to 
that of the princess. If you slay Sertez, cap¬ 
tain, every Chur will be at our throats. Reflect, 
please, on that phase of the matter.” 

“I have reflected, and I tell you there is no time 
to lose!” 

Over the professor’s shoulder was the evil, 
leering face of the renegade, taunting me and 
giving me a dare to do my worst. 

In order to stop the professor’s arguments, I

dapped on the talk ring; then I started, by a 
detour, for Sertez, 

Prebble sought to hold me, but I shook him off. 
The next moment I hurled myself at the rene- 
gade. 

He was slender, and quick of movement, and 
managed to avoid me. Ducking under my fist, 
he raced for the entrance to the cave, picking up 
the gun and cartridge belt as he fled. 

“There he goes!” screamed Prebble. “He’s 
stealing our thunder! Don’t let him steal our 
thunder, captain!” 

I tried my best to overhaul the rascal, but he 
clawed through the opening a dozen feet in the 
lead. 

Down I went on my marrow bones to follow, 
^and * then, just as I was close to the exit, there 
came a crash, and the light of day was shut from 
my eyes. 

A huge bowlder, which had been kept in readi¬ 
ness, as I afterward learned, was knocked free, 
and fell across the entrance. 

Prebble and I were imprisoned in the cave! 
Imprisoned and rendered helpless when we weie

needed elsewhere. For my sole wish now was 
to get back to the princess and save her and her 
people from the doom that threatened them. 

I could have imitated the army in Flanders. 
It is possible I did, although the memory es¬ 
capes me.

escape. 

What is that? hai ped the queruious voice of 
the professor. 

“A bowlder blocks the entrance,” I answered* 

“Push it aside.” 

I had tried, without avail. 

“A locomotive couldn’t move it,” 1 panted. 

“Can't you squeeze around the edge?” 

“The opening is hermetically sealed. That 
scoundrel designed this for a living grave, Preb- 
ble.” 

I crept back to the torch beside which my com¬ 
panion crouched, wringing his hands. 

“Think of Nyll!” I said, in a hollow voice. 
“What noble minds are there overthrown. ” 

“Captain,” replied Prebble, in an awesome 
whisper, “we were the demons referred to in the 
legend.” 

‘“Aye,” I returned; “we saved our miserable 
lives with a flask of bourbon, and Pollock; the 
distiller's son, has completed the work. They

have built a gin mill, and the kingdom of Boazar 
is steeped in debauchery. The serpent has 
crawled into paradise 1 And the Princess Ylma! 
Merciful Heaven, what will become of her?’! 

I staggered erect and beat my brow with my 
clenched fists. 

“The opportunity of the Churs has arrived,” 
said Prebble, still in his awed whisper. “Led by 
the Great Ziff, the allied packs will sweep through 
the broken gate and lay Boazar’s domains in 
waste. Awful, captain 1 My soul shrinks at the 
thought.” 

“And that arch fiend, Sertez, will bear away 
the Princess Ylma!” I raved. “We must get out 
of here. We must, I tell you!” 

I crawled to the rock again and pushed until I 
saw stars. Not an inch could I move it. 

“Come back, captain,” called Prebble calmly. 
“Don’t waste your strength. Come back and let 
us think.” 

“Can we think ourselves out of this hole in 
the hillside?” I retorted. “Action is what we 
want.” 



'Escape. 


215 

“Thought must precede action. Come here 
and be quiet.” 

There was a command in his voice, and I 
crawled back to the torch once more, and 
crouched opposite him, watching his face in die 
sickly glare. 

It was a thin, strong face, the face of a 
thinker. His eyes gleamed and glowed as he 
cogitated. 

I was in the mood for quick and decisive ac¬ 
tion, and the necessity of inaction galled and 
fretted me. 

“First,” said the professor, “we must calm our¬ 
selves. A passive brain evolves the most fruit¬ 
ful suggestions.” 

“This is not the first time you have asked me 
to be calm,” I returned. “If my feelings were 
yours, Prebble, you would understand the use¬ 
lessness of the request.” 

“I am as much concerned as you are, captain, 
over the troubles that menace Nyll. Sertez, the 
renegade, seems destined to have his day. If 
Boazar dies, and the kingdom falls into the hands 
of Sertez-•’ 



2l6 


Escape . 


‘"You have already spoken of that, Prebble,” I 
interrupted. “If Boazar dies, and if Princess 
YIma does not reign as queen, regal authority 
fails into the hands of Count Zylox. We were 
told, vou remember, that Zylox is the head of an¬ 
other branch of the royal family. He is the pre¬ 
tender.” 

“You have not grasped my meaning, captain. 
Sertez, for hfs reward in helping the Great Ziff 
against his own people, will be given the hand of 
Ylma in marriage. Thus he will be the queen’s 
consort, and undoubtedly elevated to a high place 
in the wrecked kingdom.” 

After the Great Ziff gets through with Nyll,” 
I answered, in a hollow tone, “there will be noth¬ 
ing left to rule.” 

“The Churs will occupy the fertile plains of 
Nyll ; and will overrun and desecrate the palaces 
and the temples. Everything worth while will 
be trampled underfoot and destroyed, and the 
conquering brutes will brutalize everything good 
and noble with which they come in contact In 
time, however, the Nyllites will shake off.-the 
* stupor, recover their brilliant mental powers and

21 7 

reconquer their kingdom. It may require years 
perhaps decades, but that result will be evolved 
ultimately out of the wreck. Xyll will have 
learned a lesson, and can rebuild its glory on a 
firmer foundation.” 

“Let’s not forget, professor,” I reminded him, 
“that our present business is to escape from this 
cavern. We are needed, and we must not delay 
or waste our time in idle talk.” 

“The talk is not idle, captain,” replied Prebble. 
“My wits are at work upon this problem, and dis¬ 
course merely sharpens them. I had no liking 
for this Sertez from the first.” 

“Nor I,” was my response, “but we found our¬ 
selves of one mind on that point very soon after 
we fell into the hands of the Churs. In what 
way do you think we can effect our escape from 
this hole in the hillside?” 

“An idea has not yet offered itself, captain, but 
I have an instinctive feeling that I am close to 
a solution^ of the problem. Let the talk go on; 
while it flows I shall suddenly see the light.” 

Here was another inconsistency of Prebbte’s. 
At times, while he was busy with hi:, problems, he

wanted to be alone, and would bear with nothing 
that might distract him; here, at this time, he was 
eager for conversation, and declared it an aid to 
quick and effective thinking! 

As my mind was entirely wrapped up in the 
princess and the sorry plight of her father and 
his kingdom, I was at a loss to put forward any 
subject for discourse. The professor stepped 
into the breach. 

“What do you think of the Great Ziff ?” he in¬ 
quired. 

“Why, that he is a great fake. He is a myth, 
professor, and the myth has been developed as a 
sort of check on the wild Churs.” 

The professor shook his head. 

“He is no myth/’ he declared. “He is a sym¬ 
bol, indeed, but a living symbol. There is a vast 
amount of folk lore and tradition surrounding the 
Great Ziff, but the person himself is a reality. He 
is the real king of the Churs, and he keeps him¬ 
self hidden because he knows that , will bind his 
authority more closely around his savage sub¬ 
jects.” 

“Why all that tommy rot about the little boys 



Escape\ 


219 

in red caps, and monsters all head and no tail, 
and so on ? * Wheu.Sertez was talking to us about 
those things you yourself halted him and asked 
for facts, not fancies.” 

The fancies, as I now believe, captain, sym¬ 
bolize facts.” 

“I’m beyond my depth,” I observed helplessly. 

I see in the stories about the Great Ziff nothing" 
but fairy tales—chronicles of the Cid and Alice 
in Wonderland. Surely you don’t agree with 
the Churs that time has no effect upon the Ziff, 
and that he has lived always and will always live ?” 

“I believe the fact which that statement sym¬ 
bolizes,” asserted Frebble. “Since man inhabited 
the earth the idea for which the Ziff stands has 
been in the background, immutable, eternal.” 

“But \vhat is that idea?” 

Prebble stared at me. 

“There is sentiment in your soul, captain, and 
surely your wits should be able to match them¬ 
selves against the nimble fancies of a lot of hairy 
demons like these Churs?” 

“It’s a puzzle which I have no time to work 
on, at present. We must do something, Prebble* 



220 Escape * 

and at once. Haven't you thought of any way, 
out of here?" 

“I'am close to something, captain." 

His eyes, for several moments, had been fixed 
on the torch flame. 

"That," said he, pointing to the flare, "offers 
the suggestion that may lead us to freedom." 

"How?" 

"The opening, you say, is hermetically sealed?” 

"Yes." 

"You are sure?" 

"Positive." 

"Then what causes that flame to bend toward 
the rear of the cavern? There is a draft, and 
there could be no draft without an opening?" 

Right! I cried, overjoyed. "There is an exit 
somewhere." 

Pie pulled the toi;ch from its socket. Holding 
it in his hand, he walked slowly toward the back 
pai t of the cavern, watching the flame as it bent 
forward, directing him with flickering finger. 

The 1 oof dipped toward the floor. Prebble 
^ent down on hands and knees, still holding the 
torch and following as it commanded. 



'Escape. 


221 


He trailed away, and I saw Him weaving to 
and fro in the distance, the fluttering torch like 
a star. It was a star; our Star of Hope, if ever: 
we had one. 

Suddenly the little, reddish dot came to a 
standstill, and Prebble’s voice floated back to me. 

“Eureka!” he called. “Bring what's left of the 
biscuits and pemmican, captain.” 

I snatched up the bag—it was now light and 
of small dimensions—and followed my com¬ 
panion. He waited for me. 

“You’ll have a tight squeeze of .it," said he. 
‘‘When the great primordial cataclysm fashioned 
this hill it had the forethought to leave a narrow, 
passage through from the cavern to the top. I 
can see daylight ahead.' 1 

“Crawl for it,” I returned. “HI be close after 
you.” 

In some way I pushed and dragged myself 
through, and at last we emerged on the hillside 
overlooking the defile that lay at our cavern s 
taouth. From our position we could look down 
and see the great bowlder that had been balanced 
over the entrance.

Escape . 


The gully was full of Churs, and the center 
of interest seemed to be Sertez. The renegade 
had the gun, and was handling it with dangerous 
carelessness. 

“If,he’s not careful,” said I, “he’ll kill some¬ 
body.” 

The words were barely out of my mouth when 
the piece exploded, and one of the Churs fell in 
his tracks. Consternation seized upon every one, 
Sertez along with the rest. 

The destructive power of the gun had not 
before been brought home to these creatures, for 
the mere report of it had been sufficient to com¬ 
pass my ends. Now, however, the bungling of 
Sertez had wrought a catastrophe which caused 
the “thunder maker” to be doubly feared. 

The Churs prostrated themselves, and Sertez 
dropped the firearm' as though it had been a ser¬ 
pent, flinging the belt down upon it, and then 
retreating to a respectful distance. 

“This is our opportunity, professor,” said I, 
and we hurried down the slope and made ouC 
way to where the gun and Telt were lying. 



CHAPTER XX. 

THE GREAT ZIFF. 

It would be difficult to decide whether our ap¬ 
pearance in the defile, having apparently issued 
through the solid bowlder blocking our cave, or 
the fatal use of the shotgun, frightened these 
ravage creatures the more. 

On several occasions I had seen their primitive; 
minds overcome, but never to the extent that they 
were now. 

“How—how were you able to get out of the 
cave?" faltered Sertez. 

“It is not necessary for you to know," said I 
sternly, picking up the belt and buckling it around 
me and then possessing myself of the gun. “In¬ 
form Koz that we desire to go to the pole and in¬ 
terview the Great Ziff." 

"But you cannot——" 

“Do as I tell you T I broke in sternly, and em¬ 
phasized the command by pointing the gun in his 
direction. 

He gave a shout of horror, and ran to the chief. 



'224 


The GrAit Ziff . 


Koz listened attentively while Sertez told our 
wishes, and then approached us with our two 
servitors, Bigoll and Xit. 

Sertez did not venture in our proximity. fTom 
a distance he called: 

“Koz and his sons will accompany you.” 

“See to it, Sertez/’ I shouted, “that you head 
no foray into the Kingdom of Nyll, otherwise the 
‘thunder nicker’ shall speak in terms you cannot 
fail to understand/’ 

He showed his teeth in a snarling smile, and 
from that I knew that we were not yet done with 
him. Koz himself took the food bag and car¬ 
ried it across his shoulder, but neither he nor 
Bigoll nor Xit could be induced to bear the “thun¬ 
der maker/’ 

With the three Churs in the lead, our course 
led us down the defile and out through a country 
where Titans had at one time been at play, hurl¬ 
ing mountains at each other, piling them up fan¬ 
tastically. 

Steadily but surely we advanced upon the pil¬ 
lar of smoke and dust. 

As we went on, the. ground grew hotter be- 



The Great Ziff . J2 

neath us. Often we struck a spot where our feet 
wre compelled to fly upward in a wild dance, or 
bear the weight of our bodies on their toes. 

Everywhere was desolation. Contiguous to 
the great wall were areas where plants and trees 
grew and streams of warm water had their 
courses. 

But here the heat was fatal to plant life, and 
what moisture the ground contained was given 
off in steam. Still onward we kept our course, 
although it seemed every moment as though we 
must turn back. 

A weird exaltation thrilled me. For the pres¬ 
ent I forgot that I was seeking the Great Ziff to 
threaten him in case he seized upon the misfor¬ 
tunes of Nyll to make an invasion of the country. 

Again I was the polar explorer, searching for 
that baffling and elusive thing called the North 
Pole. With my eyes turned straight ahead of 
me, I pressed on and on. 

At last we reached a point beyond which it 
would have been suicide to venture. And there 
before us arose the goal of my ambition. 

Adequately to describe the soul-inspiring spec- 



226 


The Great Ziff . 


tacle is beyond me. No pen could do justice to 
the scene, least of all mine, which heretofore has 
been confined to the simple annals of the log 
book. 

.1 have seen a volcano in eruption, and the vom¬ 
iting forth of fire, and smoke, and dust bear some 
resemblance to this polar phenomenon. Here the 
zone of activity was half a mile in diameter, com¬ 
pletely circular. 

Within the vortex, as the veil shifted, the great 
spindle was disclosed, a mighty bulwark of ce¬ 
lestial law and order—without which there could 
be no night, no day—no certainty of recurring 
seasons—no life on this fruitful planet. 

Entranced, we stood and watche'd the won¬ 
drous whirligig perform its mighty evolution. 

Nearly three hundred and fifty feet per hour it 
moved, more than five feet per minute—the 
grand, majestic sweep of a vast world, set spin¬ 
ning in the night of ages by the Creator’s all- 
powerful hand. 

Prebble and I stood dumb in the presence of 
the stupendous mechanism, Koz and his sons 
lying prostrate, pouring upon their heads the dust 



The Great Ziff . 


227 


of humility and reverence. Thus, in our sev¬ 
eral ways, did the finite pay tribute to the In¬ 
finite. 

“We must build a cairn,” said I hoarsely, turn¬ 
ing my bloodshot eyes upon Prebble. 

“Why a cairn ?” he asked. 

“As a mark to commemorate this visit, a proof 
to any who follow that Captain Salis and Phineas 
Prebble have been here before them.” 

“The Churs were here before any of us/’ said 
Prebble. “Can you go away and claim the dis¬ 
covery of the North Pole when human eyes have 
already looked upon it?” 

His eyes, looking out at me from lids inflamed 
by the heat, twinkled oddly. 

“We have been first to pierce the ice wall,” I 
answered, “and are entitled to be called discov¬ 
erers.” 

“Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re” murmured 
tny learned companion. “You might just as well 
cl^im the discovery without seeing the thing dis¬ 
covered. I see small difference in the ethics of 
the case.” 

He hopped around to ease his stewing feet. 



22 8 


The Great Ziff . 

“If we were on cooler ground, professor/' said 
I, “we might go into that subject more exhaus¬ 
tively. Let’s give our attention to the cairn, how¬ 
ever.” 

“Who will know what the cairn stands for, in 
case it happens to be found?” 

“We will leave a tablet and a flag.” 

“It is hot for such work,” and the professor 
drew a hand across his dripping forehead, “and 
I fail to see the usefulness of it.” 

“Explorers always build cairns,” I cried ir¬ 
ritably. 

“Then, mirabile dictu , let us build one!” 

“Set the Churs to collecting stones,” I ordered, 
“while I prepare the tablet.” 

He hopped away over the steaming stones, and 
got the Churs at work. After a short search I 
discovered a piece of flat, slatelike rock, soft 
enough to take the sharp point of a piece of agate. 
With great care I scratched the following on the 
slate tablet: 

“At this point, during the summer of 1901, 
arrived Captain C. G. Salis, U. S. A., and Pro¬ 
fessor Phineas Prebble, having set out from 



The Great Ziff. 


229 

America in the year 1900 on a voyage of dis¬ 
covery and exploration.” 

I showed the inscription to Prebble. 

“You have left out the most important point!” 
he cried. 

“What is that?” 

You have said nothing' about niv own dis¬ 
coveries, the proof I have developed regarding 
the meteoric theory of the aurora.” 

‘Til add that as a postscript,” said I, by way 
of humoring him. 

So I appended the following : 

“During the progress of the polar expedition, 
said Professor Prebble demonstrated the truth of 
the meteoric theory of the aurora.” 

“Will that do?” I inquired. 

“Very well,” he answered, greatly pleased. 
“Now, if neither of us live to return to our own 
country, and some other explorer is able to come 
to this benighted region, 1 shall have my niche 
in the hall of fame. But the tablet is still in¬ 
complete.” 

The tablet already had scorched my fingers, 



The Gn-u: Ziff. 


230 

and was becoming altogether too hot for any 
more inscriptions. 

“What else is there?” I asked impatiently. 

“My theory concerning the failure of the hu¬ 
man mind north of the arctic circle/’ said he. 
“Put that in.” 

“I will not,” I answered, and went down on 
my knees to affix the jfiece of slate in the hot 
earth. 

Upon this we piled our gathered rocks. I su¬ 
perintended the laying of the stones, and, consid¬ 
ering the difficulties under which we worked, I 
believe that a most excellent cairn was con¬ 
structed, and one that must still remain on that 
very spot. 

It was trying labor, and we sweated over the 
task. The Churs labored in a state of awe and 
apprehension, pausing constantly to look around 
them as though they expected something to hap¬ 
pen, they scarcely knew what. 

Their actions communicated to me a certain 
uncanny feeling which had begun with the vast 
mechanism of the pole itself. 

“I’m getting nervous,” confided the professor. 



The Great Ziff. 


231 


“We are in a region well qualified to make any 
one nervous,” I answered, making ready to lay 
the final stone on the apex of the heap. 

“Let's have done with this cairn building, cap¬ 
tain, and move to some other place.” 

“We must continue our examination of the 
pole,” said I. “I greatly regret that we have not 
the instruments ^necessary to make an observa¬ 
tion.” 

“It's too torrid for observations, and we’ve 
already lingered here so long that the soles of 
my feet are literally done to a turn.” 

“Perhaps we shall never be able to come here 
again, and we ought to make the most of our 
visit.” 

At the precise moment the final stone was 
added to the heap my attention was attracted by 
fearful cries from the Churs. 

I faced about, and at once my startled gaze 
encountered a sight that froze my blood. The 
veil of smoke, dust, and flame was parted by a 
form that plunged through it like a swimmer 
through the sea, separating the red billows with 
his naked hands. 



232 


The Great Ziff 

The figure was that of a Chur of gigantic pro¬ 
portions* His face was the face of the arch¬ 
fiend, monstrous in its every feature. 

The eyes were like diamonds ; the teeth long, 
yellow, and two of them overhanging the nether 
lip like tusks; the long, red hair writhed as so 
many tongues of fire about head and shoulders, 
and the long, furry limbs moved with marvelous 
rapidity. 

A whip seemed lashing my brain with stinging 
force; and at every blow the voice of Sertez rang 
in my ears: 

“The Great Ziff! Nozv will you believe?” 

In one hand this hideous giant carried a skull; 
in the other hand a thigh bone. Again and again 
he would strike the skull, and a dull, sepulchral 
sound would be the result. 

As he pounded his horrid drum he would roar, 
in monotonous tones, syllables which sounded like 
Us-kwee-baw, Us-kwee-baw! Then, at intervals, 
he would lift the thigh bone and point south¬ 
ward. 

It must not be supposed that we saw this 
frightful creature long. At one leap he cleared 



The Great Ziff. 


2 33 


the pole and touched earth, then away he flew at 
a Brobdingnagian pace, pointing southward, 
beating the skull and roaring his Us-kzccc-bazv! 

I looked at Prebble. His head was in his 
hands. I turned to where the Churs had been ly¬ 
ing, and saw that they had departed, following 
the Great Ziff at top speed. 



CHAPTER XXI. 


BACK TO NYLL. 

Had our series of remarkable adventures in 
this circumpolar country not hardened us to the 
improbable and the unexpected, Prebble and I 
would have thought ourselves gone daft. 

“Let’s get out of this,” said the professor 
huskily, picking up the biscuit and pemmican bag. 

I grabbed the shotgun from the rocks, scarcely 
noticing that the barrels blistered my hands. 
Then away we went on the track of the Great 
Ziff, Koz, Bigoll, and Xit. 

“What is your present opinion of the Great 
Ziff, Prebble?” I asked, when we had reached 
cooler ground, and could walk and talk with some 
little comfort. 

“Don’t ask me,” he begged. “Imagination ap¬ 
pears to have taken the place of sober sense. 
Event follows event so swiftly that all seems a 
riot of the imagination. The scientific mind finds 
nothing firm enough to stand on, and hence all 



Back to Nyll. 235 

scientific deduction falls flat. I behold and mar¬ 
vel, captain; I make no attempt to explain.” 

‘The furies are unleashed,” said I sadly. .“Nyll 
will be-overrun, and all her magnificent, civiliza¬ 
tion laid waste. The Great Ziff heads the allied 
packs, and every Chur is like a ravening wolf.” 

“We must hasten back to Nyll,” averred the 
professor. 

“But what can we do?” 

“We can save the kingdom,” he answered 
promptly, “or as much of it as is left when we 
arrive.” 

“How?” 

“Leave that to me. Let your care be the res¬ 
cue of Princess Ylma.” 

Our apprehensions spurred us on to greatest 
effort Just before we reached the defile from 
which we had issued #to begin our journey to the 
pole, we surmounted an elevation that afforded 
us a view of the wall, the broken gate, and the 
plain beyond. 

A host of Churs was flowing southward. The 
passage through the wall was like a stiait, the 



Back to Nyll, 


2 36 

animated billows crushing through and spreading 
out once more on reaching the sandy stretch. 

As far as the eye could reach the inundation 
rolled, and we had no doubt that in the lead 
rushed the Great Ziff, sounding his infernal toc¬ 
sin and roaring his mysterious slogan. 

“Thus ignorance overwhelms learning/’ mut¬ 
tered Prebble, “and brute force subdues the 
mind/' 

“Let us not halt/' I cried, in fierce impatience; 
“on, Prebble, on!” 

\Ye could not overtake the procession of war¬ 
riors, but we came among the women and chil¬ 
dren, straggling along in the rear. 

It was hours before we reached the populous 
portion of Nyll, and what a melancholy spectacle 
greeted us on every hand! Houses were burn¬ 
ing, and the Churswvere everywhere like the red 
imps of Satan, carrying* their spoils upon their 
backs, or driving Nyllites before them, loaded 
.with the loot of their own dwellings. 

It appeared to have been the policy of the Great, 
Ziff, to snare, that the Churs might enslave; 



#ack to NylL 237 

Everywhere there was brutality, but nowhere 
could we see bloodshed. 

As we made along the road toward the king’s 
palace an oyd car came tearing toward us. In 
the car were two men whom I recognized as 
Griffyn and Pollock. 

“Halt!” I commanded, placing myself in the 
middle of the roadway and raising my hand. 

They did not slacken speed, and would have 
cut me down but for the shotgun. I raised it to 
my shoulder and aimed carefully. 

“Halt, or I fire!" 1 cried again. 

This time I was obeyed. 

“Great Heaven!” cried Griffyn, as he stopped 
the car. “Can this be Salis and—and Prebble? 

“Don’t say you failed to recognize us, I an¬ 
swered. 

"But I did, though. What has happened to 
you?” 

P “There’s no time to talk of ourselves,” I cried; 
“we must do something to stem this tide of in¬ 
vasion.” 

“What can be done? The men of the king- 



2^8 Back to NylL 

dom are confounded, and have fallen easy vic¬ 
tims to their old-time enemies.” 

“Where are you going, Griffyn?” 

“To the distillery on a mission for Princess 
lYlma.” 

“Ha! Where is the princess ?” 

“Locked in a room in the king's palace.” 

“What are you going to do?” 

“Burn that accursed distillery to the ground.” 

“You are mad!” broke in the professor pas¬ 
sionately. 

I looked at him in amazement. 

“What do you mean?” asked Griffyn and Pol¬ 
lock in one breath. 

“If that distillery had never been built,” said I, 
“this awful invasion would never have happened. 
You”—and I leveled a trembling forefinger at 
Pollock—“are responsible for all!” 

“You and Prebble are responsible,” flung back 
Pollock. “You taught King Boazar to use the 
elixir, in the first place.” 

“We gave him the flask in order to save our* 
lives.” 



Back to Nyll. 


2 39 

“And we,” spoke up Pollock, “built the dis¬ 
tillery to save our own.” 

‘‘Have done with this wrangling,” interrupted 
the professor. “We are all of us at fault; but 
we are human, life is dear to us, and sometimes 
we buy it at too great a price. Have you any 
elixir on hand, Pollock?” 

“Several thousand keeses.” 

“Any tanks and oyd cars at the distillery?” 

“Half a dozen, at least.” 

“Then I will go with you, and we will save the 
kingdom!” 

He turned on me with a hearty grip of the 
hand. 

“I must leave you, captain. It is necessary, 
for you have your work to do, as I have mine. 
You remember what his lordship told us about 
the Nyllite who penetrated the ice wall? The 
work now going on is strictly according to Gnei- 
sen. Shrewd fellow, that Gneisen!” 

He sprang into the oyd car. 

“Siniilia similibus curantur! To the distillery^ 
Griffyn, top speed.” 

While we had stood in the road talking, man^ 



240 


Back to Nyll . 


Churs passed us, but gave us little notice. Pos¬ 
sibly they were too intent on the nefarious work 
before them. 

I journeyed on,-the horrors thickening about 
me as I proceeded. A whir of wheels from be¬ 
hind claimed my attention, and I turned just as 
a familiar voice called my name. 

A car was darting in my direction; to the 
broad seat in its center Lord Nylis was bound, 
and in the front point was Klimon—faithful Kli¬ 
mon!—shrieking like a fiend. 

“Save me, captain!” implored Lord Nylis* 
“Klimon is taking me to the Great-Ziff!” 

I ordered the rebellious slave to halt. His an¬ 
swer was a defiant yelp: I fired at him, and he 
tumbled over the iron box into the road, closing 
the screen with his falling body. 

The car stopped. At once I sprang aboard 
and tore the ropes from his lordship's hands. 

i You have saved me from a fate worse than 
death, captain,'’ said his lordship, “and I thank 
you.” 

Suddenly his body stiffened^ and he eyed me 
sharply. 



Back to NylL 


241 

It was reported that you and the professor 
had gone over to the Churs. Are you concerned 
in this raid?” 

"We are concerned in it, sir, to the extent of 
trying to save the kingdom,” I answered. “As 
to going- over to the Churs, it was either that or 
death by oyd. The Churs spared us, and we 
have returned to be of all the assistance to King 
B.oazar that we can.” 

Lord Nylis shook his head sadly. 

“You can do nothing, I fear. The king and 
nine-tenths of the nobles and people have suc¬ 
cumbed to your elixir, and its baneful effects are 
everywhere apparent. Our powers of mind have 
suffered eclipse. The kingdom is doomed!" 

“The case is hardly as bad as that, I hope.” 

“The condition of affairs could not be worse. 
Every slave in the country has risen, and even 
the slaves outnumber the Nyllites two to one. 
Add their numbers to the horde that has swept 
down on us from the north, and you will under¬ 
stand how desperate is the situation. Ivlimon, 
whom I have owned for years, turned on me, and 
was conveying me to the Great Ziff!” 



242 


Back to NylK 


“What for?” 

“To present me to him as a slave.” 

“Horrible!” I looked back at the still form 
in the road. “He will have no further part in 
the insurrection,” I addejd. 

“I tried to conquer him with my will, but his 
fanaticism was aroused by the coming of the 
Great Ziff, and he turned my glances as though 
clad in armor.” He laid his hand on my knee as 
he asked: “Where is the professor, captain?” 

“Gone to rescue the kingdom,” I answered. 
“Griffyn and Pollock are with him.” 

“What can they do?” 

“They can turn the weapon that has cost you 
so dear against your enemies. We have a say¬ 
ing in our country that dike cures like/ If this 
is true, and if the Churs take to the elixir, and 
the Nyllites abstain from it, the country may yet 
be saved.” 

Hope darted into his face. 

“I had not thought, of that,” he said. “But let 
us on to the palace. I am worried about his 
majesty.” 



CHAPTER XXII. 

“according to gneisen.” 

Lord Nylis took the driver's seat, and drove 
the car at full speed along the road. Many at¬ 
tempts were made to interfere with us, but the 
shotgun stood us in good stead, and we finally 
reached the palace steps unmolested. 

The king’s guard, to the last warrior, had 
turned against Count Zylox, and he had been 
compelled to barricade himself in one of the state 
apartments. 

The count was another of those who had re¬ 
sisted the temptations of the elixir, and from 
one of the palace windows he called down and 
acquainted us with his predicament. 

“Where is the king?” asked Lord Nylis. 

“In the throne room. The Princess Ylma is 
with him, and has barricaded the doors. Hark!” 

Count Zylox raised his hand. 

“Can you not hear them?” he asked. “Sertez, 
with a score of Churs at his back, is endeavoring 
to batter down the doors and capture the king. 



244 


“According to Gneisen” 


I will descend and join you. Perhaps we may 
be able to exert our power over some of the 
slaves and the guard. Wait for me in the grand 
hallway/' 

There were no Churs on the steps or in the 
hallway. All in the vicinity of the palace were 
helping Sertez force entrance into the audience 
chamber. 

The count carried a spear, and Lord Nylis 
picked up another from the floor. 

“What does the foreigner here?” asked the 
count, vouchsafing me a harsh look. 

“Cherish no animosity, count,” said his lord- 
ship. “The captain is^ truly our friend. His 
companion, the professor, has gone to save the 
kingdom.” 

“How?” 

“There is no time for explanations. Let it 
suffice for you to know that this man is my 
friend, and has recently preserved me from my 
enemies. The thunder machine he carries is 
to stand us in good stead. To the throne room, 
count, before it is too late.” 

We started forthwith, the sound of a heavy 



u According to Gneisen ” 


2 45 

blow and a crash accelerating our steps, A wild 
scream echoed through the apartments. 

“The princess!” cried the count, beginning* to 
run. 

“They have demolished the doors!” gasped his 
lordship. 

Presently we flung into the vast chamber. The 
sun was gleaming through the windows and re¬ 
flecting a fiery color from the blood-red tiles of 
the floor. 

Backward and forward, as in a crimson tide, 
swerved the hairy, seminude forms of the Churs. 
Their yelping tones, the clashing of their imple¬ 
ments of war, caused a deafening din in the 
room. 

King Boazar occupied the massive chair on 
the dais. PI is hands hung listlessly over the arms, 
and his head was bowed forward. It might have 
been an attitude of sorrow' and despair, but I 
attributed it to another cause. 

Before him, at the top of the short flight of 
steps, stood Princess Ylma, her eyes glowing 
and her arms outspread to block the advance of 
Sertez. The. renegade stood below, his foot cm 



246 “According to Gneisen!* 

the first step and his gloating gaze turned up¬ 
ward. 

“Nothing can keep us apart now, Ylma!” he 
cried. “I have leveled every barrier that stood 
between us.” 

“Except one;” she qualified, gazing at him 
scornfully. 

“What is that?” 

“My loathing for you, Sertez!” 

A mocking laugh rang from his lips. 

“I shall level that, my lady—trample it under¬ 
foot along with the foolish pride that has made 
you look down on me. You are to be mine, my 
princess, mine!” 

He started to mount the steps. I was almost 
upon him, but Count Zylox was a little in advance 
of me. 

Catching Sertez about the neck with one arm, 
the count hurled him backward. The renegade 
saved himself a fall by clutching at one of the 
Churs. 

He whirled about, gripping his spear, and fixed 
his glaring eyes on Count Zylox. The count re¬ 
turned the glare with steady intensity. 



"According to Gneisen” 


247 


Our entrance into the throne room had been 
silently made, and we had reached the foot of 
the dais almost before our presence was dis¬ 
covered. 

These Churs happened to be from the pack 
of Koz. Thus I was known to them, and the 
terrors of the “thunder maker,” which I carried, 
threw over them a spell of silence and inaction. 

Princess Ylma was gazing at me as though 
she dared not credit her senses. Facing Lord 
Nylis, I exchanged the shotgun for his spear, 
and crept closer to Sertez and Count Zylox. 

“Traitor!” cried the count. “Your lying lips 
have given insult to the daughter of your sov¬ 
ereign-” 

“I am a banished man; I have no sovereign.” 

“Nor will you have any country but hell when 
I am done with you! Cross spears with me if 
you dare.” 

The count was a man after my own heart. He 
showed a spirit that aroused my admiration, and 
I was sorry he was not a friend of mine. 

Sertez sprang to the fray with a laugh and a 



248 “ According * to Gneisen ” 

taunt, the count met him bravely, and spear struck 
spear. 

Then it was thrust, parry, thrust, parry—now 
high, now low—the spear heads shimmering as 
they darted toward each other like serpents’ 
tongues—the count forcing Sertez back, step by 
step, and again Sertez pressing the count. 

There was a monotony about it all in spite of 
the fascination which a battle to the death will 
always call forth. But the monotony was sud-: 
denly varied. 

Sertez leaned forward like lightning. His 
spear point fell, rose, and there was a reddish 
stain marring the brightness of it. 

With a muttered anathema, the count caught 
the haft of his weapon in his left hand, and 
continued the battle, his right arm hanging limp 
at his side. I tried to press forward and draw 
the attention of Sertez. 

'‘One. at a time !” cried the renegade. 

‘Back!” commanded the count fiercely. “No 
man .shall rob me of the pleasure of running this 
traitor through the heart.” 

I was eager to be at Sertez, for v. e had a score 



“According to Gneisen 249 

to settle on account of that little affair in the cave. 
Still, I could not insist on displacing the count. 

The combat went on. Zylox fought at a terrible 
disadvantage, as was apparent to all of us, and 
from the throne Princess Ylma watched with 
breathless lips and pallid cheeks. 

The stertorous breathing of the 'king came to 
our ears through the dead silence, and now and 
again he would move restlessly and mutter in¬ 
coherently. 

Once more there was the monotony of thrust 
and parry, above, below, and clash, clash as the 
spear heads met and sent ringing echoes through 
the vaulted chamber. 

A diversion came, and came quickly. The 
count slipped on the'jasper tiles, and went down, 
his weapon flying from his hand. 

A slight scream escaped Princess \ lma. With 
a cry of triumph, Sertez plunged at his oppo¬ 
nent’s breast, but I struck the long shaft aside, 
thereby earning curses from both Sertez and the 
count. 

Then Sertez and I went at it. The renegade 
was not as fresh as I was, but, on ihe contrary.

he had not the same unpracticed hand which I 
was compelled to use. 

A repetition of the previous performance was 
begun. I was more awkward than the count, 
however. 

Every moment was a close shave for me, but 
after some fashion J bungled out of the traps 
set for my ’prentice skill. I fought blindly, per¬ 
sistently, pressing my foe at every point, in spite 
of the perilous play of his spear head. 

I remembered only the insult in the cave, and 
even forgot that the eyes of the princess were 
upon me. Z-z-z-z-ip, swish! I had caught a 
chiseling blow in the shoulder. 

A scream reminded me of the presence of Prin¬ 
cess Ylma. 

“Lord Nylis, end this!” she cried. “I beg you 
save the stranger’s life!” 

“Hands off, your lordship!” I shouted. “You 
don’t know what I owe this fellow!” 

Sertez was at me again, cool, diabolical, wear¬ 
ing a crafty smile. By now there was bkxxf on 
the floor. I retreated, coaxing him over the 
pool.

He followed. I sank to one knee, presenting 
my spear point. He slipped, as I had anticipated. 

But he did not fall backward, as I believed 
he would. He pitched forward upon my weapon 
and it impaled him to the heart. 

Prone on the floor he lay, the long shaft cling¬ 
ing to his breast. As we stood over him, an ap¬ 
palling sound floated to us from the distant cor¬ 
ridor. 

Poom, poom, poom! 

“Us-kwee-baw , Us-kwee-baw, Us-kzvee-baw!” 



CHAPTER XXIII. 


PECULIARITIES OF THE ZIFF. 

The Churs dropped in a flash. Zylox, Nylis, 
and I sprang to the throne steps, and ranged our¬ 
selves abreast for the defense of the king and 
Princess Ylma. 

I had no spear, but I picked up the one wielded 
by Sertez, gave it to his lordship, and took from 
him the gun. 

“The Great Ziff!” whispered the count 
hoarsely. 

“He will excite these Churs to frenzy,” mut¬ 
tered Lord Nvlis. 

“Supposing- he were killed? 7 ’ I asked. 

“That, at one blow, would settle the insurrec¬ 
tion,” declared the count. 

“But he can t be killed/' supplemented his 
lordship. 

“We shall see,” I responded. 

The next moment the hideous giant bounded 
into the chamber, beating his gruesome drum and 
roaring his horrid war cry.

Princess Ylma sank to her knees, with her face 
in her hands. The king roused himself and 
staggered to his feet, his bleared eyes resting on 
the monster. 

“There/’ he cried, '‘see them!’' 

“See what?” asked the count.. 

“The little boys in the red caps! Ha! Take 
’em away ! They’re on my back, on my head, 
holding my arms, dragging me down! Have I 
any loyal subjects left? The monsters, the creep¬ 
ing things, the—the-” 

With a gurgling cry, his majesty dropped back 
into the throne chair, thrashing his arms wildly. 
The princess sprang up and threw her arms about 
his neck protectinglv. 

Poom, poom, poom! echoed the grinning skull. 

" Us-kwee-baw!” roared the Great Ziff, and 
pointed the thigh bone at the king. 

The Churs sprang erect. 

“Now, captain, if you can do anything, whis¬ 
pered his lordship frantically, ‘ now! 

The giant was advancing upon the throne. In 
a trice I raised the gun and gave him both bar- 
rels. 



254 


Peculiarities of the Ziff. 


The roar in that confined space was awful be¬ 
yond words. As the smoke cleared, we saw the 
Great Ziff sprawled on the floor. 

We gazed, and—I am telling what I beheld 
with my awn eyes—even as we looked his form 
faded into thin air, so that we saw nothing but 
the blood-red tiles. 

And then from without we heard the sepul¬ 
chral sounds of bone and skull, and the roar of 
the Ziff as strong as ever. 

The Churs rushed from the throne room and 
from the palace, while the count, his lordship, 
and I hastened to one of the windows. 

There this colossal creature stood, gathering 
his cohorts, unharmed in body or limb. 

I was sorry the professor was not a witness 
of this proceeding, for he, afterward told me I 
must have been frightened out of my wits, so 
that fear colored my account of the extraordi¬ 
nary event. Those who have followed me so 
far, I trust, will know me better than that. 

“Barricade the palace doors!” cried Count 
Zylox. “We three will hold the place against 
the invaders!” 



feculiarities of the Ziff. 


2 55 


We hurried to follow out his suggestion. After 
every door had been secured, we looked down 
from a lofty window, and, to our intense sur¬ 
prise, found that the Great Ziff and his followers 
had left the vicinity of the palace. 

“We are safe for the present,” said Lord Nylis, 
heaving a sigh of relief. 

“The Ziff will return,” averred the count. 

“Until he does,” went on his lordship, turning 
to me, “there will be little for you to do, cap¬ 
tain. If you would like to go to the lavatory 
and make a change of garments, I will be glad to 
conduct you.” 

He made the suggestion out of the kindness 
of his heart, and I was grateful to him for it. 
In truth, I was a sorry-looking representative of 
the United States Army as I stood before him. 

I still wore what remained of my buskins, but 
they were the sole relics of my former state. In 
the land of the Churs,' Prebble and I had both 
donned the prevailing bearskin, and while mine 
covered me from shoulders to knees, and was 
respectable enough, yet it was hardly a com t cos¬ 
tume, even for those trying times. 



Peculiarities of the Ziff . 


256 

While I was engaged in making myself more 
presentable, Lord Nylis, from an adjoining room, 
beguiled my labors with conversation. 

“I-always knew we should hear from Sertez 
in some such manner,” said he. 

“Who is this Sertez?” I inquired. 

“A scoundrel and a renegade.” 

“I have discovered that much for myself, your 
lordship. I have also learned that he has been 
among the Churs since the beginning of the long 
day. He was banished?” 

“Yes. That was a mistake, however.” 

“Mistake?” 

“In this way, captain: He should have been 
condemned to death by oyd instead of merely 
being banished. Count.Zylox and I were anxious 
to see him receive the death penalty, but Princess 
Ylma prevailed with the king, and sentence of 
banishment was pronounced.” 

I was washing the reef stain from my shoul¬ 
der. The wound was merely a scratch, and in 
no wise interfered with my usefulness. Eagerly 
I caught at his lordship’s mention of the prin¬ 
cess. 



Peculiarities of the - Ziff. 2 ^j 

“Why did the princess interfere in behalf of 
Sertez?” I queried. 

“That trenches upon the matter for which Ser¬ 
tez was sent away," was the reply. “There is 
no reason why 1 should not tell you about it, 
captain. You have been of great service to the 
king* and the princess, and the kingdom is under 
a vast obligation to you." 

“I shall be glad to hear about it,” said I. 

“Sertez,” his lordship went on, “was made 
much of by King Boazar. The fortune of Sertez 
was small, but wealth is no bar to advancement 
in the Kingdom of Nyll. His majesty conceived 
a liking for Sertez, and took him into the palace 
as one of the gentlemen in waiting. The posses¬ 
sion of twenty Churs entitles a Nyllite to a patent 
of nobility, for, in the old times, to rule a score 
of Churs one proved the possession of a power¬ 
ful intellect, and intellect alone admitted to the 
peerage. One who aspired to be a noble was 
required to capture his Churs with his own hands, 
and subdue them. Sertez, with great bravery, 
won his tw r enty slaves, and was taken into the 
palace as one of the king’s household. 



2gg Peculiarities of the Ziff. 

Iiis lordship paused for a moment, and-1 had 
a little time to dwell upon the peculiar abilities 
necessary before one could become a noble of that 
queer kingdom. 

“Once in the palace/’ proceeded Lord Nylis, 
“Sertez had the presumption to lift his eyes to 
the princess. Thus, in a way, he proved himself 
a serpent, and struck at the hand which fed him. 
Princess Ylma is designed by the king as a mate 
for Count Zylox, thus welding the two branches 
of the royal family together and averting v dis¬ 
cord when the time comes for the king to pass. 
Sertez-” 

“Is that right, Lord Nylis ?” I demanded. 
“Should the king use fiis power to consummate 
such an alliance? Is not Princess Ylma to have 
a choice in the matter ?” 

“Princesses of the blood, captain,” came sadly 
from his lordship, “are but pawns in the game 
of royalty. Their lots are cast wherever policy 
may elect. In this case, and I quite coincide with 
his majesty, the two branches of the royal family 
must be united. From what J have said about 
the king’s plans for his daughter, you will under- 



■Peculiarities of the Ziff. 2 $g 

stand more clearly the presumption of Sertez in 
aspiring to the hand of the princess. She repulsed 
him, and placed the matter before the king. Hi 5 
majesty was enraged, and summoned Sertez be¬ 
fore "him to answer for his actions. Sertez was 
found guilty and condemned to death by oyd. 
Princess Ylma interfered, and the sentence was 

commuted to banishment.” 

* 

“The princess should not have interfered, : ” 
said I. 

“Most assuredly not; but she has a tender 
heart, and could not bear to think that Sertez 
.was to suffer death on her account.’’ 

“It is all one with Sertez now, Lord Nylis. He 
was spared to plan with the Churs the destruction 
of the kingdom, bur his end has finally overtaken 
him.” 

“The evil has been accomplished,” commented 
Lord Nylis, with a heavy sigh, “and it will be 
long before my country recovers from the blow. 

“It is a lesson to your country,” said I. It 
should teach all of you to beware of anything 
indulgence in which will tend to becloud your 
faculties.” 



260 


Peculiarities of the Ziff. 

“We did not know the powers of this elixir.” 

“For which the professor and I are guilty., 
I acknowledge the debt we owe your people, Nylis, 
and we are doing what we can to atone for our 
misguided actions/’ 

“I lay nothing at your door, captain. You and 
your companion had to do something to preserve 
your lives, arid you took the readiest means at 
hand. I am hopeful, as you say, that my country 
will profit by the grievous lesson. Do you think 
the professor will succeed in his workr ’ 

“I am positive of it,” said I, with conviction. 
“Prebble is an able man, and when he sets his 
hand to a piece of work he usually accomplishes 
it The elixir is a weapon that works both ways. 
Savages are especially partial to it. The Churs 
are not gifted with the reasoning powers of the 
Nyllites, and will easily fall victims to the insid¬ 
ious beverage. You and your people, on the other 
hand, will profit by the lesson and abstain from 
such elixirs in future.” 

“The easiest way to make us abstain is to re¬ 
move the elixir from among us. The place where 



Peculiarities of the Ziff. 2 g 

it is manufactured must be destroyed at the ear¬ 
liest possible moment." 

“That will be attended to. Is the process of 
manufacture known to any of the Nyllites?” 

No; Pollock and Griffyn have kept the process 
a secret.’ 7 

“Good!' 7 I exclaimed. 

Before another Hour had passed I felt a dif¬ 
ferent man. Immediately after emerging from 
the lavatory and dressing chamber I repaired to 
the throne room. 

Princess Ylma was still beside the king, who 
was recovering slightly, and calling for more of 
the elixir. The moment I entered, she descended 
and came toward me with outstretched hands. 

The count, as I observed, had thoughtfully 
dragged the body of Sertez from the apartment, 
and only the stains of blood remained to mark 
the spot where the sanguinary struggle had taken 
place. 

Save for the king, we were alone, the princess 
and I. I caught her hands and held them for a 
moment, peering into her wonderful blue eyes. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

A PERILOUS ATTACHMENT. 

“I knew you would come,” she said softly, her 
lids drooping and the color coming and going 
in her full, round cheeks. 

“I came quickly, my princess,” said I, “but 
could not arrive before the Churs.” 

“You are a stranger,” she said, flashing a quick 
look at me, “and I cannot be your princess.” 

“Nevertheless,^’ I returned, dropping on one 
knee and pressing her hands to my lips, “you are 
my princess, and I must call you so.” 

She raised me gently. 

“I was told that you would not be able to 
learn the secrets of the gorr plate,” she proceeded, 
as I stobd at her side. 

“I learned them,” I answered, not thinking it 
necessary to describe the means. 

“Then, am I-” She hesitated, her lips trem^ 

bling. 

“You are ever in my heart,” I whispered. 



A Perilous Attachment. 


263 

And you think of me in the same manner that 
I think of you ?” 

“Yes,” I replied. “Ever since you saved my 
companion and myself at the lake you have never 
'been absent from either mind or heart.” 

A lover must be allowed some latitude, even 
at the pole, where latitude is stretched to its far¬ 
thest limit. 

She withdrew her hands quickly. Turning, she 
made her way back to the throne, and sat on the 
steps. 

“Come,” she said, making a place beside her. 
“I wish to ask you if you and your companion 
can be of any aid to this poor country in its pres¬ 
ent plight.” 

“We shall do our best to save the country,” 
was my response, “and I believe that success will 
attend our efforts. The professor is now engaged 
in the work. Griffyn and Pollock are with him.” 

“Nothing can be done,” she declared, with 
spirit, “until this elixir is destroyed to the last 
drop! I have given orders for the burning of 
the building in which it is made.” 

“The professor countermanded your orders.” 



264 


A Perilous Attachment . 


Her eyes flashed. 

“Why?” she asked imperiously. 

“Because, although it has been the means of 
bringing woe and unhappiness to Nyll, it may yet 
be employed in saving the country. The elixir 
is a good servant, but a bad master.” 

“How may the elixir be employed?” 

“Let the Churs partake of it, and it will render 
them helpless. Then the Nyllites may rise, com 
quer the savages-” 

“And resume their use of the elixir,” she inter¬ 
rupted sorrowfully. 

“No. After the Churs have been conquered* 
then burn the distillery, and let every keese of 
the elixir be poured orx the ground.” 

She clapped her hands, and a joyful look over¬ 
spread her face. But the joy was short-lived. 

“And then,” she resumed, “the king will order 
the other strangers to build a new distillery, as 
they call it, and they will have to comply in order 
to save their lives.” 

Princess,” I returned, “our poor lives have 
been the cause of all this misery. Had the pro¬ 
fessor and I not valued our existence so highly. 



A Perilous Attachment. 


265 

the king would never have tasted the contents 
of that first flask, nor would the second flask 
have been given him, nor would the distillery 
have been built. Are you sure he will demand 
more of the elixir when he recovers reason and 
sees what direful consequences have followed its 
use?” 

“The taste is strong upon him,” she answered. 
“He drinks the brown fluid continually. I am 
sure he will order more of it.” 

“In that event,” said 1 grimly, “Griffyn, Pol-' 
lock, the professor, and I must leave the coun¬ 
try.” 

“Where will you go?” she asked tremulously. 

“Back to our own land." 

“Beyond the ice wall ?” Her hand crept toward 
mine arjd caught it clingingly. 

“Yes.” 

“Will there not be danger in the attempt? 

“I suppose so,” was my glum rejoindei. 

“Will you not dread to face it?” 

Her cheek was close to mine, her starry eyes 
fixed upon my own and burning with a light that 
thrilled me. 



266 


A Perilous Attachment . 


I placed my other hand about her waist. 

“I shall dread facing the danger much less than 
leaving the Princess Ylma!” 

She sighed. 

“Tell me of your own country/’ she said. “Is 
it a wonderful land like ours?” 

“In some ways more wonderful, but in others 
less so. We have no gorr plates, no oyd cars, 
no kings, no princesses; but we have our Ziffs, 
many of them, and all fully as terrible as the 
one we have lately seen.” 

“Do they not destroy the minds of the people?” 

“The brown fluid does that; then come the 
Ziffs.” 

“Does the Ziff bring his Churs?” 

“We have no Churs, princess. Every man is 
his own Chur. These shaggy monsters skulk in 
the trail of the brown fluid, and battle with the 
man s better self until the Ziff comes and finishes 
the work.” 

She shuddered. 

I should not like your country,” she said. 

Only* if you were there, even such a land might 
be paradise for me!” 



A Perilous Attachment . 


267 

The words were still on her lips as I plucked 
the last one with a kiss. 

“You scoundrel!” 

Count Zylox! The princess pushed from me 
with a little cry, and we both looked up, to find 
the captain of the guard regarding us with a 
scowl. 

I arose haughtily. 

“I cannot forget that I am in the presence 
of a lady,” said I, “or I should answer your speech 
in kind. Eavesdroppers rarely hear anything to 
itheir liking.” 

“You introduce a curse into the land,” sneered 
the count, “and after destroying the people you 
attempt the destruction of the king's only daugh¬ 
ter, so-” 

“Liar!” I cried. 

His base insinuations were too much for my 
hot blood. I launched myself toward him, and, 
had not the princess interfered, would have 
taught him a lesson then and there. 

The king's daughter was between us. My 
hands fell, and I stepped back. 

‘Your pardon, Princess Ylma,” I murmured. 



268 


A Perilous Attachment , 


“At some other time and in some other place he 
shall yield me satisfaction for his words/’ 

“He shall not!” she returned, a very queen in 
speech and bearing. “You shall prove your man¬ 
hood by ignoring 1 a man who forgets himself as 
Count Zylox has done.” 

She faced the count. 

“I desire you to leave this room. There aie 
other things to command your attention at the 
present moment/' 

“Nothing more important than this,” he an¬ 
swered. 

She bent her eyes upon his steadily. 

“Withdraw!“ she commanded. 

For the first time, I saw that the count had 
-the shotgun in his hands. 

“Let him first give me that weapon, Princess 
Ylma/’ I requested. 

Take it!, said the count savagely, and flung 
it with all the force of his left arm down on the 
tiles. 

The piece was broken beyond repair. My heart 
sank, for I had counted on using the gun in 
defense of the palace, should we be attacked. 



A Perilous Attachment . 


269 


As the count turned on his heel, a loud com¬ 
motion was heard at the palace entrance. He 
hurried away, and I started to follow. 

“Promise me before you go,” said Princess 
Ylma, “that you will not renew this quarrel.” 

“I promise,” said I, and hastened on. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

THE PALACE DUNGEON. 

We were unnecessarily alarmed by the noise on 
[the palace steps. The Great Ziff had not re¬ 
turned with the Churs; but Pollock had come 
with an oyd car and a tank of elixir. 

He reported that Prebble, Griffyn, and himself 
had started in different directions through the 
kingdom, each with a car containing a large quan¬ 
tity of the “brown fluid/’ 

This was being judiciously distributed among 
the Churs. 

“They are wild after the stuff,” said Pollock, 
“and are casting aside their loot, their shields, 
and spears, and even allowing their prisoners 
to escape, so that they may drink more and more 
of the fire water, fn twenty-four hours, if the 
Nyllites will rise, Nyll will be theirs once more/’ 

Pollock left, after being reassured as to the 
safety of the king and the princess. I ran back 
to the throne room to acquaint the princess with 



The Palace Dungeon . 


271 

the progress of the good work, but the apartment 
was deserted. 

Since there was rlo danger to threaten, I threw 
myself down in one of the' reclining rooms to 
rest after the exciting events of the last few 
hours. Worn out, I fell asleep. 

When I awoke I was not in the reclining room. 
All around me was blackest darkness, and a dank 
smell as from moldy walls. 

What had happened to me ? I dashed my hand 
across my face to free my brain from the evil 
spell that seemed to encompass it. 

Still the darkness would not lift. Was I mad? 
I reached out on either side. On my right, space, 
on my left, a blank, slippery wall. 

I felt below- I was lying on a slab of stone. 

Staggering erect, I groped my way aimlessly 
about. Presently I came to another wall. 

Turning, I paced to the wall opposite. Twenty 
paces. .Between walls, the other way, I also 
counted twenty paces. 

Then I climbed upon the block of stone and 
reached upward, my fingers touching the roof. 
Under me, around, above, nothing but granite. 



272 


The Palace Dungeon. 


Sitting down on the slab, I bowed my head 
in my hands. I was a prisoner, there was no 
doubt of that. 

But how had -they been able to carry me off 
without waking me? I am not a heavy sleeper, 
and the croon of a rope through an oil sheave 
has more than once sent me from my bunk. 

I smelled an odor strange to my nostrils. Ah, 
I had been drugged! 

Resistance was feared, and these men, who 
were wide awake for six months of the year, 
had taken advantage of me in my sleep, and 
drugged and imprisoned me. 

It was Zylox, of course. He had seen me with 
the princess, had heard our conversation, and it 
had increased his enmity toward me. 

He was a brave man, and had the good of 
the kingdom at heart. But brave men are weak¬ 
est when struck on the side of their affections. 

He loved the princess, and she cared nothing 
for him. He would not brook interference on 
my part, and death was to be my portion. 

I wondered how long an interval had passed 
since I lay down in the reclining room. I also 



The Palace Dungeon. 


2 73 


thought of Prebblc, and wondered if he had suc¬ 
ceeded in saving the kingdom. 

What would he do vtdien he heard that I was 
a prisoner? What could he do? 

Possibly he would not hear. No doubt I was 
in the stronghold of Count Zylox, where I could 
be dealt with at my enemy’s pleasure. 

And the princess! Would she ever know r my 
fate ? 

As I sat there with bowed head, a door opened 
raspingly, and light struck across the gloom. [ 
looked up and saw the count entering, accom¬ 
panied by four armed Churs. 

I sprang erect and rushed toward him, but 
two spears crossed in front of my breast and 
stayed me. 

“Keep your distance, said the count. 

“Is there a spark of honor or manhood about 
you?" I cried. “Will you not grant me the satis¬ 
faction one gentleman may yield another, face 
to face?” 

“I would not soil my hands fighting with you." 

“Coward!’’ 

He smiled. 



The Palace Dungeon. 

“A caged rat may rage at a lion,” said he 
coolly. 

“Where am I?” 

“In a dungeon of the king’s palace.” 

“Why am I here?” 

“For lese majesty.” 

“High treason!” I exclaimed. “A trumped-up 
charge, Zylox. No stranger in the country can 
commit treason.” 

“No; but he can do worse and plan odious 
things.” 

I trembled with anger. 

“It is not the part of a brave man to taunt a 
prisoner unable to defend himself,” said I. 

“Then don’t force me with your questions.” 

“Does the king know I am here ?” 

“You are here by his orders.” 

“Then you have poisoned his mind against 
me.” 

“I have simply told him the truth, and he has 
drawn his own conclusions.” 

“What is to be done with me?” 

“What should have been done when you and 



275 


The Palace Dungeon. 

your comrade first showed yourselves in the 
land.” He added laconically: “Death by oyd.” 

I sank down on the stone slab. 

“When?” I asked, after a moment. 

“In two hours.” 

“Where?” 

“Here in this cell.” 

My impending doom, strange as it may seem, 
had a quieting effect upon my nerves. 

“What of the kingdom?” I asked. 

“It survives, and will live to the end of time 
under the reign of the Almik-Boazars. The 
Churs are all enslaved, and the Great Ziff has 
fled to the Unknown.” 

“Heaven be praised for that! The professor 
was successful in his attempt to save the land. 

“The weapon that wrought the havoc was 
turned upon out foes. Small credit to this pro¬ 
fessor of yours! He and you introduced the 
evil, so it was his business to stamp it out if he 
could.” 

“He is safe?” I asked. 

“Yes, he and the other two. They will be

276 

given safe conduct to the ice wall. If they re¬ 
turn to the country your fate will be theirs/ 

“Leave me in peace/' said I. 

“Will you have more peace with a light?” he 
sneered. “I have brought you one.” 

One of the slaves carried two luminous globes. 
At a signal from the count he laid one of the 
globes on the floor. 

“Two hours/’ said Zylox, with a grim laugh, 
and passed out with his attendants. 

The door was secured* and again I*" was left 
alone. The light, however, made my situation 
more endurable. 

Even when confronted by death, a man’s mind 
.will deal with trivial things. I marveled at the 
luminous globe, for it was not fed with oil, nor 
had it a wick. 

It resembled a sphere of glass, but if it was 
glass it was the first specimen of it I had seen 
in Nyll. I walked to the globe, bent over it, 
and picked it up. 

Something white lay under it. Hastily I put 
down the globe, and possessed myself of the ob¬ 
ject.

m 


It was a bit of folded linen. I unfolded it, 
and found that it bore queer marks upon its sur¬ 
face, made with a yellow pigment. 

Long and earnestly I studied the marks, but 
could make nothing of them. I turned the square 
of linen upside down, and still the characters 
were not legible. 

Suddenly a thought struck me, and I removed 
the talk ring. I had found the key to the situa¬ 
tion, for the words were written in English, 
and, of course, I could not read them while think¬ 
ing in Nyll. 

“Keep a stiff upper lip, captain, \ our friends 
have not abandoned you. I will be with you pres- 
lently.” 

The note was unsigned, but I knew it must 
come from Prebblc. Ihe light bearer had been 
bribed to lay down the note with the luminous 
globe. 

Hope revived in my breast, although, for the 
life of me, I could not understand how getting 
out of the dungeon would save me from my 
impending doom.

The Palace Dungeon . 


After escaping from the palace, I would still 
have to leave the kingdom, and to do that unseen, 
in the broad glare of that long day, would be im¬ 
possible. 

For some time I continued to rack my brain 
with doubts. Then again came the creak of the 
door, and Prebble stood before me. 

He, also, was claddn a new tunic, and through 
the lenses of his spectacles his eyes beamed en¬ 
couragingly. I rushed to him and caught him 
by both hands. 

“Prebble!” I exclaimed. “How have you man¬ 
aged to come to me?” 

‘Lord Nylis requested it of the king as a per¬ 
sonal favor,” he answered. 

“The king is determined on my death?” 

“He is adamant.” 

If that flask of bourbon is to be blamed for 
it, it is strange the rest of you are not here 
with me.” 

It is not on account of the flask of bourbon, 
captain. The rest of us have not dared to make 
love to Princess Ylma.”

“Then, as I expected, Zylox is the moving force 
against me. 7 ’ 

Not only Zylox, but the whole kingdom—ex¬ 
cept Lord Nylis. He regrets the occurrence, but 
you have made him your friend, and he stands 
by you.” 

“What of the princess?” I smiled. 

“She stands by you, too, and there have been 
/Stoimy times in the palace, the princess entreat¬ 
ing her father to spare you, and her father only 
wishing you had nine lives, like a cat, so he could 
take them all. You have committed a very hei¬ 
nous offense, captain.” 

“I could not help it; nor would I have helped 
it if I could.” 

“That’s like you. But I must not squander any¬ 
thing so valuable as time at the present mo¬ 
ment. Plans have been made to rescue you.” 

“To get me out of the palace?” 

“Yes.” 

“What will they avail? Suppose I do get out 
of the palace, what then? Must I hide myself 
somewhere until the long night, while all Nyll 
sleeps ?”

“Hardly. Griffyn has constructed a new bal¬ 
loon--” 

“Constructed a balloon?” I gasped. 

“That is it. He has made it out of a royal cloth 
woven from thread spun by spiders. Griffyn has 
really done remarkably well. The structure used 
as a distillery formed his workroom, and, while 
he was ostensibly assisting Pollock in the manu¬ 
facture of spirits, he was really constructing this 
airship. 

“He utilized what materials he could take from 
the wreck of the old balloon, and the result is 
most creditable. The bag is now being inflated 
in an open space near where the distillery used 
to be. 

“The gin mill has been burned to the ground, 
you know, and there is not a drop of elixir to 
be had anywhere in the kingdom.” 

“Will Griffyn, feeling as he does toward us, 
take us with him?” I inquired doubtfully. 

“Misfortune has drawn us all together, cap¬ 
tain, and Griffyn’s feelings toward you have un¬ 
dergone a change. Besides, I insured our 
sage in the agreement.” 


oas—

“What agreement ?” 

“A balloon is not of much use without gas. 
Griffyn could make the balloon, but he could not 
make the gas. I have done that in return for 
the privilege of our being allowed to go with 
him in the airship.” 

“And the balloon is being inflated, you say?” 

“It will be ready for use by the time we arc 
ready to use it.” 

“But I am to meet my fate within two hours!” 

He laughed. 

“So you are, but not in the way you imagine. 
Now listen, captain: Shortly after I leave, a 
slave will come to you with food. When he goes 
out, you will accompany him. He understands, 
and there will be no trouble. 

“When you part from the Chur some one else 
will take you in charge. That is all. It is thought 
that I have come to say good-by to you, so I must 
not linger too long, or suspicion will be aroused.” 

“I will do everything I am told to do, said I, 
guessing Prebble’s hand. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 


FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM. 

Prebble went away, and I paced the confines 
of the dungeon impatiently while waiting for 
the Chur with whom I was to depart. He ca^ne 
in due course, nervous to a degree, and fright¬ 
ened almost out of his wits by the part he was 
playing. 

Through damp and tortuous underground 
passages I was conducted until it seemed as 
though we had traversed several miles of laby¬ 
rinth. When we reached the end we were at a 
flight of stone steps leading-upward. 

The Chur ascended the steps and pushed at 
an iron door. After some effort he succeeded 
in throwing the door open, and daylight pene¬ 
trated the gloom. 

As the slave stood on the topmost step I saw 
hands 1 each over and lay a golden chain around 
his neck. His face quivered with joy, and he 
kissed the hands before they were withdrawn. 



Fighting for Freedom. 


283 

Then he beckoned me, and stood aside while I 
passed up and out. 

The exit let me out of doors. A grove stretched 
around me, and I could see no one, not even the 
person who had conferred the gold necklace upon 
the Chur. 

I turned to question the slave by signs, but 
he had disappeared. Earth covered the spot 
where I had gained the surface from below, and 
so nicely was the door fitted into the turf 'that no 
eye could detect its presence. 

As I stood waiting I heard a soft voice: 

‘"Captain!” 

Behind me stood Princess Ylma, having just 
stepped out from among the trees. I hurried to 
he^ caught her in my arms, and pressed my lips 
to hers. 

“I was not expecting you, Ylma,-' I said. 

“Did you think I would abandon you?” she 
returned, a surprised look on her face. 

“No, no—not that. I was sure you could do 
nothing. The professor, in fact, told me how 
hard you had labored with the king, and how un¬ 
successful you were.” 



Fighting for Freedom. 

“My father was very unkind to me/’ she said, 
with trembling lip. “He does not appreciate what 
you and the professor have done for the king¬ 
dom.” 

“We wrought the evil, Ylma, and it was our 
duty to repair it as well as we could. His majesty 
owes us nothing on that score. But where are 
we? Had I not better be hastening to the air¬ 
ship?” 

“Are you so anxious to leave me, then?” she 
pouted. 

“I wish that I might never leave you!” I an¬ 
swered fervently, “I am forsaking Nyll for the 
good of the kingdom, Ylma! You understand. 
We talked of it in the throne room.” 

“I understand,” said she, with mock pathos, 
“that I would not abandon you, but that you 
willingly abandon me. How. ungrateful, cap¬ 
tain!” 

“Not willingly, dearest,” I insisted. “You 
would not have me stay when all the people, ex¬ 
cept yourself and Lord Nylis, are crying for my 
blood because——” I hesitated. 



Fighting for Freedom . 


285 

Because, she finished, “you have dared to 
love the princess!” 

“Yes,” I proceeded. “And I would willingly 
barter one hour of happiness with the princess 
for this death -by oyd. If you say so, dear 
one-” 

“No, no!” she whispered, placing one small 
hand over my lips. “I do not say so. Forgive 
me if I tease you, captain. These are the palace 
gardens, and we are not more than a stone's 
throw from the lake where I saved your life, so 
many, many hours ago. Lord Nylis is coming 
for us with an oyd car, and we are to remain here 
and listen for his signal. Until we hear the sig¬ 
nal w r e may talk.” 

“I hope the signal will be long in coming,” said 
I, as she led me to a stone seat. “You realize, 
do you not, that we are parting forever?” 

“No,” she returned. “I cannot realize it, cap¬ 
tain.” 

“You must realize it, Ylma,” I persisted. “It 
Will be beyond my power to return here. I trust 
the sacrifice I am making for this kingdom will 



286 Fighting for Freedom « 

long be remembered. It is costing me more than 
I can tell you.” 

“Then why make the sacrifice, captain?” she 
murmured, leaning against me and looking up 
into my eyes. 

Her mood perplexed me. There was no under¬ 
standing her. 

“There must be a sacrifice, Ylma, whatever I 
do,” said I. “If I leave the country, I sacrifice 
you; if I remain, J yield up my life. I will do 
as you tell me, my princess. Shall I go, or stay ?” 

“You must neither leave me nor remain here,” 
said she enigmatically. 

Then she laughed in my bewildered face. 

“Is this airship of yours, captain, unable to 
carry one more? Why may not Princess Ylma 
go with you?” 

“Ylma!” I cried, and caught her to my breast. 
“You would leave your kingdom, your father, all 
'for me?” 

“My happiness lies with you, dear,” she an¬ 
swered simply. “If I remained here I should be 
unhappy. Your people shall be my people, your; 
country my country.” 



Figfiting for Freedom . 287 

“It is you, then, who are making the sacrifice,” 
said I fondly. 

“Neither of us shall make a sacrifice, ,, she 
replied. “Do you not know that I am promised 
to Count Zylox, a man I loathe and abhor ? My 
father has a will of iron, and is determined to 
unite the two royal houses of Nyll. 

“You are to be slain, and, immediately after¬ 
ward, while your blood is still red on the count’s 
hands, our nuptials are to be celebrated. Can 
you imagine a^more horrible fate? By leaving 
my country with you I shall be the happiest 
woman in the world. ” 

Life was bright for me then. Not only had I 
discovered the North Pole, but I had won a 
bride, the fairest and most lovable of women. 

While we sat there and talked a voice called 
from a distance. 

“His lordship!” exclaimed Ylma, starting to 
her feet. “Come!” she added, catching my hand. 
"Lord Nylis is taking desperate chances to aid 
us. The Chur who brought you through the 
underground passages to the grove won his 



288 


Fighting for Freedom . 


dom; but we can only requite Lord Nylis by giv¬ 
ing him our love and gratitude.” 

Together we hurried toward the road. As we 
pushed through the bushes we saw an oyd car 
drawn up and waiting for us. 

The car contained but one passenger, who, 
muffled to the eyes in a white robe, sat in the 
driver’s seat. 

"Is the coast clear, your lordship?” I asked. 

He nodded. 

"What you are doing for us in this hour,” I 
went on, "I shall never forget!” 

I was standing beside the oyd car, assisting 
Ylma to mount. Suddenly the muffled figure up¬ 
rose and cast aside the cloak. 

It was not Lord Nylis at all, but Zylox. Ylma 
screamed, and the count struck at me savagely 
with a short sword. 

"Don’t forget!” he cried. "Up, Churs! This 
way, guard!” 

The captain of the guard had every advantage, 
and it is a wonder he did not cleave me to the 
chin with his sword. Ylma dropped on the seat 



Fighting for Freedom. 2g? 

of the oyd car, and I jumped back, the sword 
grazing my arm. 

Meantime the Churs began pouring into the 
road from among the trees before and behind 
the car. Zylox, baffled in his attempt to cut me 
down, stood looking at me, the sword in his left 
hand. 

“Well it was/' he shouted, “that we discovered 
the plot of Lord Nylis to help you! But you 
are not out of the country yet, and you shall 
not leave this spot alive!” 

In the breast of my tunic was the little silver 
box with the gorr plate sent to me, in the land 
of the Churs, by Princess Ylma. I treasured 
it above diamonds and rubies, but I saw immedi¬ 
ately that I must part with it. 

Drawing it forth I poised it a second in my 
hands, and then hurled it at the count. It struck 
him in the forehead, and he threw up his hands 
and fell backward from the car. 

The sword left his grasp and dropped clatter¬ 
ing into the roadway. I secured it in a Hash, 
leaped aboard the car, drew up the screen, and 



290 Fighting for Freedom . 

wielded the tiller with my left hand and the 
sword with my right. 

Like an arrow from a bowstring we darted 
away, mowing a swath through the ranks of 
the Churs. Leaning over the forward point of 
the vehicle, I slashed furiously with the blade. 

In almost less time than it takes to tell of it 
we had left Zylox and his detachment of the 
guard far behind. 

“This is awful, awful!” moaned Ylma. 

“If we could have helped it, Ylma,” I answered, 
“I would have been happy. The count discov¬ 
ered your plans in some way and took his lord¬ 
ship’s place in the oyd car.” 

“There are several cars pursuing us,” said my 
companion. 

“Have we far to go?” I asked, drawing out 
the screen and giving the car more speed. 

Only a little way. There! Ahead of us is 
the airship.” 

A low hill, bare of trees, lay directly before 
us. On the crest of the hill arose the four ruined 
walls of Pollock’s distillery, and near the walls 
was the huge, swaying bulk of the balloon. 



'Fighting for Freedom . 


291 


In the sunlight the great globe looked like 
frosted silver. About the basket I could see the 
forms of Prebble, Griffyn, and Pollock looking 
down on us with frantically waving arms. 

What was the matter with them, I was asking 
myself. Certainly the mere excitement attending 
our flight and pursuit could not cause such strange 
actions on their part. 

Presently the road angled to the right, and 
when we dashed around we came upon six oyd 
cars drawn up abreast of each other across our 
path. 

There was no getting between the cars, and 
no swerving to right or left to pass them. Thick 
woods flanked each side of the way. 

In order to avoid a wreck, I was forced to 

draw to a halt. 

“In the name of the king!” shouted a voice, 
as a man arose in one of the cars that con¬ 
fronted us. 

The whir and rumble of the other cars could 
be heard advancing upon us from behind. 

“Lost!” exclaimed Ylma, in a heartbreaking 
tone. “All is lost, captain!” 



CHAPTER XXVII. 

A BEWILDERING SENSATION. 

In that dread moment when, as Ylma said, all 
seemed lost, I cast a quick look upward toward 
the hilltop, where the balloon was swaying. Preb- 
ble was executing a war dance and pointing with 
his hand toward the roadside. 

I understood then that we were to leave the car 
and take to the woods. 

“Not lost, Ylma!” I panted, springing to the 
ground, the sword gripped tightly in my right 
hand. “Come! We will gain the hill if Heaven 
so wills it, or I shall die making the attempt.” 

Pier courage rose grandly to the occasion, and 
she leaped lightly to my side. 

“Do you think there is hope?” she asked. 

“While there is life there is always hope!” 

With hands clasped we hurried into the deep 
shadow of the woods. We were within spear 
throw, but none of the ugly darts was launched 
at us. 

Me they were willing enough to spear, but the 



A Lczeildcnng Sensation . )( ^ 

princess w as at my side, and none dared risk a 
throw'. 

“Follow them!” ordered a voice. “Rescue the 
piincess not a hair of her head must be in¬ 
jured but slay the foreign devil—slay him!” 

Slay the foreign devil! Slay him!” shouted 
other voices. 

“Faster, faster!” panted Ylma. "Oh, captain, 
can’t you go faster?” 

I was running my best, and dragging her after 
me. She was sobbing breathlessly, but urging 
me to swifter pace at every bound. 

From behind us came a triumphant cry. I 
paused, turned, and saw that a Chur had over¬ 
taken us. Warding a spear thrust w ith one hand, 

I passed the sword through his body, and whirled 
to renew' our flight. 

Ylma, overcome with fear and fatigue, had 
fallen. 

“I can go no farther, captain,” she cried; throw¬ 
ing her arms around my neck convulsively. 
“Leave me! Save yourself!” 

“If I go, Ylma,” I answered, “you go, with 



294 


A Bewildering Sensation. 


Then I picked her up in my arms and ran on 
blindly. We were ascending the hill now. There 
was no timber, and we were in plain view of our 
pursuers. 

But still no spears were thrown—the danger to 
the princess was too great. A hundred yards 
more and we would be at the balloon. 

Could I make it? The Churs were bounding 
up the hillside from rock to rock, coming closer 
and closer at every spring. 

The sweat stood out on my forehead in great 
drops, my heart pounded furiously, and I could 
hear the roar of rushing blood in my ears. An¬ 
other of the Churs was right at my heels. 

Then I perceived that Griffyn and Pollock were 
beside me. A lusty right-hander from Pollock 
laid the Chur in his tracks. 

“Let me help you, captain,” said Griffyn. 

Between us we bore Ylma the remaining dis¬ 
tance, and placed her in the basket. 

“In with you!” cried Prebble. “For Heaven’s 
sake, hurry!” 

The professor was standing on the rim of the 



A Bewildering Sensation. 


2 95 


basket, knife in hand, waiting to cut the rope 
that held the balloon to earth. 

I was thrown into the basket by Griffyn, who 
piled in after me. Prebble cut the rope, and we 
shot skyward, with Pollock clinging to the edge 
of the car. 

I looked over and downward. Nyll and the 
Nyllites were receding rapidly. As I gazed, the 
Churs hurled an impotent shower of spears, which' 
fell far short of us. 

Zylox was below, and his was the last face I 
saw. Its expression of hate and baffled rage was 
awful to behold. As his figure faded and blurred 
on my sight he was shaking his fist upward at 
the mounting airship. 

“Saved!” cried Prebble jubilantly. ‘ I told you 
that when you left the dungeon, captain, you 
.would meet your fate.” 

Ylma smiled and held out her hand to me. 

“I did not think of your words in this light,” 
said I, taking the little hand in mine. 

“I think the lot of us have had a time of it,” 

said Grififya 



2 C)6 A Bezvildering Sensation . 

“So we have, my hearty,” I returned, “but all’s 
well that ends well.” 

“May I look over, captain?” asked Ylma. 

“Certainly you may,” said I, and I held my 
arm about her while she took a final look at her 
country and her people. 

When she turned to me a moment later there 
was a smile of joy on her lips and tears of sorrow 
in her eyes. 

“The wind favors our return southward,” said 
Griffyn. “If nothing unforeseen happens we 
shall reach the land beyond the ice wall before 
the-” 

Griffyn paused. He could not calculate the 
length of time that would be required for cross¬ 
ing the kingdom and the frozen plains beyond, 

“I can make no guess about the length of time 
necessary to place us in comfort and safety,” 
said he, “but the present breeze seems to be as 
strong, or stronger, than the wind that carried 
us north.” 

“How many hours were you in the air on the 
other occasion?” inquired Prebble. 

“It was twenty-five hours, professor, from the 



A Bewildering Sensation . 


297 


time we left the spot where the balloon was in¬ 
flated until Pollock and I landed in the para¬ 
chute.” 

/‘Then by to-morrow, if this wind holds, and 
nothing goes wrong with the gas bag, we should 
be among the Eskimo settlements,*’ said I. 

“Yes,” nodded Griffyn. “I don't think any¬ 
thing will go wrong with the balloon. It has 
been strongly constructed, and if the professor 
has furnished us with a good brand of gas we 
should make a landfall safely and quickly/’ 

“You and the professor have done exceedingly 
well, Griffyn,” said I approvingly. 

The Englishman laughed. 

“Our lives depended on our efforts, and you 
may be sure that we labored like a lot of bally 
slaves. We tried to think of everything— food, 
water, ballast, and good, warm clothing against 
our passage over the ice fields. 

I had not had time, as yet, to note the equip¬ 
ment of the car. Now, however, I took occasion 
to look around me, and found that we were snugly 


ensconced among many packages. 
“J regret exceedingly, ’ said I, 


“that we were 



2 g8 A Bewildering Sensation . 

obliged to resort to so much violence in getting 
away.” 

“The Nyllites and the Churs got their whack,” 
returned Griffyn easily. “Our lives were at 
# stake, Salis, and we could not be expected to 
stand on ceremony.” His voice took on a note 
of reproach as he added: “Your affection for the 
princess was hardly wise. But for that there 
would have been no violence and no trouble.” 

“You will kindly leave the princess out of the 
question,” I answered him sharply. 

“I maintain, however,” said he steadily, “that 
it is well that we left your princess behind.” 

“What’s that?” I demanded, thinking I had not 
heard aright. 

“It would have been a calamity for all con¬ 
cerned had you brought Princess Ylma away with 
you. Nyll is her home, and the Nyllites are her 
people. She would not thrive in a foreign land, 
and to spirit her away was hardly the fair thing 
for the kingdom.” 

I stared at the man. He could talk in that 
inexplicable strain with the princess in the car 
with us! 



A Bewildering Sensation. „„ fl 

^yy 

From him I turned to the professor. 

My dear captain, said Prebble commiserat- 
ingly, “I am quite of Griffyn’s opinion. AVe did 
well to leave Princess Ylma behind. She was 
unhurt, in spite of the violent scenes you both 
passed through, and, let us hope, she will soon 
forget you, and turn a more favoring eye upon 
Zylox.” 

I turned to look toward the place where the 
princess—my princess—was standing. She 
smiled brightly at me, and I whirled upon the 
professor and Griffyn. 

“Are you mad?” I shouted. “Or am I? You 
talk of leaving the princess behind when she 
is here with us, in plain view of all of you. 
Speak, Ylma!” I asked, looking around at her. 

“It is quite true, captain,” Ylma answered 
softly. “I am with you, and shall always be 
with you.” 

“There!” I exclaimed triumphantly. 

Griffyn and Prebble merely smiled at me— 
smiled tolerantly and kindly. 

“I trust with all my heart,” said Prebble, "that 
no ill will come to Nylis for the aid he gave as.’' 



300 A Bewildering Sensation, 

“He has powerful friends at court/’ spoke up 
the princess, “and his lordship cannot be harmed. M 

To my anger and surprise, no one in the car, 
aside from myself, paid any attention to the 
princess’ words. 

I began to experience a bewildering sensation, 
a sensation which filled me with an astonishment 
that remains even to this day. 

I stepped to the side of Ylma, I spoke to her, 
I tried to touch her with my hand. Where she 
had stood, she was not; the words I addressed 
to her received no answer; the hand I put forth 
touched only space. 

“Where is she?” I shouted angrily. “What 
have you done with her? Griffyn! Prebble! 
What has become of Princess Ylma?” 

I was angry, for I felt that some trick had 
been played upon me. In my bewilderment and 
wrath I laid hands upon Griffyn. Instantly he, 
and Prebble, and Pollock seized me in a fierce 
grip, and while the car swayed with the struggle 
I was borne down upon the bales and packages, 
doubled up in the confined space, and held by 
sheer force. 



A Bewildering Sensation. 


3p i 

Was I the victim of a plot? What plot could 
there be in which Prebble, always loyal, could 
take part against me? 

Suddenly a weight seemed lifted. Something 
snapped in my brain, or else the two ends of a 
mental chain were reunited with a flashing as of 
live wires. 

My anger fell from me, and my lifted hands 
dropped nerveless. 

“What are you men trying to do?” I inquired. 

“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Prebble. “He 
will be all right now, Griffyn. Let him sleep.” 

And, somehow, I did sleep. 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 


CONCLUSION. 

I have now come to a part of this chronicle 
which has always been a mystery to me. The 
events surrounding the escape from the Land of 
Nyll, and especially those which have to do with 
the princess at that time, have faded into the 
wrack left by a weird—and, in many respects, a 
delightful—dream. 

When I opened my eyes, after falling asleep 
in the car, I experienced a disagreeable feeling 
of cold and discomfort. Griffyn, Prebble, and 
Pollock, swathed in heavy garments, were releas¬ 
ing bags of ballast with their mittened hands. 

“Have we ballast enough ?” I heard Prebble 
inquire. 

“I think so, professor,” Griffyn answered. 
“You see, I had counted upon the effect the frigid 
air over the ice fields would have, on the gas in 
the envelope. The only way to counteract the 
loss of buoyancy was by hurling ballast out of

the car. Therefore, I made the balloon large and 
equipped it with plenty of sandbags.” 

“Where is the princess?” I demanded, sit¬ 
ting up. 

Pollock had as little interest in me as I had 
in him. He kept to his work without paying 
the slightest attention. Griffyn and Prebble, how¬ 
ever, faced around and gave me encouraging 
smiles. 

“If you don't feel warm enough, captain,” said 
Prebble, wrap another bearskin around you. 
This climate is vastly different from that of 
Nyll.” 

“But where is the princess ?” I persisted. 
“Safely in the palace, I make 110 doubt, and I 
hope there is peace between her and her father, 
and that Count Zylox is finding favor. He is 
a worthy gentleman, in spite of the fact that we 
had our differences, and he deserves the best of 
fortune.” 

I looked around the car, confused and wonder¬ 
ing. 

“I knocked Zylox off his lordship’s car with the 
gorr plate,” I observed. “That was when we 



3°4 


Conclusion, 


found him waiting for us instead of Lord Nylis. 
It was no insignificant blow, I can tell you.” 

The professor cackled. 

“Then, captain, you have left with him a. me¬ 
mento,” said he. “Probably he will not treas¬ 
ure it.” 

“Will you not tell me what has become of the 
princess?” I begged, passing a mittened hand over 
my brows. 

“You remember bounding up the rocks, carry¬ 
ing Princess Ylma in your arms?” asked the pro¬ 
fessor. 

“I remember that, yes,” I answered eagerly. 

“And do you remember that Griffyn and Pol¬ 
lock came to your rescue just as a Chur had 
knocked you flat with a blow from behind?” 

“I remember about Griffyn and Pollock, but I 
was not struck down by the Chur.” 

Blank astonishment crossed the professor’s 
face. I proceeded to recite the progress of events 
from that point. 

“It was Pollock who bowled over the Chur. 
Then Griffyn helped me carry Ylma to the bal¬ 
loon, and we placed her in the basket. We turn-

bled in after her, \ou, Prebble, were standing 
on the rim of the basket, a knife in vour hand, 
and the moment we were all aboard you slashed 
a rope in twain, and the balloon sailed away into 
space. The Churs flung a shower of spears aficr 
-us, but they fell short. Zylox was below, and 
his face was the last one I saw that I can dis¬ 
tinctly remember. Ylma was with us—there can 
be no doubt on that score. She wanted to take 
a final look at the Kingdom of Nyll as we swept 
over it, and T remember steadying her as she 
peered over the edge of the basket.” 

Pollock had looked around in considerable as¬ 
tonishment. Prebble and Griffyn were exchang¬ 
ing puzzled looks. Prebble’s face was first to 
clear. 

“Why,” said he, with a laugh, “from the mo¬ 
ment Griffyn and Pollock went to your rescue, 
captain, your fancies have been playing weird 
pranks. It proves,” he added jubilantly, “that 
my theory regarding the irresponsible condition 
of the mind north of the arctic circle is correct.” 

“You mean to say,” I cried protestingly, that

I imagined all that about my escape with the 
princess?” 

“Exactly that,” said Prebble. “What really 
happened, captain, is this: We were waiting for 
you at the balloon, and we hardly thought it possi¬ 
ble for you to get clear of your enemies. But 
you did manage to force a way through them by 
leaving the road and taking to the woods. We 
saw you, hard beset, climbing the rocks with the 
princess in your arms. Griffyn and Pollock sal¬ 
lied out to do what they could. Just as they 
reached you, a Chur floored you with a blow. 
You fell, and the princess dropped from your 
arms. Griffyn and Pollock could not bear away 
both you and the princess, so they picked you up 
and carried you to the balloon. You were half 
dazed and wholly irrational. The princess was 
not here, but you insisted on talking to her just’ 
as though she was here. You grew angry when 
we tried to explain, and it was necessary for us 
to use force. While we were holding you down 
you seemed to recover your wits; but the de¬ 
lusion regarding the princess had not been dis-

pelled. I trust I have made that matter clear 

to you now, however.” 

% 

I can t understand it,” I muttered. 

Although I could not understand, yet I was 
forced to accept Prebble’s explanation. Princess 
Ylma was not in the car. This one fact proved 
me in error. 

I would almost as readily think that our ex¬ 
pel iences in the Land of Nyll and among the 
Churs were equally a product of my imagination,” 
said I. 

Not at all,” spoke up Griffyn, “for you have 
the testimony of the rest of us to adduce in 
proof. That blow on the head, dealt by the Chur, 
is what did the business for you, Salis.” 

“I have no recollection of it.” 

“Your head is bandaged. That ought to be 
sufficient proof, even though the hurt is causing 
you no discomfort.” 

I was conscious, then, of a throbbing at the 
back of my head. 

“The joke of it all is,” cackled the professor, 
“that the captain knocked Coiftit Zylox off the oyd 
car with a love letter from the princess. That

letter was impressed in a block of carnelian, and 
weighed a pound.” 

Griffyn smiled, and Pollock laughed outright. 
I leaned back against the framework of the car 
and wondered if I had really recovered my senses. 

My romance with the princess had come to a 
most unsatisfactory conclusion. My heart was 
deeply involved, and the disappointment was bit¬ 
ter. 

Prebble, seeing how hard I took the affair, 
knelt down beside me. 

“Let me assure you, captain,” said he, “that 
it is well the affair ended in this way.” 

I shook my head.' He went on with his rea¬ 
sons: 

“It is best that Princess Ylma should remain 
in her own land, among her own people. Best 
for her, and best for the kingdom. The line of 
the Boazars ends with Ylma. Had we borne the 
princess away the kingdom would indeed have 
had cause to consider us demons of destruction. 
You may find it hard to reconcile yourself to the 
fact now, but in years to come you will be glad 
the matter turned out as it has.” 



Conclusion. 

I kept my head bowed in gloomy silence. 

“Besides,” proceeded Prebble, “we have left 
behind us a few good friends. If the princess 
remains to intercede for them—for Lord Nylis 
particularly—we may console ourselves with a 
well-grounded hope that they will not suffer for 

aiding in our escape. Then there is-” 

wordcame in startled tones from Grif- 

fyn. 

Prebble scrambled to his feet and joined Grif- 
fyn, who was looking excitedly over the rim of 
the basket. Pollock also was containing himself 
only with great difficulty. 

4 ‘Glory!” cried the professor exultantly. 
“Look, captain! See who are below! Some of 
our Eskimo guides, as I live, and with them are 
several of the crew from the ship!'* 

Here was something to take my mind oft* the 
amazing tangle in which it had become involved. 
Scrambling* erect, 1 leaned on the rim of the cai 
and looked down. 

We were perhaps five hundred feet in the air, 
and only maintaining that height by the expendi¬ 
ture of vast quantities of ballast. Below, and a

^o 

little way to the south, were dog sledges, heaped 
high with provisions. Around the sledges were 
the Eskimos, and in front of the leading sledge 
stood the fur-clad men from the ship. I recog- 
nized^Lieutenant Corson, my second in command, 
and Bent nick, our doctor. 

“They are on the way to the ice cap,” said I, 
waving my hand to the startled men below. “After 
the Eskimos got back to the ship Corson lost no 
time in starting out. We’ll make a landing, Grif¬ 
fyn, you and Pollock,” said I. 

I turned to Prebble and gripped his hand. 

“Our dangers are nearly over with, Prebble!” 
said I. “We’ll soon be aboard ship and under 
the flag.” 

“Which puts us a long step toward home!” 
cried the professor delightedly. 

“I wonder where our ship is, Pollock?” asked' 
Griffyn of his secretary. 

“Pleaven knows!” Pollock answered. 

“You are welcome to sail south with us, Grif¬ 
fyn, and you, Pollock,” said I. 

“We accept your offer, Salis,” returned Grif¬ 
fyn heartily. “You may need our testimony to

substantiate your claims. We can help you 
there.” 

He caught the valve cord. Standing at the 
edge of the basket, I watched while we settled 
slowly toward the gleaming plains of white. 

Almost I‘fancied that Princess Ylma was be¬ 
side me, and almost I could hear her voice giving 
its final message: 

“It is quite true, captain; I am with you, and 
shall always be with you.” 

It was a message for me alone, and I treasured 
at as a promise.

NICK CARTER STORIES 


New Magnet Library 

Not a Dull Book in This List 


Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact 
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to 
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced 
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the crea¬ 
tion of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged trium¬ 
phantly from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where 
he should be—behind the bars. 

The author of these stories knew more about writing detective sto¬ 
ries than any other single person. 

Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been 
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of 
them as being fully us interesting as any detective story between cloth 
covers which sells at ten times the price. 

If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New 
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and de¬ 
light you.

Everybody Reads 

The* Street & Smith Novel 

High-brow public opinion has changed radi¬ 
cally during the past few years, so far as 
placing a proper^valuation on -paper-covered 
reading matter is concerned. 

In the old days, anything between paper 
covers was a dime novel and/ therefore, to 
be avoided as cheap and contaminating. 

Since men like Frank O’Brien have pointed 
out to the world the fact that some of the 
best literature in the English language first 
appeared between paper covers, such books 
are welcomed in the best of families. 

The STREET & SMITH NOVELS are 
clean, interesting, and up-to-date. There are 
hundreds of different titles, and we invite your 
careful consideration of them from a stand¬ 
point of value and of literary excellence.
