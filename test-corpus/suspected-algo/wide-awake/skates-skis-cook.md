Skates, Skis, and a Saphead
by

Deeply steeped in gloom perfectly described the condition of young Nixon J. Peters. Loneliness
and bitter regret pervaded his soul as he sat by himself on the rear seat of the flying sleigh
and thought of what might have been. He had reason to believe that he was the best skater and
ski jumper entered in the winter sports contest at Devil's Lake, on the preceding afternoon,
and yet he had lost both main events by an apparent failure to look well to his equipment at
the last moment. Every one had expected that he would blunder somewhere, and so no one was
greatly disappointed; that is no on except Nixon J. Peters.

Almost at the take-off of the jump, one of Nixons's skis had broken. He had taken a wild
header, and landed in a snow bank with heels in the air. A big laugh had been the result. Also,
he had cast a skate at the critical moment of the skating race, and the other contestants had
slit past him, Porter Markham in the lead. This same Porter Markham too had won the ski jump.
Now Porter Markham was on the front seat of the sleigh, driving blithely and exchanging jest
and small talk with Hesther Morton, who sat beside him. Truly, Nixon J. Peters's lines had
fallen in hard places.

Nixon was Nix to those who knew him best. Often he suffered the crowning indignity of being
referred to as the Saphead. He had heard the unlovely nickname applied to him many times while
digging himself out of the snow bank. It had punctuated the merriment released by his sorry
mishap. Hesther Morton had joined in the riot of laughter. Nixon knew this only too well, for
she was the first person he had seen after digging the snow out of his eyes. For Hesther to be
amused at his expense, well, that was something that hurt.

Then, while seeking, with dogged resolution to retrieve himself on the steel runners, a strap
had broken, ad a skate had shot off across the glittering ice. Peters had slipped and slammed
around on the course like a crazy curling stone, finally cutting the feet out from under a fat
spectator, who called him Saphead right to his face! Ah, what a wind-up for a sorry afternoon!
Peters clenched his hands in his bearskin gloves and crouched down on the rear seat in a
fruitless effort to efface himself.

He was nineteen, and Porter Markham was twenty. They both worked for Uncle Silas Goddard, who
had a ranch in Montana, and made a business of sending range horses into North Dakota to be
halter broken and sold to the settlers. Goddard was uncle to all his men, in the sense that
gives an avuncular character to every genial, middle-aged person who looks after the welfare of
younger employees. 

In the early summer, Uncle Silas had sent a hundred horses into North Dakota. Business had not
been good and late fall found half the horses still outhand. These horses were being wintered
at the Morton ranch, on marsh hay, cut and stacked by Peters, Markham, and Reece Bailey, who
had been sent by Uncle Silas to take care of the horse herd. When spring came, there was a
promise of turning off every head of the stock at a good profit.

The winter, so far, had not been particularly lonely for the Montana men. The snows of December
had been light and it had been possible for th horses to paw out considerable forage in the
hills. January, however brought in a good fall of the beautiful and it had been necessary to
corral and shelter the animals and to go extensively into the feeding.

Reese Bailey, Uncle Si's foreman, found time to play cribbage with Lance Morton, Hesther's
Father; and Peters and Nixon acquired leisure for skating and skiing, popular sports at their
home ranch in the Rockies. A river---it would have been a creek in a country of large
streams---flowed through the Morton holdings, and its glassy surface offered a resistless
invitation to the steel runners. As for the skiing, there were plam and hill for running,
climbing, and glissading. While Bailey and Morton were busy at their eternal fifteen-two,
fifteen-four, Peters and Markham were skating or skiing, often with Hesther, who was fond of
both sports. The girl, if appearances were to be believed was rather fond of Markham, also, but
had few smiles to waste on Peters.

In his bashful, blundering way, Peters tried to make himself agreeable to Hesther. He was big
and awkward, however and had tow-colored hair, a slow wit, and a few graces of speech or
manner. His efforts to impress Hesther were overwhelmed by the never failing persiflage and the
rakish dress and carriage of handsome Porter Markham. Markham posessed a confidence in himself
that was sublime, a confidence that shone brilliantly in contrast with clumsy ineffectiveness
of Nixon J. Peters.

Peters realized this and nourished a bitter grudge against his physical and mental
shortcomings. He used to dream of a fire at the ranch, in which he posed as a hero, and bore
the fair Hesther to safety from the ranch house, through a furnace of flames. Then, in his
visions, hi pictured the girl as taking his hand and humbly asking his forgiveness for her
failure to perceive his sterling qualities from the first. During such moments of illusion the
Saphead was almost happy. But the ranch house never took fire, and the chance to prove himself
a hero by rescuing Hesther Morton was denied by fate.

In mid-January however an opportunity presented itself, through the winter sports at Devil's
Lake. Markham and Peters entered themselves in the ski-jumping context and skating race. They
drove the fifty miles which separated Morton's from the lagke and Hesther went with them to see
the carnival of sports and to spend a night or two with relatives in Devil's Lake City. Again
Peters had dreams; but now, on the homeward drive, every hope was shattered and he longed for
for a period of blank obscurity and complete retirement.

He could have declared that one of his skis had been tampered with, and that one of his skate
straps had been all but cut through with the point of a knife. Examination made him sure of
both facts, yet it had not occurred to him to sob. He had blundered in not making certain of
his skis and skates beforehand so he could not see how any one but himself was at fault. As he
crouched in the back seat of the sleigh he considered requesting Uncle Silas Goddard to recall
him to the Montana headquarters. There, at last, he would be rid of Markham and cut off forever
from the demoralizing and disdainful eyes of Hesther. 

Yes, he would go back to the home ranch and he would do this in spite of something which he
knew and which was very important to his future. It was common knowledge that a place of
preferment was to be given by Uncle Silas to either Peters or to Markham--a foremanship at a
newer ranch, with a chance to acquire an interest in the horses and cattle. Reece Bailey was
watching Peters and Markham and on his report Uncle Silas would act. To retire from the North
Dakota venture of the ranchowner now would cut Peters off entirely from promotion, and drop the
plum in Porter Markham's hand. But Peters, in the bitterness of his heart, was allowing nothing
aside form his own peace of mind to influence him. Yes, he would ask Uncle Silas to recall him
to Montana.

"You still there, Nix?" Markham suddenly asked turing to look rearward. Peters grunted.
"You're so blamed quiet," went on Markham, with a laugh, "that I reckoned you might have taken
another header into the snow, back a ways on the trail." Hesther joined in the laugh, and, in
spirit, poor Peters writhed.

The short day was closing, and the sun went down beyond the white horizon in cold glory. They
were five miles form Morton's, and Markham had driven the horses so hard that they were nearly
fagged. They breathed wheezingly and frost coated heaving sides. The place dragged in spite of
Markham's relentless use of the whip.

"Anyhow," spoke up Peters suddenly, "you might think of the team a little, Porter. They're near
tuckered." "Who's doing this driving?" cried Markham. "I never yet had to ask a saphead for
advice in handling horses." And again the whip fell on the straining flanks. 

Peters clenched his fists in the bearskin gloves. It occurred to him that he could lift Markham
bodily out of the front seat, take his place, and do the driving himself; but he did not. The
horses struggled on, and in the falling dark the travelers topped a rise that gave them a dim
view of the buildings of Morton's ranch. A light showed in one of the ranch-house windows like
a star and toward it Markham drove, and presently halted at the door.

"Now that I've handled the reins all the way from Devil's Lake, Nix," remarked Markham as he
jumped out and helped Hesther to alight, "I allow it's up to you to take care of the team..
Cold, Essie?"

"Not a bit," the girl answered, and hurried toward the door. Markham followed her, and Peter
drove on to the stable. As he unhitched and brought the horses into the shelter, he was a
little surprised to discover that there were no other animals in the place. The team was
Morton's, but Bailey's cow horse, together with those of Peters and Markham, should have been
in the stable; unless Bailey was out oat the corral and shelter sheds, looking after the fifty
range horses that were kept up there.

Peters lighted a lantern, removed the harness from the horses, and, after putting hay in the
mangers, began rubbing the animals down with an old gummy sack. He was hard at this when a call
reached his ears from the house: "Peters! This way---on the jump!"

It was Markham's voice, and there was a note of alarm in it that startled Peters. Lantern in
hand, he hurried out of the stable and made his way to the house. Flinging the door wide, he
crossed the threshold into the ranchhouse sitting room.

"What's wrong, Porter?" he asked. The "cannon-ball" stove glowed with heat. That, and the
bright oil lamp, dazzled Peters's eyes for the moment, and he could not see what was going on
in the room. "Bailey has been hurt," came the voice of Markham. "Every horse in the herd whas
been driven off by thieves--and they even took Bailey's mount with the rest. Biggest outrage
that ever happened in these parts! I'd like to know what the blamed country is coming to!"

The blur lifted from before Peters' eyes. He saw Bailey, his face twisted with pain, lying on a
couch. Mrs. Morton bent over him, bathing a wounded shoulder from a basin of hot water. Her
husband was walking up and down, fuming and sputtering. Markham stood beside the couch, looking
down at the foreman with a queer expression on his face. Hesther, all excited, was removing her
wraps with shaking hands. "Horses stolen!" gasped Peters, dazed by the weird calamity. "How
could it happen? Is Bailey badly hurt?"

"Don't stand there gawping!" fussed Morton. "Something has got to be done, and it's up to you
and Markham to do it.  A gang of scoundrels from across the line made off with the stock; and
it's been no more than three hours since it happened. Take my team and go to Roscommon. The
sheriff's got to be notified. Bailey says the thieves are making for the north, and if you and
Markham are quick a posse can get between the gang and the boundary line. For heaven's sake,
Peters, wake up!"

Peters shook himself, put down the lantern, and came to the side of the couch. "Whey don't
Markham wake up?" he asked. "Hasn't he suggested anything yet?" "Nothing to suggest," Markham
answered, flashing a sharp look at Peters. "It's twenty miles to Roscommon, and no chance of
getting there ahead of the thieves and the stolen stock. The only animals we can put our hands
on are the two that brought us from Devil's lake, and they are done up. You know that, Peters."

"What about using skates or skis?" inquired Peters. "By thunder, there is a way of getting to
Roscommon in time to help the sheriff head off the stolen stock!"

There was a dominant, compelling note in the voice of Peters. It was so unexpected in its
assertiveness that every one in the room was startled. His washed-out blue eyes fenced
aggressively with the snapping black eyes of Markham. "Skates or skis!" repeated Markham, his
upper lip curling. "Why, it's all of thirty miles to Roscommon, if you follow the crook of the
river! And how much would you figure it by skis, if you crossed Bear Butte instead of going
around it? Talk sense, if you know how, Nix! Don't forget the fellows who rustled our stock
have three hours the lead."

"How far will three hours of driving in this snow get the stolen herd?" returned Peters. "The
Thieves will have a tough job of it. They--"

Bailey twisted his flushed face from under the ministering hands of Mrs. Morton. "The varmints
are going north by the Long Knife Dry Wash," he said, his voice shaking with the pain of his
wound. "That's only three miles west of Roscommon. If you boys could get word to the sheriff
somehow, I reckon he might head off the raiders with a posse. But if you do anything, you'll
have to do it quick. Porter," and his eyes swerved to Markham, "I'm looking to you---Uncle Si
Goddard is looking to you. Nigh on to five thousand dollars' worth of horses are being pushed
towards the border, and here I'm helpless to do a thing."

"It don't seem possible to do a thing, Reece," returned Markham. "If we could round up a crown
of men in short order, and take after the thieves on fresh horses, like enough we might
overhaul them. But where's the riding stock? Why, Morton's nearest neighbor is ten miles away!"

Peters flashed a disapproving glance at Markham, pulled off his bearskin gloves, and slumped
down in a chair by the stove. From the pockets of his overcoat he took his skates, also a new
strap he had secured in Devil's Lake City. Quickly he replaced the broken strap with the new
one.

"You going to try and get to Roscommon by river, Nix?" Morton inquired. "I figure the chances
are better that way than going over Bear Butte on skis," Peters answered. "The river's clean of
snow, and mostly the ice is like a looking-glass. I am going to do my best to get word to the
sheriff and to start a Roscommon doctor this way to look after Bailey."

"You are locoed!" growled Markham. It's all right to get a doctor for Reese here, but there
ain't a chance to save the stock this side of the line. Let the raiders get it across the
boundary and then take the matter up with the Canadian Mounted Police. That's my advice.

"If you wait till the stock is out of this country," put in the rancher, "there won't be a
chance." "Not a chance on earth," agreed Bailey. "That outfit of thieves knowed exactly what
they was about. Everything was cut and dried, and somebody sure tipped them off regarding the
layout here. I'll bet a thousand against a chink wash ticket that them bronks will be took care
of across the line so'st they can't be located by nobody. Them thieves picked a time when I was
alone at the shelter sheds and Porter and Nix was to the winter sports at the lake. They
dropped me out of my saddle without whys or wherefores, and then made off with my mount and
sent a man to the stable for Peters' and Markham's riding horses. By the time I covered the
mile back to the ranch house the stock was ell on the way North.

He broke off abruptly, clenching his teeth hard as a spasm of pain ran through his body. I'll
get another coat, remarked Peters, rising from his chair and starting for the door that led to
his room. It won't be possible to make any kind of time in a long overcoat like this. He
disappeared.

Markham came to the side of the couch. If peters has a chance, Reece, said he, he'll make a
bobble of some kind and spoil it all. That's his way. I better go to Roscommon myself. Peters
can use his skates and take the river trail, and I'll use my skis and go over the butte. I
don't think we have a ghost of snow ahead of the stock, but it's up to us to see what we can
do.

That's the talk, exclaimed Morton approvingly. The thieves had help from this ranch, he added
darkly, tossing a significant glance toward the door through which Peters just passed, and I
haven't got a whole lot of confidence in at least one man around here. Peters is square, Bailey
averred. Square as a die. He just don't seem to have the knack for putting his ideas across.
The man that saves them bronks, Porter, he added significantly, is going to make the biggest
kind of a hit with Goddard.
