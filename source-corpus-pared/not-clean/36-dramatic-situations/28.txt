THIRD SITUATION
CRIME PURSUED BY VENGEANCE
(Elements: an Avenger and a Criminal)

Vengeance is a joy divine, says the Arab; and such
indeed it seems to have frequently been, to the God
of Israel. The two Homeric poems both end with an
intoxicating vengeance, as does the characteristic
Oriental legend of the Pandavas; While _to the Latin and
Spanish races the most satisfying of spectacles is still
that of an individual capable of executing a legitimate,
although illegal, justice. So much goes to prove that
even twenty centuries of Christianity, following ﬁve
centuries of Socratic philosophy, have not suﬂ‘iced to re-
move Vengeance from its pedestal of honor, and to sub-
stitute thereon Pardon. And Pardon itself, even
though sincere,—what is it but the subtile quintessence
of vengeance upon earth, and at the-same time the
claiming of a—sort of wergild from Heaven?

A (1)—The Avenging of a Slain Parent or Ancesp
torz—“The Singer," an anonymous Chinese drama;
“The Tunic Confronted” (of the courtesan Tchang-
koue-pin) ; “The Argives” and “The Epigones” of
Aeschylus; Sophocles’ “Aletes and Erigonef’ “The
Two Foscari,” by Byron; Werner’s “Attila;” “Le Crime
de Maison—Alfort” (Coedes, 1881); “Le Maquignon"
(Josz and Dumur, 1903). In the last three cases, as
well as in the following one, the vengeance is accom-
piished not by a son, but by a daughter. Example
