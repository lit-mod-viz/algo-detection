which on so many historic occasions she has mani-

tragic expression; that cry of humanity with which
a single priest, at the massacre of Fourmies, rallied to
the Church a fraction of revolutionary France; the
worship of the dead, that ﬁrst, last, most primitive
and most indestructible form of religious sentiment;
the agony which awaits us all, agony dragging itself
toward the darkness like a spent beast; the profoundly
humble longlng of one whom a murder has deprived
of all that was dearest to him, that pitiable entreaty,
on bended knees, which melted into tears the savage
ranoor of Achilles and caused him to forget his vow;—
all are here in this First Situation, all these strong
emotions, and yet others; nowhere else, indeed, can
they be found in such completeness,—and our modern
world of art has forgotten this situation!
