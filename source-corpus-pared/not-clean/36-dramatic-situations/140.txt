CONCLUSION 185

appeal to some antique authority. From 1830 dates
the accession to the literary throne of this Charlatan-
esque "faculty,” analysis of which is, it would seem,
eternally interdicted. The results of this new regime
were not slow in appearing, and they may be seen, in
their ﬁnal decay, among the last successors of ultra—

patiently applied to the smallest details,—the antithesis
of Being and of Seeming.

this legend of the Imagiliation by Positivism, Which

in all manner of methodless combinations. These
souvenirs of innumerable readings of the products of
imitation in our neo—classic and Romantic past, envel-

Naturalists’ initiative as an element of renovation.
Even the Naturalists themselves have too often viewezi
