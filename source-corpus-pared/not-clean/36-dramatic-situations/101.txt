96 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

Enamored:—“Le Sculpteur de Masques" (Cromelynck,
1911).

(2)—A Brother and Sister in Love With Each

“’Tis Pity She’s a Whore,” Ford’s masterpiece; “La

examples: the “Laius” of Aeschylus; the "Chrysippus"
of Euripides. The latter tragedy appears to have been
one of the ﬁnest, and perhaps the most moving, of all
antiquity. Three situations were there superposed
with rare success. Laius having conceived a passion,
