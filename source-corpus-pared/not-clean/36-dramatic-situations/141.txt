186 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

estimated too highly the power of the artistic temper-
ament, however vigorous it may be, in assuming that
it could interpose itself, alone and stripped of all con-
vention, by a simple effort of will, between Nature
and the literary product to be engendered. Thug “La

special form which is as common in books as it is rare
in life; thus the starting-point of ”L(Euvre" is merely
the converse of the “thesis" of the Goncourts and
Daudet; thus reminiscences of “Madame Bovary” ap-

And all the old marionettes have reappeared, inﬂated
with philosophic and poetic ampliﬁcations, but too
often empty of symbolism, as of naturalism and
humanism.

As to the methods of the Art of Combining, the
truth may be grasped by one bold look, one triumphant
glance at all these phantoms of trite thought, as they

gories. Any writer may have here a starting—point
for observation and creation, outside the world of paper
and print, a starting-point personal to himself, original

create new ones, have complicated the old, entangling
themselves in their own threads.

Especially will the invention of an unusual story,
the discovery of a “virgin ﬁeld,” (to use the naturalists’
term) be made so easy as to be almost valueless. We
are not unaware of the importance, in the perfecting of
Greek art, of the fact that it was circumscribed and
