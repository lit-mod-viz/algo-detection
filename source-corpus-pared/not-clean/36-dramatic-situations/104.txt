TWENTY-SEVENTH SITUATION
V DISCOVERY OF THE DISHONOR OF A LOVED ONE
(The Discoyerer; the Guilty One)

From this Situation there results, almost immediately,
a psycholch struggle similar to that of the Twenty—
Third, “Sacriﬁce of Loved Ones,” but without the
attraction of a high Ideal; this is replaced, in the pment
action, by the lash of shame.

A (l)—Discovety of a Mother’s Shame:—
“Madame Caverlet” by Augier; “Odette” afnd
“Georgette” by Sardou; “Madame X" (Bisson, 1908);
“Mrs. Warren’s Profesion” (Bernard. Shaw); “Les
Quarts d’Heure” (second part; Guiches and Lavedan,
1888). This sad destruction of a child’s deepest re-
spect and reverence is colored, in those works, by the
terrors of the mother, by her blushes, by her remorse
before the consequences of the past; through this last
point the action ends in the Thirty-Fourth (Remorse).
It remains unconnected in the second part of the-
“Marquis de Priola” (Lavedan, 1901).

(2)—Discovery of a Father’s Shame:—“Vieille His-
toire” (Jean Jullien, 1891); the dénouement of ”Pierre
et Thér " (Prevost, 1909).

(3)—Discovery of a Daughter‘s Dishonor:—Pa.rt of
“La Fille du Depute" (Morel, 1881); of “Les Aﬁaireﬁ
sont les Aﬁaires” (Mirbeau, 1902); “L’Oreille Fendue
(Nepoty, 1908).
