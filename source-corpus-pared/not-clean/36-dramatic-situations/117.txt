Birouk” (Decourcelle, 1883); “La—Béte Féroee" (Jules
Mary and Emile Rochard, 1908); “La Vie Publique”
(Fabre, 1901). In comedy: “Ubu-roi" (Jarry). In ﬁc-
tion: “La Fortune des Rougon” (with criminality atten-
uated to simple want of dignity); “Son Excellence Eugene”
(sacriﬁce of morality); the story of Lucien de Rubem-
pré; a case of greed: “La Terre.”

(2)—Parricidal Ambitionz—“Tullia” by Martelli.

Ambition, one of the most powerful of passions, if it
be not indeed the .passion par excellence will always
aﬁect the spectator strongly, for he feels and knows
that, once awakened in a man, it will cease only
with his death. And how many are the (Sbjects of its
desire! Tyrannical power, high rank, honors, fortune
(by inheritance, man-iage, robbery, etc. ), the conserva-
tion of riches (avarice), glory (political, scientiﬁc, lit-
erary, inventive, artistic), celebrity, distinction.

We have seen in Class A the ties which may unite
the ambitious one and his adversary and the Situations
which may result from them (XIX, XXIII, XXIV).

Here Is one way among many to intensify the fury of
'C: mingle with it the sincerity of a faith, of a convic-
tion; such a combination is found in the case of the
Spaniards in Peru and in Flanders, and in the case of
our own “gentle and intellectual” race under the
League and under the Terror; in the case of Calvin,
and of the Inquisition.
