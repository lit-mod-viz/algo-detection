66 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

fatal error is revealed, simultaneously to the spectator
and to the character, only after it is irreparable, as in
Class A; and here the state of mind strongly recalls the
Sixteenth. In the second, the spectator, informed of
the truth, sees the character walk unconsciously to-
ward the crime, as though in a sinister sort of blind-
man’s—buff, as in Classes B, C and D.

A (1)—Discovery That One Has Married Ones
Mother:—the “(Edipus” of Aeschylus, of Sophocles,
of Seneca, of Anguillara, of Comeille, of Voltaire, not
to speak of those of Achaeus, Philocles, Melitus,
Xenocles, Nicomachus, Carcinus, Diogenes, Theodecte,
Julius Caesar; nor of those of Jean Prévost, Nicolas de
Sainte-Marthe, Lamothe, Ducis, J. Chenier, etc. The
greatest praise of Sophocles consists in the astonish-
ment we feel that neither the many imitations, nor
the too well-known legend of the abandonment on
Cithaeron, nor the old familiar myth of the Sphinx,
nor the difference in the ages of the wedded pair.——that
none of these things has made his work appear un-
natural or unconvincing.

(2)—Discovery That One Has Had :1 Sister as Mis-
tress:——Tasso’s “Torrismond”; “The Bride of Messina"
by Schiller. This case, obviously a more frequent one.
becomes unconvincing in the latter drama, when com-
bined With the Nineteenth Situation. Example from
ﬁction: “L’Enfant Naturel," by Sue.

B (1)—Discovery That One Has Married Ones
Sisterz—“Le Mariage (1’ Andre” (Lemaire and de
Rouvre, 1882). This being a comedy, the error is dis-
covered in time to be remedied, and the play “ends
happily.” “Abufar” by Ducis, which also falls under
a preceding classiﬁcation.

(2)—The Same Case, in Which the Crime Has Been
Villainously Planned by a Third Person:—“Herac1ius"
(this gives, despite its genius, rather the feeling of a
nightmare than of a terrible reality).
