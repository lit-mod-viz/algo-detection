140 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

sense of that word. The architecture of those cen-
turies grew, stone by stone, plan by plan, out of the
most practical of reasons‘ In their sculpture there
was nothing “naive"—the naivete is ours, when we so
estimate that sculpture, which is far more realistic
than our own;' and if, persisting in the contrary
opinion, we cling to the weird forms of the gargoyles,
it may be said that, born of a symbolism akin to those
of Egypt and Greece, they represent analogies equally
ingenious and profound. In this period arose Thom-
ism, lately called back into a position of honor to
combat Positivism, and which realized so happy a
harmony between Aristotelianism and Christian faith,
between science and theology. In this period, too,»
were born the natural sciences, and, in the minds of its
poets, evolved the laws by which our poetry lives today,
those rhythms which through Ronsard we still hear,
that Rhyme which we gave to all Europe,—and, at the
same time, thy grained vaultings, 0 little town of
Saint-Denis, suzerain oriﬂamme, pilot-barque of France!
All these were born, and grew, beneath the grave gaze
of the same wisdom which, on the Ionian shores, was
called Athene.

Toward a new aspect of the same logic our own age
already turns, since, having drunk of that antiquity by
whose forces we ruled Europe a second time in the
XVII Century; having drunk of the latest of great
foreign inﬂuences, the Germanic, we are returning to
reality and to the future. Thus, when each Greek
city had absorbed the neighboring local cults (its
“foreign inﬂuences") and the Oriental cults (the
“antiquity” of that day), the most beautiful of
mythologies were formed. It is, at least, toward an
art purely logical, purely technical, and of inﬁnitely
varied creations, that all our, literary tendencies seem
to me to be converging. In that direction proceed
Flaubert and Zola, those rugged pioneers, Ibsen.
