124 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

Need I call attention to the small number, but the
terrible beauty, of the above works? Is it necessary
to indicate the inﬁnite varieties of Remorse, according
to; lst, the fault committed (for this, enumerate all
crimes and misdemeanors included in the legal code.
plus those which do not fall under any law; the fault,
moreover, may at the writer’s pleasure be real or
imaginary, committed without intention, or intended
but not committediwhich permits a “happy ending”
—or both intended and committed; premeditated or
not, with or without complicity, outside inﬂuences, sub—
tlety, or what not); 2nd, the nature, more or less im-
pmionable and nervous, of the culprit; 3rd, the surf
roundings, the circumstances, the morals which pre—
pare the way for the appearance of Remorse—that ﬁg-
ure plastic, ﬁrm and religious among the Greeks, the
beneﬁcially enervating phantasmagoria of our Middle
Ages; the pious dread of a future life in recent een-
turies; the disturbance of the equilibrium of the social
instincts and consequently of the mind according to
the inferences of Zola, etc.

With Remorse is connected the Fixed Idea; through
its perpetual action it recalls Madness or Criminal
Passion. Often it is but “remorse for a desire,” re-
mqrse the more keen in that the incessantly reviving
desire nourishes it, mingles with it, and, growing like
a sort of moral cancer, saps the soul's vitality to the
point of suicide, which is itself but the most desperate
of duels. “René,” Werther," the maniac of the
“Coeur Révélateur” and of Bérénice” (I refer to that of
Edgar For) and especially lbsen’s “Rosmersholm,”
offer signiﬁcant portraits of it.
