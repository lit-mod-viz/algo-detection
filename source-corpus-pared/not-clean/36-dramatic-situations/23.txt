18 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

penitence of Barbarossa. Familiar instances: petitions
for pardon, confession of Catholics, etc.

(4)—The Surrender of a Corpse, or of a Relic, So-
licited:—“The Phrygians” of Aeschylus, Historical
examples: the Crusaders' embassies to the Moslems‘
Familiar instances: the reclaiming of the remains of
a great man buried in a foreign land; of the body of
an executed person, or of a relative dead in a hospital.

1911).

unfamiliar, and more particularly because, Shake-

theme or elaborated it with those external complexi-
ties demanded by our modern taste, their successors
have found the First Situation too bare and simple a
subject for this epoch. As if one idea were necessarily

. more simple than another!—as if all those which have
since launched upon our stage their countless ramiﬁca-
