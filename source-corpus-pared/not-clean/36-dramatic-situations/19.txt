14 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

we shall thus have brought it into contact with the
dramatic pioﬂuction of the last thirty years.

Two hundred of the examples cited have been taken
from other literary genres akin to the dramatic:
romance, epic, history,—and from reality. For this
investigation ’can and should be pursued in human
nature, by which I mean in politics, in courts of
justice, in daily life. Amid these explorations
the present study will soon seem but an introduc-
tion to a marvellous, an inexhaustible stream,
—the Stream of Existence, where meet momen-

moralist (and amoralist) writings, humor, psychology,
law, epic, romance, fable, myth, proverb and prophecy.

It may here be allowable to ask. with our theory in
mind, a number of questions which to us are of primary
importance.

Which are the dramatic situations neglected by our
own epoch, so faithful in repeating the few most
familiar? Which, on the other hand, are most in use
today? Which are the most neglected, and which the
most used, in each epoch, genre, school, author?
What :(re the reasons for these preferences? The
same questions may be asked before the classes and
sub-classes of the situations.

Such an examination, which requires only patience,
will show ﬁrst the list of combinations (situations and
their classes and sub-classes) at present ignored, and
which remain to be exploited in contemporaneous art,
second, how these may be adapted. 0n the way it may
chance that we shall discern, hidden within this or

—one without analogue among the other thirty-ﬁve,
with no immediate relationship to any other, the
product of a vigorous inspiration. But, in carefully
determining the exact position of this case among the
sub-classes of the situation to which it belongs, we
