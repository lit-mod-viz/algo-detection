TWENTY—THIRD SITUATION
NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING LOVED ONES

(The Hero; the Beloved Victim; the Necessity for
l the Sacriﬁce)

Although similar to the‘three situations we have
just considered, the Twenty-Third recalls, in one of its
aspects, that destruction of natural affection which
marked the Thirteenth, “Hatred of Kinsmen.” The feel-
ings which we here encounter in the protagonist are,
it is true, of a nature altogether different. But through
the intrusion of the element of Necessity, the end
toward which he must proceed is precisely the same.

A (1)—NeceSSity for Sacriﬁcing a Daughter in
the Public Interestz—“The Iphigenias" of Aeschylus
and of Sophocles; “Iphigenia in Aulis," by Euripides
and by Racine; “Erechtheus” by Euripides.

(2)—Duty of Sacriﬁcing Her in Fulﬁllment of a Vow
to God:—The “Idoménées” of Crébillon, Lemierre, and
Cienfuegos; the “Jephthes” of Buchanan and of Boyer.
This nuance tends at ﬁrst toward Situation XVII, “Im-
prudence,” but the psychologic struggles soon give it
a very different turn.

(3)—Duty of Sacriﬁcing Benefactors or Loved Ones
to Ones Faith: “Torquemada;" “Ninety-Three:”
“Les Mouettes” (Paul Adam, 1906); “La Fille 2‘1 Guil-
lotin” (Fleischmann, 1910). Historic instances; Philip
II; Abraham and Isaac.

B (l)—Duty of Sacriﬁcing Ones Child, Unknown
