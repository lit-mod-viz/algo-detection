SIXTEENTH SITUATION
MADNESS
(Elements: Madman and Victim)

The origin of certain human actions lies hidden in
fearful mystery; a mystery wherein the ancients
believed they discerned the cruel smile of a god, and
wherein our scientists, like the Chinese philosophers,
believe they recognize the desires, prolonged and
hereditary, of an ancestor. A startling awakening it
is for Reason, when she ﬁnds on all sides her destiny
strewn with corpses or with dishonors, which the
Other, the unknown, has scattered at his pleasure.
At this calamity, greater than death, how our kindred
must weep and tremble; what terror and suspense must
arise in their minds! And the victims, whose cries
are lost in the mute heavens ; the beloved ones pursued
in unreasoning rage which they cannot comprehend!
What variations of the inconscient are here: folly, pos-
session, divine blindness, hypnosis, intoxication, for-
getfulness! '
