TWENTY—NINTH SITUATION 109

B (l)—The Lover is the Slayer of the Father of
His Beloved:—“Le Cid” (and the opera drawn from
it); “Olympie” by Voltaire.

(2)—The Beloved is the Slayer of the Father of her
Lover:—“Mademoiselle de Bressier” (Delpit, 1887).

(3)—The Beloved is the Slayer of the Brother of
Her Lovet:—-“La Reine Fiammette" (Mendés, 1889).

(4)—The Beloved is the Slayer of the Husband of
the Woman Who Loves Him, But Who Has Pre-
viously Sworn to Avenge that Husband:—“Iréne” by
Voltaire.

(5)—The Same Case, Except that a Lover, Instead
of a Husband, Has Been Slain:—“Fédora" (Sardou,
1882). '

(6)—The Beloved is the Slayer of a Kinsman of the
Woman Who Loves Him:—“Romeo and Juliet," this
situation being modiﬁed by that of “Abduction"
(elopement), then, with triple effect by XXXVI, “Loss
of Loved Ones;” the ﬁrst time mistakenly, the second
time simply and actually, the third time doubly and
simultaneously to both the families of the principal
characters; “l’Ancétre” (Saint-Saens and Lassus):
“Fortune and Misfortune of a Name” and “His Own
Gaoler” by Calderon.

(7)—The Beloved is the Daughter of the Slayer of
Her Lover’s Fatherz—“Le Crime de Jean Morel”

_ (Samson, 1890); “La Marchande de Sourires” (Judith
Gautier, 1888).

The chief emotional element thus remains the same
as in the Fifth (Pursuit), and Love here serves espe-
cially to present the pursued man under various favorable
lights which have a certain unity. She whom he
loves here plays, to some small extent, the rﬁle of the
Greek chorus. Suppress the love interest, replace it
