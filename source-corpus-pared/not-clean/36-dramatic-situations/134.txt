CONCLUSION

To obtain the nuances of the Thirty—Six Situations,
I have had recourse almost constantly to the same
method of procedure; for example, I would enumerate
the ties of friendship or kinship possible between the
characters; I would determine also their degree of con-
sciousness, of free-will end knowledge of the real end
toward which they were moving. And we have seen
that when it is desired to alter the normal degree of
discernment in one of the two adversaries, the intro-

becoming the blind instrument of the second, who is at
the same time invested with a Machiavellian subtlety,
to such an extent does his part in the action become
purely intellectual. Thus, clear perception being in the
one case excessively diminished, it is, in the other}
proportionately increased. Another element for modi- ,
tying all the situations is the energy of the acts which/
must result from them. Murder, for instance, may be:
reduced to a wound, a blow, an attempt, an outrage, aimi
intimidation, a threat, a too-hasty word, an intention;
not carried out, a temptation, a thought, a wish, an in-
justice, a destruction of a cherished object, a refusal

author so desires, this blow (murder or its diminu-
tives) may be aimed, not at the object of hatred in per-

be multiple and aggravated by circumstances which
the law has foreseen. A third method of varying the
situations: for this or that one of the two adversaries
whose struggle constitutes our drama, there may be
