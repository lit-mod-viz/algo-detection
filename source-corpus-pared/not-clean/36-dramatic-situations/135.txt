130 THIRTY—SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

substituted 3 group of characters animated by a single
desire, each member of the group reﬂecting that de
sire under a diﬁ'erent light. There is, moreover (as l
have already shown); no Situation which may not be
combined with any one of its neighbors, nay, with two,
three, four, ﬁve, six of them and more! Now,-these
combinations may be of nianyasorts; in the ﬁrst case,
the situations develop successively and logically one

them fall therefrom into a position not less critical,
which may even offer but a choice between two courses

from the preceding ones, and which sweeps them all
away together. . . . This, be it understood, is‘
but one combination among a thousand, for I cannot
here elaborate the system by which this study of the
Thirty—Six Situations may be continued, and by means
of which they may be endlessly multiplied; that is a
subject for a separate work upon the “Laws of Liter-
ary Invention."

The composition or arrangement of the chosen Sit-
uations—and at the same time of the episodes and
characters introduced— may be deduced in a manner
somewhat novel and interesting, from the same theory
of the “Thirty—Six.” Considering, in effect, that
“every dramatic situation springs from a conﬂict
between two principal directions of eﬁ'ort" (whence at
the same time comes our dread of the victor and our
