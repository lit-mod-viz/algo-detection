NINETEENTH SITUATION
SLAYING OF A KINSMAN UNRECOGNIZED
(The Slayer; the Unrecognized Victim)

Whereas the Eighteenth Situation attains its highest
-degree of emotion after the accomplishment of the
act, (doubtless because all the persons concerned in it
survive, and the horror of it lies chieﬂy in the conse—
quences), the Nineteenth, on the contrary, in which a
victim is to perish and in which the interest increases
by reason of the blind premeditation, becomes more
pathetic in the preparations for the crime than in the
~results. This permits a happy ending, without the
necessity of recourse, as in the Eighteenth, to a comedy—
process of error. A simple recognition of one char—
acter by another will suﬂ‘ice,—0f which our Situation
XIX is, in effect, but a development.

Daughter Unknowingly, by Command of a Divinity or
an 0racle:—-Metastasio’s “Demophon.” The ignorance
of the kinship springs from a substitution of infants;
the interpretation of the oracle’s words is erroneous;
the “jeune premiere,” at one point in the action, be
lieves herself the sister of her ﬁancé. This linking of
three or four mistakes (unknown kinship, in the
special light of the situation we are now studying, a
supposed danger of incest, as in B 2 of the preceding,
and ﬁnally a misleading ambiguity of words, as in the
majority of comedies) sufﬁces to constitute what is
called “stirring” action, characteristic of the intrigues
