TWENTY—EIGHTH SITUATION 107

' ' wherein love is important (but not of the ﬁrst impor-
tance, as in this XXVIII) returned logically and natur-
ally to an indulgence of smiles? “Le Cid," which is
the classic type of this sort, is a tragi-comedy, and all
the characters surrounding Romeo and Juliet are
frankly comic. .

Nevertheless, our blind dramatm‘gy, with continued
obstinacy, still breathes forth its solem'hities in this
equivocal rhythm. Whether the piece treats of sociol-
ogy, of politics, of religion, of questions of art, of the
title to a succession, of the exploitation of mines, of
the invention of a gun, of the discovery of a chemical
product, of it matters not what—a love story it must
have; there is no escape. Savants, revolutionists,
poets, priests or generals present themselves to us only
to fall immediately to love-making or match-making.
It becomes a mania. And we are asked to take these
tiresome repetitions seriously!

This, then, is the actual stage of today. In my opin-
ion, de Chirac alone has shown himself its courageously
logical son~although a rejected one,—society, like an
aged coquette, reserving always some secret sins, and
fearing nothing so much as nudity, which would
destroy the legend'of her imaginary wicked charms,
veiled, she willingly lets it be supposed, under her
hypocrisy.

How grotesque an aspect will our ithy'phallic obses—
sion prwent, once it is crystallized in history, when
we shall ﬁnally have returned to antique common
sense!
