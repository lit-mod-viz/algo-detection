TWENTIETH SITUATION
SELF-SACRIFICE FOR .AN IDEAL

(The Hero ; the I&eal; the “Creditor” or the Person or
Thing Sacriﬁced)

The four themes of Immolation, of which this is the
ﬁrst, bring before us three cortegesz—Gods (XX and
XXIII), Kindred (XXI and XXIII), and Desires
(XXII). The ﬁeld of conﬂict is no longer the visible
world, but the Soul.

Of these four subjects, none is nobler than this of
our Twentieth Situation,—all for an ideal! What the
ideal may be, whether political or religious, whether it
be called Honor or Piety, is of little importance. It
exacts the sacriﬁce of all ties, of interest, passion, life
itself,—far better, however, under one of the three
following forms, if it be tarnished with the slightest.
even although the most sublime, egoism.

A (1)—Sacriﬁce of Life for the Sake of Ones
Wordz—The “Regulus" of Pradon and also of Metas-
tasio; the end of “Hernani” (Carthage and Don Ruy
Gomez are the “Creditors”). Is it not surprising that
a greater: number of examples do not at once present
themselves to us? This fatality, the work of the
victim himself, and in which the victory is won over
Self,—-is it not worthy to illuminate the stage with its
sacriﬁcial ﬂames? There is, nevertheless, no necessity
for choosing a hero of an almost too—perfect type, Such
as Regulus.
