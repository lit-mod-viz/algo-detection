pit); for the vanquished), we shall have to choose, at
the rising of the curtain, between two beginnings; we '
must decide which of the two adversaries pne-exists.
This leads us infallibly to make of the second the cause
(innocent or responsible) of the drama; since it is his
appearance which will be the‘signal for the struggle.
The ﬁrst, who especially enlists our attention, is the
Protagonist, already present in the earliest Thespian
tragedy, altogether lyric, descriptive and analytic; the
second—the obstacle arising or supervening—is the
Antagonist, that principle of the action which we owe
to the objective and Homeric genius of Eschylus. One
of two strongly opposihg' colors will thus dominate the
entire work, according as we shall choose, near the be-
ginning, which of the two parties shall possess the
greater power, the greater chance of victory.

Aristotle has taught us to distinguish between
“simple” tragedy (in which the superiority remains
upon the same side until the‘ end, and in which, conse-
quently, there is no sudden change of fortune, no sur-
prise) and “complex” tragedy (the tragedy of surprise,
of vicissitude), wherein this superiority passes from
one camp to the other. Our dramatists have since re-
ﬁned upon the latter; in those of their pieces which are
least complicated, they double the change of fortune.
thus leading ingeniously to the return of the opposed
powers, at the moment of the spectators departure, to
the exact positions which they occupied when he en-
tered the hall; in their plays of complicated plot, they
triple, quadruple, quintuple the surprise, so long- as
their imaginations and the patience of the public will
permit. We thus see, in these vicissitudes of struggle,
the ﬁrst means of varying a subject. It will not go
very far, however, since we cannot, however great our
simplicity, receive from the drama, or from life, more
than one thousand three hundred and thirty-two sur-
prises.—0ne thousand three hundred and thirty-two?
