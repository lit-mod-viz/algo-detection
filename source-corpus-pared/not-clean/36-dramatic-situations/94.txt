TWENTY-FIFTH SITUATION 89

which convicts respect between themselves; that pri-
mary source of order in the world of action and Qf
thought. The spectators’ attention may of course be
momentarily turned from a point of view so strict,
and quite naturally; through the heresies of the im-
agination almost anything may evoke a laugh. Do we
not laugh heartily at the sight of a fat man tumbling
ridiculously down a ﬂight of steps, at the bottom of

directed toward the thief. But if the latter, already
far from heroic in his exploit, is in turn portrayed as
still less interesting than his dupe, he merely disgusts
us—and the adulterous wife appears but a fool to have
preferred him. Then (with that childishness which
most of us retain beneath ou'r sophistication),scenting
a foregone conclusion in the lesson which the author
intends for us, and suspecting falsehood at the bottom
of it, we grimace with irritation, disappointed to per-
ceive, behind the story presented for our entertain-
ment, the vinegarish smile of the school-teacher.

Third Casez—The deceived Husband or Wife is
Avenged. Here, at last, something happens! But this
