CONCLUSION 141

Strindberg, and all writers deliberately unmindful of
their libraries, as the Hellenes were of barbarian litera-
ture; there moves Maeterlinck, having reduced action
to' the development of a single idea; Verlaine, deliver-
ing from conventional rules true rhythm, which makes
for itself its own rules; Mallarmé, prince of ellipse,
clarifying syntax and expelling clouds of our little
parasite words and tattered formulae; in that direction
Moréas calls us, but without freeing himself, unfortun-
ately, from the Italianism of our socalled Renaissance;
all these, and others not less glorious, a whole new
generation springing up, futurists, “loups,” cubists.
seem to me to be seeking the same goal, the ﬁnal
abolition of all absolute authority, even that of Nature
and of our sciences her interpreters; and the erection
upon its débris of simple logic, of an art solely
technical, and thus capable of revealing an unknown
system of harmony; in brief, an artists’ art.

In literature, in dramatic literature which is the
special subject of our consideration, the investigation
of Proportion of which I have above spoken will show
us the various “general methods” of presenting any
situation whatever. Each one of these “general
methods," containing a sort of canon applicable to all
situations, will constitute for us an “order” analogous
to the orders of architecture, and which, like them,
will take its place with other orders, in a dramatic
"system.” But the systems, in their turn, will come
together under certain rubrics yet more general, com-
parisons of which will furnish us many a subject for
reﬂection. In that which we might call Enchantment,
there meet, oddly enough, systems as far apart
in origin as Indian drama; certain comedies
of Shakespeare (“A Midsummer Night’s Dream”;
“The Tempest”), the “ﬁabesque” genre of Gozzi,
and “Faust;” the Mystery brings together the
works of Persia, Thespis and the pre—Aeschyleans,
