22 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

the Child plays the role of deliverer and dispenser of
justice, forms a bitter enough contrast to the fate
which awaited the poet himself in his old age.)

(2)—Rescue by Friends, or by Strangers Grateful
for Beneﬁts or Hpspitalityz—Sophocles’ “(Eneus,”
“Iolas” and “Phineus.” A partial example: the
second part of Euripides’ “Alceste.” Example in
comedy: Musset’s “Fantasio.” Example in which
protection is accorded by the host who has granted
asylum: Euripides' “Dictys.”

We see, by a glance over these subdivisions, what our
writers might have drawn from the second of the Situ-
ations. For us, indeed, it should possess some little
attraction, if only for the reason that two thousand
years ago humanity once more listened to this story
of the Deliverer, ax? since then has so suffered, loved
and wept for the sa e of it. This situation is also the
basis of Chivalry, that original and individual heroism
of the Middle Ages; and, in a national sense, of the
French Revolution. Despite all this, in art,—if we
except the burlesque of Cervantes, and the transplend-
ent light ﬂashing from the silver armor of
Lohengrin,—in art, as yet, it is hardly dreamed of.
