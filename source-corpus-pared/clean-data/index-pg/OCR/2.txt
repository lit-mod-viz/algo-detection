The Plot Genie Index was originally published in 1931 by The
Gagnon Company in Hollywood, California.

The text of this book is taken from the fifth edition, reflecting
changes in the text that Wycliffe A. Hill made shortly after the
original publication.

Hill referred to his cardboard spinner wheel as a “Plot Robot.”
An aspiring author was instructed to turn the device a certain
number of times, to select a random number (usually between 1
to 180). Plot Genie users then consulted the lists to arrive at all
the elements Hill believed necessary for a fully realized plot.

Bold Venture Press will have additional materials on its website
for Plot Genie enthusiasts. A downloadable ”Plot Robot,” which
can be assembled by eager authors, will be available. We are
examining the possibility 0f offering professionally manufactured
“Plat Robot“ wheels for authors whe prefer a more polished
touch.

Several “Random Number Generators.” are online These
websites make an excellent substitute for the Plot Robot"

Pages 142 & 143 present original advertisements for the
Plot Genie supplements Bold Venture Press will offer these
supplements in facsimile editions in 2015.
