ular lave story plot. Six supplementary formulas complete with
separate indexes have been prepared for the use of those authors
whose market demandg a special type of story. They are:

acterization, together with exercises Which not only develop
one's ability t0 portray character, but. suggest innumerable
interesting and novel characters far the genuine romantic

(2)-—-—ACTIONwADVENTURE S'I‘ORIES, without love interest.
Certain magazines demand this type of story, so we have
recognized the necessity of pmviding a distinct formula with
a special index which supplies the adventure story Without
love interest Some authors and editors refer to these as ”Ac—
tion” stories.

(4)-— ----- C OMEDY. Here was the most difﬁcult 0f all formulas to
produce. Comedy, like electricity, we all know, but it is ex»
ceedingly hard to deﬁne. In analyzing comedy down to its
basic elements and than providing an absolute formula Which
Will invariably provide the comedy plot, we have accom:-
plished that Which has never been done before in the history
of literature and drama.
