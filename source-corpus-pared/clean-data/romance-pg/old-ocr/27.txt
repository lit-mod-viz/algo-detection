PLOT GENIE ROMAN CE

A nonchalant, blase and sophisticated girl.

“Florence’s lips parted in a mocking smile. “Yes, I know you
are engaged. But what I'm asking is, are you engaged to be marl
ried—or engaged to wait?"

Worldly wise and inclined to be cynical.

“Lamont threw away his cigarette and and shifted in his chair
so he could look out the window. His voice cmied a new and

Meditative.

"His three lieutenants were a trio well ﬁtted to serve such a
master. All four of the hoodlums turned their eyes on Morrow as
he entered the room. The air seemed tense. The expressions 0n
the {our faces were gritnwauspicious, dangerous. “Set down,”

Wicked, bold, determined and overbearing.

“In the bathroom Paula gazed intently at her eyebrows. No,
they did not need the tweezers. Her face emerged from cold cream
and skin tonic looking oddly naked without: its makeup. She
colored and powdered it again quickly, and With anxious care drew
the bright curves of her mouth. She brushed her lacquershining
hair, and clipped an inﬁnitesimal raggedness from the edge of her
bang. Others might let their hair grow long and wear it in a bun;
that did not suit her type. She drew a perfumemoist ﬁnger along
her eyebrow and behind her ears, polished her naﬂs again on the
balls of her thumbs."

Self'centered, vain, poised, discriminative and personiﬁed.

“After a few puﬁs, he had thrown his cigarette away. “Look,”
he said, ”I‘m going to marry you." Paula laughed. “I love your
line," she answered."

Saucy, slangy and dubious.

L “Mechanically, her hands measured yards of the bright ribbons.
Automatically, her voice asked, “How many yards?“ or “Red or
green satin?” or "Why not try silver gauge for something unusual?"
