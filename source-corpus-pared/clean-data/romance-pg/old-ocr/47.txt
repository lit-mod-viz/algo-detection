PLOT GENIE ROMAN CE

chases the latter OH the scene, the plot complies with the Genie suggestion
that a threatened separation of the lovers is caused by a conﬂict between a
kinsman of the lover and the lover.

A real good hokum ending- would be to have the boy do the Lochinvar
stunt 0f abducting the Huckstress, throwing her into a ramshackle ﬂivver
which he had rigged out with his numerous inventions. We might assume
that he even built wings on the thing, and that it “takes OH.“ The climax
suggested by the Genie is that love is won or lost by lover of beloved
sacriﬁcing country, which would suggest that the lover who might be a
Serb, decides to ﬂy to Sweden and adopt the native country of the Huck!
stress as his own, in which event we would of course have to establish
early in the story that there was an additional conﬂict between the lovers
on accountof their nationality. A

Now we have constructed the ﬁrst rough skeleton plot idea from the
Genie outline here. It is to be understood as a matter of course that the
development of the story from this idea will call for the writing of a. synop’
sis containmg‘ humorous, interesting bits of action and by’play which will
suggest themselves as we go along. Also, for motion picture purposes or
any kind of a play, there would have to be introduced numerous gags, the
opportunities for which will be easily perceived by the comedy writer as
he develops the continuity. There may be even more conceived in the
minds of the director, actors, or some other member of the company while
the picture or play is being produced. Motion picture comedy producers
have special “gag” men or women who are present while the picture is
being ﬁlmed, with their minds concentrated to discover every possible
opportunity for the introduction of a bit of “horse play" which will get a
laugh.
