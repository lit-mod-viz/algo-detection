PLOT GENIE ROMANCE

of the “smooth paper” variety. I would say that if the situation, plot or
story is melodramatic, it is melodramatic, that is all there is to it. It makes
(no difference where it is published or whether it is published at all. The
following. paragraph appears in the article:

“Melodrama in itself is simply drama decorated with ﬂowery
superlatives to arouse the emotions of those who are not overgifted

skull joins the spine!"

“If such had appeared in a pulp magazine it would have been
dubbed melodrama of the worst kind .It was. drama only because
it appeared in a book of a famous writer, brought out by a famous
firm of publishers."

The most sensational kind of melodrama, I wouid say, and the situation
above described is an illustration of my deﬁnition that melodrama is where
a vicious or malicious method is used to gain an end. Again Mr. Barker
says:

“Take it on the whole, though melodrama may be deﬁned as
ﬁction written 1'11 an overrlurid style; ﬁction in which Superlatives
