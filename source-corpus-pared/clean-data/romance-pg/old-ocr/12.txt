PLOT GENIE ROMANCE

claim new justiﬁcation with presentation of a drama in which sensar
tional scenes worked powerfully upon the spectators" emotions.

Today, melodrama it; that production—liberary or dramatic;
offered from magazine or book page or stage~——in which the effort
is made by presentation of sensational incidents to work powerfully
upon the emotions; in Which-sensation is often achieved by exaggerate

the principal characters. In its best form it has a repression, a dig»

It seems to me that the principal difference between a Melo—
dramatic Love Story and a Love Romance is one of Suspense If
John loves Mary and Mary loves John and they cannot marry
because he supports his mother and her Widowed father doesn‘t
wish to lose an unpaid housekeeper; and they live apart and yearn:
ing until John’s mother and Mary‘s father die or get married, they
have lived a Love Romance Of course there is suspense in such an
aEaix. But what a mild variety and degree of Suspense. It can be
a pretty tale, glinting with moonlight, full of the fmgrance of blosr
