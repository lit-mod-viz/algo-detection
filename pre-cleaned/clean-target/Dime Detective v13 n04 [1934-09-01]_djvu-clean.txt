CHAPTER ONE Just Call Me Rat LIFTED the phone
The voice was low husky and evidently disguised
said Yes Detective Brown is here
Who wants to speak to him Not soul wants to speak to him came over the wire
Youre Dean Con don
Well give him this message
Its from friend can get him right here and Who is it Say if you want to do the talking all Vee Brown Novel by Carroll John Daly Author of The Murder Syndicate etc
The man turned Its quick job for you too lady Friday the ththat was the night on the Murder Syndicates crime calendar which had been picked for the final blood coupa coup that was due to net millions for the death master
And that was the night Detec tive Brown went beserkfor Gertrude la Palatin was scheduled to go up on the wall living picture of the Syndicates red revenge on the Crime Machine
right if you want to listen to some im portant news about the Murder Syndi cate why Yes yes fairly shot the words in
Im listening Well button up the mouth then the voice went on and somehow got the impression it was an educated man trying to talk as if he were not
Ive got tip spill it to Vee Brown
Gertrude la Dime Detective Magazine Palatin is going to be shot to death just before the evening performance
Did you hear that Yes heard that
By whom Boy The laugh was harsh cackle
Youve got all the questions and Ive got the answers
By the Murder Syndi cate
Just guy sent by the Murder Syn dicate
You want his name
Dont breathe so hard or you cant hear it
His name is Wallace
Big Boy Wal lace
Youve heard it before And had heard it
It was the man Vee and the police were scouring the city to find
Known to have committed at least three murders suspected of committing dozen
Arrested as many times brought to trial once
But there was no evidence against him then no witness at least who could be produced
The man who was famous for beating the rap for mur der
Therefore he was valuable to the head of this Murder Syndicate
But Big Boy Wallace had bad habit habit that didnt break out more than once year
He liked to hit up the liquor and he liked to swagger and he hated his enemies
So like all criminals Wallace made the big mistake
While half seas over he came face to face with man he had hated for years
And Wallace forgot his surroundings forgot he was on crowded thoroughfareor didnt care
Anyway he shot the man to deathbe fore many witnesses seven of whom had already identified his picture
TIG BOY WALLACE was wanted man wanted more than any man in the city
The papers were riding the de partment for three innocent bystanders had been shot and one had died
The police wanted Wallace just for murder
But Vee Brown wanted him for more than that He wanted him because Wal lace knew the head of the Murder Syndi cate
Brown didnt know that
But he knew that the head of the Murder Syndicate had made mistake
He gen erally chose his murderers carefully through others so that he would not be known
Now he had not chosen care fully and Wallace in some way had dis covered his identity
Yes Wallace could name the head of this Murder Syndicate and Brown was sure that he would
Vee had received his information straight from Gertrude la Palatin who in turn had received it from the jeweler Ulrich Rossimire just before Rossimire was killed
But the man on the phone was still talking
Listen he went on
Get ev ery word of this for Brown
Its some mouthful
dont want that dame getting knocked off Ive spent too much money going to see her shows
Brown is ex pected at her dressing room at eight oclock
The Murder Syndicate is going to drag him off with fake message
Tell him not to fall for it Big Boy Wallace will just appear at her dressingroom door shes expecting Brown and will let him in
Then he shoots her to death
Theres fire escape right outside that dressing room
Tell Brown to anchor on it watch through the windowand there is Wallace right in the bag
Mark this fellow
Im giving you the tip
Play it any other way and blooey like that Vee Brown loses Wallace and loses the girl friend and maybe loses his life
Re membertell Brown to play it my way And you wont tell me who you are so we can reward you The man hesitated long time then laughed
Im not that dumb
But Ill tell you why Im blowing the show
Ive been sucked in by the Murder Syndicate this leader has the goods on me
dont want to do jolt and while aint soft cant go for nailing guys up on walls
Wallace has me jammed up
Hell go for Red Friday anything
Im not guy who minds hard names as much as mind hard labor up the river
Im willing to rat out on this guy
So just call me Rat The receiver clicked across the wire
dropped the phone back in its cradle dashed to the music room burst in on Vee Brown
Its the Murder Syndicate again cried
Theyre going to kill Gertrude la PalatinPal And gave him the whole conversation as remembered it Brown came to his ieet Its the break he exulted
The break Ive been waiting for
Weve got him Deangot him at last
It always comes that way
stool pigeon lad that couldnt stand the gruesome murders
lad He stop ped looked at me rubbed his chin
Let me have it again word for word Tive times guess went over that conversation
While was talking the telegram came
Mortimer Doran wanted to see Brown at eight oclock at his house
Stupid Vee said then shook his head
Or is it
Try to get Doran on the phone
No nohe stopped me wefll go through with it
Dean but dont like it Dont like it
Why shant know He shook his head
Dont you think Ive been expecting an attempt on Pals life
Dont you think Ive had the theater guarded for these few performances shes giving
Why man couldnt get to her
As for Wal lace
Hes dumb and hard but hes killer
The worst kind of killer
Yet hell cover himself smell the coppers mile awayand wont come But if he doesnt come you wont But he will come Vee was on his feet
He will by God
Ill see to that if the tips on the level TjVVE minutes later we were speeding downtown in taxi
It was Saturday afternoon and there was matinee
We didnt drive directly to the theater
Brown climbed from the cab and we walked around the block
That will be the fire escape He pointed up at the rusted iron outside the old playhouse
Run your eye to it then straight from it up to the roof across the street
That would be just about in line
man could lie on that roof with highpowered rifle and being any land of shot pop us off nicely Its trapfor youfor us said
dont know
silly trap
Id spot it at once
Its stupid Dean
Thats why think its on the level He nodded thoughtfully
However Ill have cou ple of good plainclothesmen up on the roof
Well see Pal and talk it over And we did see Pal
Radiantly beauti ful she bounced into the dressing room from fresh triumph green eyes blazing lights as she threw her arms about Vee
Its the last performance tonight She dragged the wig from her head and tossed it across the room
only took the engagement because of Meyer he believed in me and started me you know
Then back to hunting down the killerthe head of this Murder Syndicate
Ive got hunch Vee
Im going to play it strong hunch
want you out of this
This foolish idea that you owe something to society forfor your past
Youve done enough and She put both her hands against his cheeks
Wont you hear the hunch since its about Inspector Ramseyand his being right for once All right if its possible that Ramsey can be right Its his playboy she said
The mil lionaire Teddy Melrose who lost all his money
He knew Broadway knew both Dime Detective Magazine the upper and under part of the city
Racketeers bankers racetrack touts dowagers
Hes been booked to pay by the Murder Syndicateand he cant
Ive got hunch that the head of this Murder Syndicate would like to use man like thatand with smileand perhaps girl like me Baloney said Brown
Ramsey used Teddy Melrose once and he ran like scared rabbit Then he told her about the phone call the plot to kill her
But why me
They never asked me for any money they know better She extended open empty hands
But it shows that the head of this Murder Syndicate is human after all
spoiled his plans killed his few trusted men nearly wrecked his racket which he hasnt been able to rebuild yet
Now for revenge where could he strike me harder than through you Her mouth puckered
bet you tell that to all the girls she said
TROWN tried to grin it was not success
He put his hands on her shoulders
want you to quit the show not play tonight
Dean and will lie on the fire escape No no She didnt stamp her feet just set both of them hard down upon the floor and faced Vee
It wouldnt work
thinkyes think you must be in love with me She laughed
Wallace would know those things cant be kept quiet
And if it would work wouldnt do it
Quit the show
Quit Meyer on the last nightthe big night Its for big purpose Palthe dis covery of the leader of this murder rack et
For can make Wallace talk
Its to save livesmany lives Her laugh broke in on him
Youre talking like child
Of course Id do it to save livesmany lives
But if Im here when he comes there is more chance of saving those lives
Ill stay right here Ill open the dressingroom door Ill spring the trap for you Vee didnt want to do it
She rushed on Youll be there on the fire escape with gun
You can watch Wallaces every movement
Why you have only to step through the window and there you are Brown rubbed hand across his mouth
guess youre right he said
They call me the CrimeMachine and and He stiffened drew back from her
Youll be absolutely in no danger
Ill have him covered from the moment he enters the room Tonight then at eight
Youll come from inside or outside From outside Vee said
Ill tip you off from the window before eight She grinned
With my experience in the underworld we can pull it off She curled her lip into sneer as she used to when she played the part of Myra the Girl of the Night
How about the cops
The place fairly reeks with them
Hell never come while they are here know Brown thought moment Ill call them off for tonight hope to God Im doing right She looked at him long time
Slim boyish they faced each other shoulder to shoulder
His black eyes were soft now his thin lips whimsical
Youre Vivian now She nodded em phatically and as if she liked it
Just writer of songs
VivianMaster of Mel ody and love you for it Then her mood changed she smiled grimly
hope tonight though that youre just Detective Vee BrownKiller of Men Black eyes grew narrow hard cold points showed
He opened his mouth but didnt speak
He took me by the arm
When we reached the door she said The revuemy revue
How goes it Rotten Vee said
It does nt go at all And suddenly brightening
Reh frriftay But tonight
After tonight will be able to write CHAPTER TWO Outside the Window YYTHEN we crouched on the fire escape that night Vee Brown said have nt tipped my hand to the police havent even said word to the Ive got boys on that roof of course for dont fancy being shot in the back looked into the room
Gertrude la Palatin sat under light smoking
It was getting very close to eight
Brown spoke again
Damn itl Dean never felt like this before
Im as nerv ous as star on her first night
And more to himself than to me wonder if Im half in love with the girl smiled but said nothing
Then tried How are you going to work it
liad thought to change my plans he said
See that closet
Well we could have hidden in there
If it was trap of any kindI mean trap for mewed have had the jump on them He shook his head
But decided against that
We can see every bit of the room from here and By God Dean shes won der
Look at her sitting there smoking and reading
And Ill lay you ten to one shes actually reading This as she turned page
Shes remarkable woman And stubborn as hell
Imagine want ing to run with that Teddy Melrose
Why the Murder Syndicate wouldnt The words died
He moved forward gently touched the curtains as the rap came on the door
Gertrude la Palatin came to her feet slowly laid the book down on the small table
Her movements were easy assured but the color had suddenly gone from her face
Her green eyes darted one quick glance at the window
Then she walked over to the door and opened it
The man wore black slouch hat long coat and muffler high about his neck
But even so recognized him
The flat features were those of Big Boy Wal lace
Neither of his hands showed both of them were hidden beneath the long very longblack topcoat
The girl played her part well
She fell back slightly muttered Oh and then was expecting someone else The man said Yes know
You were expecting Vee Brown and so cun There was queer sort of gurgle in his throat
If was laugh there was not much mirth in Hes in the doset eh lady
Theres hundred grand and getaway in this for me
Well see how your boy friend likes this Even as he spoke he threw open his coat
Then things happened with rapid ky that was astounding and left me silent stunned there on the fire escape my gun frozen tight in my hand
Wallaces coat just fell back and both Ms hands raised
His body swung almost with that single motion and before even realized that those hands held guna Thompson machine gunlead was vomit ing from its blazing glaring mouth
thought of Browns idea that we hide in the doset and my stomach completely turned over for was looking at that partly open doset door and the multitude of tiny holes that had perforated the wood from top to bottom
The man turned
Furtive eyes sought the window for one brief moment
He spoke to Pal even as he poked that Tom my gun almost flat against her chest
Its quick job for you too lady but There was roar
All hell broke loose in my head
Big Boy Wallace seemed to straighten
My eyes blinked shut and open hut just before Wallace dropped to the floor saw the blood coining from his ear knew that Browns bullet had gone Dime Detective Magazine straight itato the mans brain almost di rectly through his eardrum
We were in the room then
Brown dragged the Tommy gun from twisted dead fingers
DAL was rocking back and forth try ing to steady herself stretching out hand for wall that wasnt there
steadied her and she clung to me
Brown stood looking down at the body sadly
Pal spoke
Im all right
Im all right
Ive seen death before quick and sudden and She was crying as she pushed her tousled head against my chest
It was terrible when he died
thought for moment it would be me and then those eyeswatching me
Then they were sightless and he was dead Yes dead Brown said bitterly
The only man who knewand he died
If you had only quit the show let him come alone let The girl turned
Youre thinking of him then not of me
Youre the finest shot in the world youve said so your self Her voice raised
Then why not have wounded him shot him in the With the gun against your chest And that was all of that
The manager was there actors and actresses and stage hands all crowding in the little doorway
Then Meyer and the police
But it was who took Pal to another dressing room
It was who tried to comfort her
And her one thought was of Vee Brown
He blames me she sobbed
He blames me
He cant love me
He Pal stopped her Vees greatest ambition is to get the leader of this Mur der Syndicate
He cant work at his music he cant sleep
And tonight
Well if it were someone besides you he might have shot the gun from Wallaces hand
With you he gave it all up
All the things he had built on the capture of Wallace alive
All to save you He did
He did She gripped my arm tight
Thats true
He did
But hell hate me for it Then her maid dozens of other people
The police reporters cameramen and the medical examiner
And somehow the ex planation which must have started with Brown that Wallace came there to kill him because he was so dose on his trail
Meyer wrung his hands
There will be no show he spluttered
No show tonight
No one out there knows whats happened andandthey are hanging to the rafters Brown spoke
His lips curled and guess only Pal and got his meaning
Oh therell be show he said to Mey er
Quit on the last nightthe big night
He turned to the door
Pal came to her feet
Her little body stiffened her hands denched at her sides
She moved quickly to the mirror sat down dabbed at her face
She was smil ing when she turned to Meyer
Brown is right she said
There will be show After that What
Inspector Ramsey of the police
Morti mer Doran the district attorney
Slaps on the back for Brown applauseyes even begrudgingly from Ramsey
The City of New York wanted Big Boy Wal lace more than any other public enemy and it wanted him dead
Vee Brown had ddivered him dead
And Vee Brown wanted him living
could see his face when they praised him treated him as hero snapped his picture
How he had wanted Big Boy Wallace alive
We saw the show
And the audience didnt know until they left the theater that Big Boy Wallace ace of murderers had been shot to death in Gertrude la Palatins dressing room less than forty five minutes before the curtain went up
Gertrude la Palatin was superb
Red Friday CHAPTER THREE Death Threat fpWO weeks later Yee Brown was working at his secret trade and his shame as he so often facetiously called it
There was no doubt that he made more money on single song than he did in whole year as detective assigned to the district attorneys office
Now he was doing the lyrics for an entire revue in which Gertrude la Palatin was to star
As for me
sat in the living room just beyond the closed door of the music room and let my mind wander
My paper lay at my feet my pipe had long since gone out between my teeth as listened to the infrequent strumming on the piano
The Murder Syndicate
Crimelands latest racket
Simple and direct it had the police buffaloed the press brutal in its denunciation of the police
And Vee Brown
It had him working on Pals Revue
There were no two ways about it
Crime murder violence action all stimulated him to write music com pose those sentimental song hits under the name of VivianMaster of Melody
The Murder Syndicate
So simple so direct so vicious and sure
And its lead er now free from the possible chance of being caught was picking his victims with rare shrewdness
First the simple direct note that they were to pay certain amount of money
Pay or diethat was the threat
And to make it doubly effec tive murdered men were found on the streets of the city
The victims of this ghastly extortion received notes next day that the Syndicate had acted struck at one who did not pay or who had notified the police
Many had paid of course
How many it was impossible to tell
shuddered shook myself and remembered that it was not so long ago that Inspector Ram sey and myself had sat bound in chairs waiting to be nailed living to the wall of house and left there to die
We had nothing to pay
We were to be just an advertisement
Screaming heads in the papers that the Murder Syndicate had struck
warning picture lesson to those who would not pay
Our deaths hadnt gone through of course
Those who would have killed us had died by Browns gun
But the leader whose identity we did not know had es caped
And now he was waiting to strike again
The bell to the upstairs door to our penthouse rang
It was Mortimer Do ran
And behind his huge fleshy form was the muscular figure of Inspector Ramsey
They were grim determined looking
With them was third man
The district attorney generally an af fable man did not bother to shake hands with me courtesy that he seldom neg lected
Inspector Ramsey simply grunt ed said nothing
let them in didnt speak at first looked toward the music room
knew that Brown didnt like to be disturbed when he was working
But now no sound came from the music room
Mortimer Doran jerked thumb at the third man who followed them in
knew him of course
It was Teddy Mel rose the former playboy and millionaire who like shrewder and brighter men had lost his fortune
But he had been threat ened by the Murder Syndicatewith the hope guess that he could raise the money from his wealthy aunt in Phila delphia
He had been near death with us that terrible night while we waited to be nailed to the wall of the empty house
Mortimer Doran chased away all thoughts of my not calling Brown by his next words
Its another Condon
Another threat of death by the Murder Syndicate
Sev eral prospective victims have been good enough citizens and brave enough men to Dime Detective Magazine bring in their letters
want to see Vee saw them seated saw that our only servant Wong was already mixing drinks
Then walked quickly to the music room jerked open the door and closed it behind me
DROWN swung quickly from the win dow
He wasnt angry at the intru sion and broke out before could speak Its gone
Every bit of it gone
It was pounding in my head demanding to be thumped out and jotted down
Now hell
Its the inactivity He laughed sort of bitterly
If thats all thats worrying you for get it
The Murder Syndicate has struck again Struck
Black eyes brightened his slender fig ure jerked erect
By God you act as if you were glad Glad He seemed puzzled and then Well perhaps am
But not in die per sonal sense you mean
Certainly we cant catch the leader of this Murder Syndicate while he remains inactive
Hes got to strike Dean hes got to strike to be struck
Now what happened Nothing yet shook my head
That isnot murder think
But enough has happened to bring Mortimer Doran here with face as long as your own threat of death eh Brown rubbed his hands together
Thats something indeed thats something
It means Dean that our Murder Syndicate can no longer collect with simple warnings
It is neces sary to act But cane
Ramsey is here with him of course And Teddy Melrose is here too Brown frowned
He ran out on us last time after all his braggadocio about helping the police Vee said hes not used to murder and violence
In way am and after that ordealthat waiting to be nailed
alive to wallId have run out myself if were able to run Perhaps you would and perhaps this Melrose can be of some help
And almost as we reached the door Hes Ramseys pet Ramseys find
So sup pose Im against him from the start laughed
You cant blame him for wanting to stick close to the police No
cant blame him Dean for being frightened
But he doesnt need protection
The Murder Syndicate is purely business
They leave alone those who run with the police
They are out for easy money
But Ill see Mortimer Doran and our good friend Ramsey Mortimer Doran did shake hands with Vee Brown
His placid round face worked through many expressions
Then he said It happened again
The Mur der Syndicate is to strike tonight Seven people brought in letters He extended the missives to Brown
You dont have to be careful
The fingerprint expert has gone over them And found nothing Fpund plentybut it means nothing It seldom does Brown grinned opened one letter then the others handed each to me
They were all the same
Typed carefully and neatly
Sir You will have the amount stipulated in previous communications ready to be paid in cash by the next notice
We respectfully call your attention to the fact that small delinquent who has communicated with the police dies tonight His death will be rather horribleand we hope effective
May we call your attention to your morn ing mail for further details
Very truly yours THE MURDER SYNDICATE
Peculiarly worded threat eh Teddy Melrose shot in his fishlike eyes flashing at us through the film that clouded them
Did you get one this time Red Friday No
didnt Brown ran through all of them
We have some good citizens then Ramsey shrugged his shoulders
But how many got these notes and are pay ingor waiting to see what happens Well said Brown we have seven letters
Surely the Syndicate will not know that all of the seven men have come to the police
Some one of them will re ceive later note indicating the payoff Yes yes said Mortimer Doran
But what of this present threat
Some poor devil tonight
Must we sit idly by and wait until man is murderedhor ribly murdered Since we cant prevent crime let us sit down and wait for it to happen said Vee Brown
Youve taken every step as outlined it He grinned at Doran
The district attorney looked at Ram sey
Everyone is covered he asked
Everyone Ramseys eyes widened
So the suggestion came from Brown then
Well can account for every name on our listeven the ones supplied by the government TITELROSE raised his eyebrows
The federal authorities are in this Certainly Ramsey snapped
The department of justice is peculiar that way
They dont like the United States mails being used for threats of murder extortion or even blackmail Will you wait here Mr Doran Brown asked
Doran said as he moved toward the door My place is at my office
just wanted to let you know and see if you had any suggestion as to whom the victim might be Hardly said Brown
And with smile Wait
Im willing to bet there will be no murder tonight
Weve done every thing to prevent it Hell said Melrose
If he flunks out on this the Syndicate is through washed up after the last fiasco
Its wonder Brown he doesnt take crack at you attempt your life He did said Brown
He did And with the curving lips and flippant air that always annoyed me And found it quite amusing
You see shot his agent right through the center of the ear Ramseys mouth hung open
He start ed to speak then didnt
But he looked over his shoulder as the three men left The door had hardly closed when Mortimer Doran returned alone
That was true about Wallace then
You think the Murder Syndicate sent him Im sure of it said Vee
Now tell mewhy does Ramsey cart Melrose around with him WellDoran stroked his chin looked to see that the hall door was closed Melrose very nearly led him to this mur derer before
Between you and me think Melrose has received another threat or learned something Vee Brown frowned
Hes shrewd man he said
If he can make suck er out of Ramsey well and good And rubbing his chin He may have some thing up his sleeve
The reward is fairly big Doran nodded
Ludwig Loudons familyhe was one of the first to be found nailed upadded cool twenty five thousand to it yesterday and news paper jumped it another ten He rubbed at his forehead
wish theyd cut it out
Cant they see its not question of money Its question of money with Teddy Melrose
He makes no bones about that JIJORTIMER DORAN hesitated held his hand on the doorknob finally blurted out Its like this Vee
Teddy Melrose has been seeing lot of Gertrude la Palatin lately Dime Detective Magazine Yes
Browns thin eyebrows raised
Wellyon see its Tather well known that yon and she And suddenly clap ping hand down on Vees shoulder Shes fine girl and youre fine fellow and And said Vee
Certainly his man ner didnt invite further talk on that sub ject
But that didnt deter Mortimer Doran
And women will talk He paused then went on hurriedly
Not that think she would or that she hears any thing from you to talk about
But was wondering if Ramsey put Melrose on her And you were thinking said Brown that youd rather have the head of this Murder Syndicate caught by the As office than by Ramsey
Anything else Browns voice was abrupt
Doran stif fened then smiled
Nothing else along that lineexcept that Teddy Melrose is very engaging man Brown grinned
Dont yon worry about me or your office
Go home and sleep And sleep said the
With some poor devil about to fee crucified dont think there will be any poor devil murdered like that tonight
The police certainly should be able to prevent it
We dont know the intended victim thats true
But we should know the hired assassin tonight hope youre right
God hope youre right Mortimer Doran said with feeling
Everythings been done that could be done
Good night CHAPTER FOUR The Murder Syndicate TVHEN Mortimer Doran had gone Brown turned to me
Teddy Mel rose eh
Pal has picked strange com pany
Hes become sort of stool pigeon for Ramsey You know
Pal told you she was going to play him along
Shes as hot on this thing as you are as anxious to get the head of the Murder Syndicate
And Mel rose knows his way around
After all his interest may be in the reward
Theres nothing bad about Teddy Melrose
met him in better days
Hes selling invest ments now and understand that con sidering conditions hes doing well Nothing bad and nothing good about him Brown agreed
And suddenly Pal hasnt been around Oh come
Vee told him flat
You saved her life of course but you put her in the position of needing that life saved then practically blamed her for being there knowI know Brown was ir ritated
My name and picture in all the papers the hero of the city
Shot Big Boy Wallace to death while he held machine gun
feel like fool
dont know why but fed that the head of the Murder Syndicate is laughing at me has made fool out of me But how
Thats it
dont know how switched the subject
About this death tonight
What makes you fed it wontcant happen Brown hesitated then hurst out with Hes fiend Dean and quite capa ble of nailing living man to wall
But he hasnt acted himselfat least alone
Hes hired others
First it was just by passing along the name of the victim through Rossimire the jewder and the name of the criminal he had picked for the job
Later perhaps he made direct contact with his murderers maybe through Wallace maybe by phone certainly keeping himsdf unknown to them
Heres the point Dean
There are hundreds thousands of men in New York Red Friday City who will shoot man to death for price stick knife in him toss him from cliff beat him to death
But just how many of these criminals would nail living man to wall
man has got to be more than criminal to do that Hes got to be pretty vicious Right
degenerate madman and the occasional fiend who takes pleasure in inflicting horrible torture
believe our leader of the Murder Syndicate is such man man with hate of his fellowmen
Now how is he going to find men to kill like that
Certainly not just by chance
Hes got to use professional talent known criminals Brown paused
And such professional fiendishness is rare
Every one who would do such an actevery professional criminal mean who might be known to the head of this Murder Syndicateis also known to the police
Wallace was one of them and he is dead
glance over the police records located others prison records found us more
So we were able to make up list of thirtythree known criminals who would not be above crucifying victim
We ran down that list have been at it ever since Loudon was found so murdered in his own house
Six of them are dead eleven in prison four deported four in state hospitals for the insane
That leaves eight
Of those eight three have been lo cated out of the state and the other five have been shadowed day and night
Oh Im not saying the list is complete but it seems to me thatin hunting out men for his purpose criminals that are known and who will go to the lengths he demands this murder fiend will pick one of those men
There you are Dean
He has thou sands to choose from for murder but hes limited when it comes to nailing liv ing human beings to walls
If he ap proaches these men or if any one of these men try to actwhy we will get them tonight And you think this Murder Syndicate leader is one of these remaining five No said Brown dont
think hes man who has started from scratch
Well known in the underworld of course but not suspected as criminal
man who suddenly saw the idea conceived the Murder Racket and understands the fear and terror created in other victims of his extortion by such horrible murders
may be wrong but dont think so
It takes more than criminal mind to kill even an enemy like that
So dont think murder will take place tonight
Even if we dont know the victim we may know and so have shadowed the prospective murderer TROWN had hardly finished when the phone rang
went across to the table and lifted it
The voice was even steady slightly sarcastic and unnatural
Is this Vee Brown the great detec tive No said
But The voice said This is the Murder Syndicate After silence stammered The the head of the Murder Syndicate You may call me that But am all of it
The Murder Syndicate
Put that toy detective on if hes there Brown was already at the phone had taken it from my hand pulled me close to listen
This is Vee Brown talking His voice was calm even quiet The voice laughed it was even pleas ant laugh
have called to return your very kind favor My favor Certainly
You are evidently one of those rare bighearted persons who do ing an enemy good deed dismisses it from his mind
meanabout Wallace
Big Boy Wallace
Living he would have done me lot of harm
He was too care ful for me to kill so it was kind of you Dime Detective Magazine to do it for me
You see he knew who really am So you sent him to me to be killed Yes The Murder Syndicate went on easily
It was rather amusing
Im quite gambler
really didnt know which one of you would die
It hardly mattered did it
With Wallace dead he couldnt tell you with you dead Wallace wouldnt have you to tell He chuckled now
But liked the way it turned out
would have had to pay Wallace rather large sum of money for killing you
As it was got Wallaoe killed for nothing How could you be sure wouldnt take him alive The little lady would assure me of that and Wallacesshall say impetu ous nature
You see told him you would be in the closet moments pause
And do you know half sus pected you would be there just fool enough to improve on my plans Im sorry wasnt there to see it
But the papers gave most vivid account
They made man out of you while made sap out of me It was as if Brown thought aloud
Exactly Now wish to return the favor let you know where to find the body
Yes yesI know
Youve had seven letters from my clients and youve spent weeks trying to think as would think
The men professional criminals suited for my particular job And gruff ly Well you were right
Most crimi nals are fools thats why work un known
You made things difficult for me
Have your attention Yes Vee said in low voice as if he were afraid the man would hang up
Im listening quite carefully Good
But you forgot Mr Vee Brown that there are hundreds thou sands right in the city who will knock man on the head for very few dollars and deliver him at certain place
Oh abhorred the physical end of ita long pausebut nailed up mymy adver tisement and hes ready for exhibition tonight Browns head jarred back and so did mine
Who is he
Where is he He was hosiery salesman from Illi nois with wife and three small chil dren
So picked him Why Why
The papers will make it higger storymore pictures
The wife and children you know
And my clients will be more impressed
But it is only the beginning
Now the one big splurge
The Murder Syndicate will strike once more strike at one of the big names of die cityand so collect fortune But this man
Where is he Oh
Staten IslandMidland Beach
bungalow there
Now dont forget the big date
Friday the thirteenth
No no
Im not superstitious but many other peo ple are
like to work upon the imagina tion of people
Take care of Miss la Pala tin
Good night TEE BROWN put down the receiver and looked at me
was right he said
He made sap out of me
Got me to eliminate his greatest danger kill the one man who threatened his existence
But you said there wouldnt he any murder tonight any Brown turned on me
And was wrong he said
Just dead wrong And trying to buck up But hes come out Dean is doing the job himself
Theres something in thatsomething in that He was lifting the phone calling Morti mer Doran
It was scarcely nine oclock
remember the ride downtown the im patience of Brown on the ferry his standing there silent in the bow looking up at the pilot house as if to try to hurry the lumbering craft But as Wong our Chinese chauffeur and houseman drove Red Friday out through Stapleton we talked
was wondering said how this Murder Syndicatefor he calls himself thatknew so much about the police de partment about what you do And was wondering that too He shook his head thoughtfully said then Think of the effect this will have on those who have not paid If Mortimer Doran can keep it quiet out of the papers why Brown shook his head
Im afraid our murderer is too good businessman for that
Hell But whats this
Not police escort motorcycle cop had turned followed and hailed us
Youre Detective Brown he asked
Ive been sent out to direct you Then they found something They have The cop nodded in the darkness
We were called just few minutes before the district attorney tele phoned he was coming over You were called here on the Island Thats right
lad from the Clarion found the body
Said he got tip and came over
think his name was Clancey or Geary said and Brown agreed
As we followed the cop down the high way Brown said You see
He tipped off Geary
Told him the exact location and Geary had look at the body before he notified the police
Yes the Murder Syndicate will get its full share of pub licity
Frontpage stuff that no money could buy And we were there
We didnt have to follow the cop any longer
The lights of cars the movement of uniformed men the ambulance
And by the door of the boardedup bungalowfor the season was long since pastInspector Ramsey
Theres your hunch Ramsey jerked thumb toward the door
dont know what the boys who have been shadowing your suspects will have to say but gave orders to get me full report at once Thats right Browns voice was dead
But quite unnecessary
The lead er of the Murder Syndicate stepped out himself tonight Brown paused
Is it very bad Bad Ramsey swung on him
Ive been on the force for years never heard tell of anything like it
The hospi tal doctor says hes been nailed there for two days Dead that long looked at Brown
But it was Ramsey who spoke
did nt say dead His voice choked
said nailed there Hes been dead only few hours
Rigor mortis just set in Brown straightened stiffened turned toward the door
Ramsey grabbed me by the arm
Its no grief to me what you do Con don
But go in that house now and Ill take my oath you spend the best part of month wishing you hadnt CHAPTER FIVE The Man on the Wall TD AMSEY was right exactly right
did go in and did wish that had nt
There is nothing to tell nothing to write of what saw in that room
Let me simply say that went out sat on the single step that led to the rear porch and was violently sick and without shame
How Brown stayed in that room dont know but he did stay
When he left he was bending forward reading the words on the note that had been on the mans chest had read the big letters of coursejust the words THE MUR DER SYNDICATE
Cleary of the Clarion came over and sat down beside ma
got tip Con don he said
You know how news paper work is
And came right out found him like that
There was mes sage under the big printed words
It took Dime Detective Magazine me hell of time to write it down my hand shook like the devil
Listen to this
It gave the lads name and address and said he was planted there raving and screaming Thursday evening at eight fifteen
Fortyeight hours before he died
Listen to the rest of the note He produced small flash and read aloud from some notes he had made
This man defied the Murder Syndi cate
He did not pay
He went to tfie police
He is of little importance to any one but his wife and three children
On the thirteenth of the month the Murder Syndicate will strike at another one of the citys most prominent citizens
He has already sought the police sought the protection of the district attorney and Detective Vee Brown
This protection will not help him
Remember the date
Friday the thirteenth
One of the citys most prominent men
After that date the same fate the same death for all those who do not pay
You pay or you dieThe Murder Syn dicate Cleary finished folded the sheet carefully and put it in his pocket
Make anything out of it Condon If he thought to take advantage of my condition or not didnt know
only shook my head
Everything was turning over inside of me
Hell said Cleary this thing will raise stink to high heaven
It He swung looked around to the front of the cottage
Heres the Aold Mortimer Doran himself
Ill see if can get statement catch him off his guard just as he comes out And Cleary left me
lyTORTIMER DORAN left his own LTJ car and rode back to town with us
He was silent sunk far back in corner of the rear seat
couldnt stand the silence
Finally broke it said But Vee
Why all that stuff on the note
He never went to the police was never even threatened
What good does the note do then We know he didnt come to the police Dean but the men the Syndicate demands money fromGod knows how many of themdont know it
Theyll think our statement to the papers just an attempt to cover our own inefficiency Our own inefficiency Mortimer Do ran said
Perhaps they are right
So the murderer called you on the telephone called Cleary of the Clarion too There was leak Brown said
This Murder Syndicate knew of our sudden interest in certain type of criminal and was therefore smart enough to avoid con tact with any of them
Of course it might be possible to trace the man or men who delivered the victim to the shack but therere thousands who would do that for few hundred dollarsnot knowing the truth of course
Tomorrow when they do learn the truthwell its hardly possible that they will be anxious to talk and impossible that they know who the man was who hired them
But its the leak that interests me
If we could trace that Leak
Hell Mortimer Doran was jarred into animation
Youre talking like child
You know as much about police business as do and damn sight more
We must have used hundred men in looking up those records trailing men sending wires all over the country Brown nodded called to Wong to stop the car leaned out and bought paper from boy who was bellowing Extra He snapped on the dome light
We all looked down at that paper and all re mained silent for the space of full min ute hardly breathing
For there spread across the whole front page of the Cla rion was picturea photograph of the frightful thing had seen two short hours before
Red Friday Vee Brown said finally So Cleary had cameraman with him
He telephoned in his story and the lad rushed back with the plate even before Geary notified the police The skunk said Mortimer Doran
Brown shook his head
Hes doing his job just as Im doing mine and you are doing yours
His is to gather the sensa tional And to me You see Dean the inhuman monster you call mad saw to it that the advertising value of hishis murder was fully taken advantage of And theres no way to find him This from Doran as we stopped before his house
Only one can think of now Vee answered absently
Locate house where this picturehe tapped the front page of the paperis kept and framed and well have our murder monster Doran stood at the curb and looked at Vee
By Godl he said
Youre not trying to be funny Brown shook his head
Any man who could treat another human so with money the only motive must have the type of brain that would glory in keeping such reminder of his act And suddenly Theyll ride hell out of us in the papers but think the little salesman from Illi nois did not die in vain
think his death will lead to the Murder Syndicate How
Can give that to the papers am not surehow
But think knowwhen
hope to know positively tomorrow Mortimer Dorans voice was not pleas ant
You think you know when
When is that The end of next week Mr Doran
Friday the Thirteenth We were gone then turning across town toward Park Avenue and home
Vee said youre not just guess inghoping Both He looked at me in the dark ness
But Ill know tomorrow
If the Murder Syndicate runs true to form Ill know What do you meantrue to form WellBrown stroked his chinyou remember when Ludwig Loudon died
Each of the Murder Syndicatesshall call them clientsreceived letter the following morning and the letter an nounced the name of their victim and what time the body would be discovered remember nodded
Several brought in their letters
But theres little hope there
The Murder Syndicate was wise enough to mail those letters so they would not be delivered until long after the victim was discovered dead
You dont expect to trace the murderer back through those letters or letters that peo ple may bring to the police tomorrow No said Brown
But Ive got an ideaan idea dont believe even the Murder Syndicate will think of He was opening the door of our apartment stop ping listening sniffing the air
We have he said visitor Who went clumsily for my gun
Who has key
Just PalGertrude la Palatin dashed into the room ahead of him
CHE was there stretched out on the couch
She looked at me smiled sent ring of smoke toward the ceiling
It was the tobacco then that Vee had smelled
She took my hand squeezed it winked at me as Vee entered the room
If he was glad to see her he didnt show it
He said So youre not working with me any more
That it Not with you but for you She sat up now
If the mountain wont come to MohammedReally Vee thought youd have more nerve and come around He stood and looked at her his face hard his lips tight his eyes black gleam Dime Detective Magazine ing slits
Then he smiled
Damn it
think Im jealous Of Teddy Melrose She came to her feet
love you for that
Andyes its not Vivian the song writer whos jealous
Its the coldblooded killing dick Vee Brown
Id have believed He grinned then
dont like him
Hes playboy gone broke
Where does he get the money to take you around
Not from his aunt No She shook her head
And not from Ramseythat is all of it
Believe it or not Vee Ive been footing most of the bills Vee frowned and when she waited Yes
Tell me about it
didnt think he had come down that far
Hes making some moneynot lot but some Hes not gigolo if thats what you mean Pal told him
He made me straight business offer
went out with him first to find out what could about Ramsey
Melrose isnt bad sort Vee
He talks of building up his fortune again
Just needs money to startone big bank roll
And that roll he hopes will be the reward money for the capture of the head of the Murder Syndicate But Pal hes useless
He was threat ened got letter telling him how to pay and he and Ramsey and Dean went through with it and nearly died
Teddy Melrose broke loose and ranjust as saved them
He hid like scared rabbit outside the house we picked him up later with the car Gertrude la Palatin said While Ted dy Melrose was hiding someone came to the window of that house and that some one was the leader of the Murder Syn dicate
He shot through the window and killed Ulrich Rossimire just as he was about to tell you the leaders name
Re member that Id hardly forget it said Vee
So what And Pal threw her bombshell
Teddy Melrose told you he saw man running from that window but he didnt tell you just how near he was to that man or that he saw the mans face God no Brown swung half shook the girl
His eyes blazed
No he didnt tell me that
He recognized the face The girl grinned
Now arent you glad you didnt scare me out of this racket Come Pal Vee sat down on the couch
It isnt the time for nonsense Sol Ill tell it from the beginning
Ramsey sicked Teddy Melrose on me
Ramsey more than suspects was active with you in various cases and he found out that was often with Ulrich Rossi mire
Teddy Melrose told me that the second time he took me out
He put it very bluntly and very straight
Im sent out after you by Ramsey and youd better watch him he told me
He thinks youve got some kind of past but isnt sure
NowI know youve got past
mixed around pretty much and knew most of the big shots in the rackets
If Ramsey knew what know about you hed send you back to prison Brown jarred off the couch
Teddy Melrose knowsknows you escaped from prison See Vee cut in
You were going to fix that with the with the gov ernor
Now HPHE girl said He didnt say he knew and he didnt threaten to send me back to prison
It might have been blackmail but he made it very much of business proposition
He thinks he recognized the head of the Murder Syndicate and of course realizes that hell have to have evidence
He told me that he was prac tically broke suggested that pay our expenses travelling around the hot spots until he saw the man he thought he recog nized again
Then was to meet this Red Friday man go around with him get the evidence or at least find out what could And you were to split the reward money suppose put that one in
Pal laughed
He wasnt that generous but he did promise to reimburse me for our little dinners and suppers out of the reward He warned you of course against saying anything about this to me Pal puckered her lips
Thats the strange part of it
He didnt
He simply suggested that say nothing to you until we were ready to strike
Then he wanted me to tell you
He says you dont like him Vee
But he rather likes youat least believes in youand trusts you enough to take your word that if the arrest or the killing is yours the money is his And if you wouldnt agree he threat ened to tell what he knew of your past No she shook her headhe didnt
He just seemed to think me fitted for the job thats to be done
But he made no threats
But suggested threats eh She seemed to think moment
Im not sure that he did
Hes cold blooded as hell Deanno doubt about that
Won ders if we stall off while will the reward be larger
Cynical too but thenhes set on getting back at the friends who de parted with his money
He told me Vee that hes suggested investments to people that netted them fortune and now they wont even recognize him just give him quick nod
It seems almost like an obsession with him Sounds sort of childish Vee said
Yes it does
But its understandable What did you agree onwith him Well Pals lips twisted slightly took him up paid our way
And And Vee encouraged
And tonight had dinner with the suspect the man Teddy Melrose saw run ning from the window after Ulrich Ros simire was shot dead at your feet was startled and shewed it Brown was startled too
His name Vee gulped
You know his name Of course she said
Johnny Fitz patrick DONT know why laughed but did
Maybe it was because of the in congruity of the name
Hardly one youd pick for the name for fiend
Brown said Johnny Fitzpatrick
Well known in the rackets smartest and most dangerous of aH the exbootleggers Was he on your list asked
No no
He wasnt And the last man Id think of putting there
He cashed in with Repeal and understood was Irving on preRepeal profits
But he never
It seems incredible
Pal said Thats what told Teddy Melrose after met the man
Hes rather nice rather quiet
little gray around the templesand seems glad to be out of it all And what did Mdrose say
Melrose said there had to be first time for everything
That few years ago it would seem impossible to him to be sitting there letting me pay for his food and wine And hes right
Brown finally nodded
Yes theres got to be first time for everything
Youll have to cut it Pal youre in great danger
If Teddy Melrose has found the right man And knew Vee was thinking of the message of the Murder Syndicate that had come over the phone
Take care of Miss la Palatin
cant quit it Green eyes flashed
Youre afraid of Mdrosethat hell talk about your past
Thats why you cant quit dont think so she said
think its something stronger than that Its the Dime Detective Magazine past itself Vee
keep telling myself that its over and done with but it isnt
Its there after the years
There are times when want to open my window and yell it for all the world to hear
Im crook
Ive been in jail
Im sham and No no
Its as if Id been seeking freedom and now feel that Im finding it She clenched her hands
know what happened tonight She pointed toward the radio
It came in over the air
Im going through with it
Ive got to go through with it
Ive got to know hes caught or dead
Then Ill be free She turned fled toward the hall and the door swung back
wanted to tell you wanted you to know ifif anything happens to me Brown let her go without making move to stop her
He simply took the Clarion from his pocket and looked long and steadily at the picture
She has to do it Dean he said after while
In way shes like me
The things gripping her tearing inside her body
Something she cant get rid of
Ive killed menmany men
By God Dean
Id die willingly tomorrow tonightif first could have that mon ster lying at my feet and pump lead into his stomach said without thinking without mean ing anything Why in the stomach He said simply enough Because it hurts more in the stomach CHAPTER SIX The Letter rpHE next morning Brown was up early
We had visitor
He was an excited nervous little man who had inherited money and lived out on Long Island
His name was Seymour Brentwood and he looked every letter of the name
He was talking when came into the room
hope the things not joke Mr Brown
hope one of the neighbors wouldnt perpetrate such joke
YetI came to you becausewell didnt want my name tossed about in the press
My wifes Stevens you know
The Massa chusetts Stevens
Her family wouldnt like it bit Did you show it to your wifeany one No didnt Though the room was not warm the man rubbed great beads of perspiration from his head
Its ghastly joke though
had just read my paper when the note came Brown had passed the note to me and was reading it
Dear Mr Brentwood You have already read in your morn ing paper of the unfortunate and horrible death of Janies Francis Stacey in the shack on Staten Island
If you will ex amine the post mark on this envelope you will note that the letter was received in the United States post office several hours before the dead body was found
You have been selected by THE MUR DER SYNDICATE to pay the sum of twentyfive thousand dollars in cash or meet the same unpleasant fate
Therefore it is necessary for you to get together that amount in bills of small denominations before noon on Saturday the Fourteenth of the present month
On that date you will receive in the first mail full instructions as to how to turn this money over to the Murder Syndicate
The papers no doubt have also informed you that on the night of Friday the Thir teenth very prominent citizen will die
On the morning of the Fourteenth you will receive letter telling you who this man is and the post mark of this letter will con vince you that the dead man was alive and well the very moment that letter to you was received by the United States post office
He has appealed to the police
But we have planned his death and nothing can save him
If after this man dies and you read the letter you are not convinced that our demands must be met we can give you but one more demonstration
That isto nail your own living body to wall
THE MURDER SYNDICATE
Red Friday You see the point dont you
Just as said But why doesnt the Murder Syndicate mail the letters sooner if they want to convince their victims the police cant protect the man Good old stupid Dean Vee ignored our agitated visitor
The thing is simple
If we knew the victim we could very easily protect him
Only the Murder Syn dicate knows the victim until after the crie has been committed
He has laid his plans picked his victim and is sure enough to name him in letter before he is killed or even taken by him
Partly conceit Dean but mostly good business
It is rather horrifying for those threat ened to know that when that letter was written the victim was alive and well
Also it impresses them with the Murder Syndicates inevitability
He did the same thing at the time of Ludwig Loudons death DROWN turned to the nervous little man
Its not joke Mr Brent woodfar from it he said seriously
He crossed the room and laid both his hands on the mans shoulders
You are for tunate in coming to me
can save your life and can save your money
You must not tell what was in this letter to anyone not anyone Vee folded the letter and put it in his pocket
If you obey that simple instruction promise you you will be quite safe But they saythe letter says hethis man went to the police and He pointed at Browns pocket If you notice the envelope that contained the letter its slightly blurred but the post mark is sixthirty
put magnifying glass on it You see Dean Vee half threw at me
The very fact that this Murder Syndicate can convince his victims that his letter was written some hours before the body was found strikes them with sort of awe terror
And of course they believe that the murdered man is not only known to the police but has sought police protection
Even such stouthearted citizen as Mr Brentwood feels the in fluence Iwell Brentwood stammered felt it duty to come
Im not afraid Mr Brownhardly that His laugh was shrill and false
But my wife you know
Her familythe Stevens
Good God
To be nailed to wall like that
Cant the policecant you Stop it
Certainly Brown nodded
You are in an enviable position Mr Brentwood
Upon your actions from now on until the night of the Thirteenth rests the life of man perhaps the lives and happiness of many menbut at least the life of the one mentioned in this letter Yes yes
But dont quite under stand Bent shoulders straightened slight ly
If he didnt get Browns words he got the tone of his voiceone of respect admirationand he liked it
And thats even nobler said Brown
Doing this for the good of your city and not fully understanding it
Your promise
You will do nothing
Act as you always acted Wellyes He took Browns hand
Dean take Mr Brentwood out the back entrance through the court and see him safely in cab got Brentwood as far as the door when he turned jerked his arm free made couple of false starts and finally got the words out
II want to do what can Mr Brown
But must think of my wife
II might draw the money from the bank
It will look like good faith That Mr Brentwood is your own business
shall treat your visit confiden tially as you requested when you came in
But if you do as say act your normal self and dont go around talking there will be no Murder Syndicate to pay Dime Detective Magazine the money to on the morning of Saturday the Fourteenth When got back to the apartment Vee Brown was rubbing his hands humming softly
Youll have to go back downstairs again
To let in Mr Wiley
You dont know him eh
Ive done business with him
You see hes about Brentwoods build age general appear ance
Theres just chance that the apart ment is watched and Brentwood was spotted coming in And you want this Wiley to come in the back and go out the front as Brent wood Not exactly
want him to go out the front as Wiley
If hes shadowed theyll know hes broker who has done business with me before GUESS it was full half hour later that Wiley had come and gone
After seeing him out the front entrance re turned to Brown with the information that man had slipped around the comer and followed Wiley in taxi
Good said Vee and as Wong came through with his bag Take it to the Newark airport Wong
Yes Dean thats right
Im making flying trip to Wash ingtona secret one too The upstairs halldoor bell rang
Go out the side entrance Wong after the gentlemen are in And to me when Wong had gone and Vee was starting for the door That will be Mortimer Doran and daresay Ramseywho is afraid may have found out something he missed And rubbing his hands Which have Dean Brown was right
Ramsey was with the and also Teddy Melrose to whom Vee was especially cordial
Im glad you came Mr Melrose
want to have word with you in private after Mr Doran and Inspector Ramsey leave Teddy Melroses eyebrows went up fish eyes stared
Yes he said
Mortimer Doran did most of the talk ing
Weve had visitors downtown
Inspector Ramsey was kind enough to call me in Brown let me read the letters Mortimer Doran held out
There were nine of them
They were all the same wordforword copies of Brentwoods letter
Only the amounts differed
thought there would be more than that Doran said
thought the Murder Syndicate with this threat about the Thir teenth was going into it wholesale Maybe he has Ramsey cut in
May be other men who got the same notes are scared stiff
Take these men here Ramsey tapped the letters
All of them well fixed and the amounts well within their means
It may be like that with many others and they intend to pay or just to sit tight and see what happens on the Thirteenth And with half sneer Mr
Doran tells me youve got things sewed up Brown so nothing will happen on the Thirteenth Perhaps have You were to let Mr Doran know for certain today understood Thats right You had any callers
Anyone with letter come straight to you Hardly Brown smiled
But Id like to interview the men who came to see you Ive got list of their names Ramsey gave it to Vee
Everything open and above board
Nowwhats your dope eh am expecting tip
Indeed Ive had the tip but Im expecting something else later in the day And turning to Doran Im sorry you spoke of this
In way meant it to be confidential Well Doran saidand Well again
had to say something Thats right Melrose spoke for the second time
Theyve given you quite Red Friday sendoff Mr Brown
Detective Vee Brown Killer of Big Boy Wallace to Ar rest Head of Murder Syndicate on the Thirteenth
Something like that
Early afternoon editions Brown looked at Doran
Doran shuffled his feet looked toward the ceiling
Then he suddenly blustered Yes gave it out
What the hell could do
The place was lousy with reporters
had to say something
And damn it
Ive given you your way in this case let you run things to suit yourself
Nowyouve got to make good Or youll take it out of my hide Friday the Thirteenth
Well dont blame you
So Sowhat Ramseys face shot for ward
Why Ill have to drag in the leader of the Murder Syndicate of course Youre going out and get him Not exactly said Vee and that twisted little smile was in one comer of his mouth
wont go out and get him
Ill sit down and let him come to me TNSPECTOR RAMSEY didnt like it
But Teddy Melrose stayed behind after they left
The door was hardly closed when Vee came back into the living room and stood facing Melrose
Melrose he said whats the racket Melrose smiled down at the diminutive detective
Thats all right he said
Miss la Palatin said she spoke to you And did you approve
Broad shoulders shrugged
Not exact ly
thought it was premature disclosing my suggestion Suggestion echoed Brown
And then You mean threat mean exactly what saidsugges tion You are in position to send Miss la Palatin to prison
You know that Melrose stiffened
am quite aware of that Then said Brown be quite aware of this
am very fond of Miss la Palatin moments pause
Maybe more than just fond of her
want to impress you Melrose
You blackmail Miss la Palatin open your mouth about her pastand Ill get you Youd kill me eh His eyes widened
By God
believe you would Believe it
blackmailer should Teddy Melroses right hand swung quickly
It was hard blow but not particularly well timed
Brown was always quick but now he only moved his head
The fist whizzed by harmlessly
Melrose grunted jarred back
He had not seenneither had Ithe gun that was there now in Vees hand planted hard into his stomach
Im sorry Mr Melrose said Brown but nature has not gifted me with great physical strength
wouldnt try another blow Melrose grinnedactually grinned
And it wasnt bad grin
Put up the gun he said
lost my head And when the gun disappeared with single quick motion There
can talk better
Im not blackmailer and didnt like the word
But see your point
Miss la Palatin can withdraw from our little understanding any time she wishes and need have no fear that Ill ever talk
To me it was simply business What do you want out of it want money
The crimes have been of ghastly nature
am shocked and horrified like anyone else
But Im not fool
want only one thing out of it He leaned forward now
want money all can getall the traffic will bear
want money
There you are
If you dont want Miss la Palatin in it get her out of itcome in yourself What about Ramsey What about him Melrose fairly flung the words at Brown
He thinks Dime Detective Magaxii hes using me and will drop me when the break comes if dont drop him first Does Ramsey know you saw this man He knows that saw man and he knows that think recognized that man
Im stalling Ramsey along He smiled
Im ostensibly trying to stir up my mem ory looking for the face saw TROWN nodded
So thats it
Thats why he didnt want me to see you alone Im not accountable to Ramsey Mel rose sort of stiffened
Nor to any man
But if you want to work with me Im willing
It seemed to me that through Miss la Palatinwho would finally con vince you was rightand then through you was the best way to work it
saw the man
know who he is
Its up to you to trap him or get confession out of him
cant do that Its Fitzpatrick eh
That seems un believable Maybe it does said Melrose
But thats the man saw fire the shot through the window that killed Ulrich Rossimire
Take it or leave it
You can have all the glory as long as get the money And after bit when Brown did not answer at once Call Miss la Palatin off if you want
Im not blackmailer
Ill never make trouble for her Brown shook his head
You dont know that girl he said
Shell never quit never lay down on the job Well Melrose said are you with me His eyes narrowed
Remember Miss la Palatin gave her word that Ill get the moneyall of it Brown extended his hand looked straight at Melrose
misjudged you guess
Yes you have my word
You get the moneyall of it Melrose held the hand moment finally dropped it How will you work it
Have him watched No not exactly
We mustnt make him suspicious
Well give him plenty of rope until next Friday night Watch him then when he goes to Melroses shudder was quite visible
tell you Brown there are times when Im scared You dont need to be
Youre too close to the police
The Murder Syndicate knows that
It would be sheer bravado to strike at you Melrose twisted up his face
Bravado or not it wouldnt do me much good if were deadlike that on wall There was more talk
Brown saying he would work it out and Melrose con tinually coming back to the question of money
And when he spoke of money he spoke of those who had robbed him
When he was gone Brown said You saw it too
Its not just greed
The man wants desperately to regain his lost place in the world
And this passion of his to start over to strut the city again may help us lot
If he went to Ramsey Ramsey with the papers at his heels would make the arrest and try to beat the truth out of Fitzpatrick You dont think it is Fitzpatrick Ive got an open mind Brown stroked his chin
You see its quite possible that the leader of this Murder Syndicate was not at the house that night and did not fire the shot through the window
Fitzpatrick might have done that yet not be the leaderand not even know who the leader is You dont think Fitzpatrick capable of How can we tell what man is cap able of
dont know what Im capable of myself
Look at it this way Dean
This leader is shrewd man and he knows that Gertrude la Palatin is very close to me
The moment he met her Red Friday wouldnt he suspect that suspected him
Granted that Fitzpatrick is this man would he believe it mere coincidence that they met
Would he have dinner with her or Hed kill her cried out suddenly
Would he Brown shook his head
Would he kill her when it was known shed been with him
Wouldnt that give to me tiie very proof seek
No he wouldnt kill her Dean
But if he isnt this leader then Pal may learn something
For if Melrose told the truththen Fitz patrick was paid by the Murder Syndicate to commit murder
Im off to Washington
Im worried about her of course but thats not good logic
Reason tells me shes safe safer than shes ever been And he was gone
EASON didnt tell me the same thing that it told Brown it didnt tell me anything at all
Things were so utterly jumbled
And thats how things stood if they did stand at all when Brown called me up from Washington and said hed have to wait over until Monday as the man he wanted to see was out of the Capitol for the weekend
It was Monday night when he came back and Tuesday night Pal had dinner with us in the apartment There was nothing new to tell about Fitz patrick
On the level Vee she told him seri ously dont know if hes onto me or not But he does seem to enjoy me And when Vee frowned dont mean just my company
Its as if he were laughing inside at something She leaned forward then
have date with him for dinner and the theater on Thursday
He told me he couldnt possibly see me Fridayhe had very important engagement He had popped that out
How did he look when he said it Browns voice was quiet but his black eyes flashed
He was smiling
Just smiling and nod ding at me almost as if it were confiden tial Brown got up and paced the room
If hes in this thing the mans fool to act like that to say what he did And after pause Fitzpatrick never was fool CHAPTER SEVEN The Monster Strikes atmosphere of tenseness and horror hung over the entire city
At least it seemed that way to me
know didnt sleep much and when did Id wake up with start bathed in perspiration with picture in my mind that only long pac ing of the room and numerous cigarettes would erase
The papers kept the thing on the front pages
If the Murder Syndicate wanted advertising they certainly got it
Such threat such menace had never hung over the city before
There were numer ous pictures of James Francis Stacey his wife and children
And Vee Brown
had trouble getting him even to make semblance of acting on the case
But did persuade him to go and interview personally every man who had come to the police with letter
Its waste of time
Dean he argued
But youre right
Ive got to do it
It would seem strange to the head of this Murder Syndicate if didnt and make him suspect that had visitor of my But what can your visitor do to help that the others cant lot Dean
whole lot
Somehow this monster knows who goes to the police and who doesnt
He lays off those who do
And dont want him to lay off our little friend Seymour Brent wood That was early in the week and Brown Dime Detective Magazine had not told me why he went to Wash ington nor could think out the reason
Pal called us up every night and twice during the day
She promised Brown that
She was still going with Fitzpatrick and was now thoroughly convinced that he was not only not the head of the Murder Syndicate but had nothing to do with it
Thursday night and the papers still carried the storythe distress of the widowthe loss of an adoring husband and worshiping father
As matter of fact Brown told me Stacey was neither good husband nor good father
He neglected his family
They were half clothed and half fed
He made good salary but he spent plen ty when he came on to the city
He liked to run around
Thats the reason he wasnt missed
It was nothing for him to disappear from his hotel for days at time
daresay some dame picked him up delivered him over to the boys who finally brought him to Staten Island
He leaned forward suddenly
Do you know what did in Washington No said eagerly
And then If youre going to tell me go ahead if youre just going to talk around things why Im going to tell you
went to see the postoffice authorities the big gun
Do you know what wanted
Dean And when didnt Lets go back to the death of Ludwig Loudon
He was killed well after midnight
The next morning several prospective clients of the Murder Syndicate received letters saying that Loudon would die and those letters were postmarked early in the evening before his death
With Stacey it was different
The letters were not only posted long after he was taken but four to six hours before he was found
With the next victim the Murder Syndicate has promised to send its letter while the man is alive and free
You see the point confessed that didnt XTEE stroked his chin
Well if could have one of those letters in my hand naming the prominent man to be mur dered while the victim is still free could prevent his murder
Not only pre vent the murder but catch the Murder Syndicate right in the commission of his crime But how Vee was puzzled
The letters are never delivered until the next morning
The victims of the extortion dont get them until long after the man is deadand found No they dontbut Uncle Sam does
They are in the United States post office
Thats what went to Washington about
want just one of those letters naming this prominent manbefore he is taken and killed But how BrentwoodJ
Seymour Brentwood
want that letter as soon as it is received in the post office
See Dean
If have the name of the next prominent victim to be nailed up and have it before the crime takes place dont have to go out and find the monster who runs this Mur der Syndicate
can wait until he comes to me wait with the prominent victim He grinned crookedly
Cancan the postal authorities do it Thats what asked myself Brown nodded
But let me tell you
talked to big manhis name would surprise you
He listened lifted his phone talked to several people
Finally he turned to me
He said Youll have your letter Mr Brown
Youll have it five minutes after it is received at any post office
No ifs and buts Dean
straight statement But if the victim is already taken According to Brentwoods letter he would be alive and well
And they couldnt have taken him now
Dont forget this is to be prominent man
If he were missing any length of time the family would be worried his business associates Red Friday and the police would be notified
Its not sure thing
But think the Murder Syndicate will run true to form this time
Its their big knockover
The payoff You have told Mortimer Doran No one no one but you
We wont have any leak this time But the government might Vee grinned
Thats one thing about the federal governmentthey dont have leaks
was assured of that but didnt need to be
You see Dean they were as much interested in this case as am He frowned
Thats the one thing didnt like didnt like at all
Its really oneman job And with nod when would have cut in twoman job for Ill want you of course
Im no good without an audience Dean
But they in sisted on having an operator with me
There was nothing to do about that
Ive met him and you wouldnt ask for better man
DROWN glanced at the clock
Al most one he said and we havent heard from Pal
And the phone rang
There she is
No coincidences eh He lifted the phone and saw his face change
He said Yes then Yes again in low voice
leaned forward listened
It was the same rough voice disguised very unnaturalthe head of the Murder Syndicate
So there you have the picture Mr Brown
The little lady has disappeared
But dont worry about her yet
Really havent time to bother with her nowbut will after tomorrow night
Im afraid you didnt exercise any too good judgment as to her company
Melrose you know was not overcareful about his friends
He may have introduced her to most unde sirable acquaintance Is she alivenow Browns voice was hollow
Oh yes quite alive
Disturbed per haps mentally for she must guess what her curiosity andassociation with you has brought her
But indeed alive
Im not simply going to kill her
It will be interesting
have never experimented with women
wonder if they take it as wellor should say as badlyas men
What did you say And when Brown did not answer Yes am going to nail her up conscious and shrieking for you to find
You killed my men spoiled my plans almost ruined every thingincluding my reputation for pro tecting those who aid me
Now youve brought me out into the open made me work alone
If thats what you want how do you like it
Ill make you pro miseyes promise
You will be the first to see her body nailed there like the others Brown didnt speak
guess he couldnt
And by the way
Dont have police hunt If you do will know and act at once
Shell go up first You intend to go through with the other tomorrow night voice spoke close to my ear knew it was Vees for saw his lips move
But it didnt sound like his voice not bit like it Have ever disappointed my clients
You lost me thousands of dollars Mr Brown
This time will get millions
First our prominent man then our famous actress
Im little ashamed of myself Mr Brown
pride myself on being businessman
Yet this woman But we all have our weakness
bit childish eh
Just hate of you perhaps
Though set myself up as syndicate Im afraid am human after all And Brown broke loose
Human He cursed and threatened
Just beast There was false sort of laugh over the wire
And thought you were cool calculating killer
You knowI hardly believed it with such conceit as yours but think youre in love with the girl Dime Detective Magazii And suddenly If you make one move out of your house one move on the public street Ill put her up at once There was the click of the receiver and Vee dropped into chair
He was on his feet almost at once though calling Pals apartment speaking to the maid
Then he turned to me
Shes not there
Hes got her This as if he hadnt really believed it He took the drink gave him gulped it quickly reached for the second then hurled it into the fireplace
Its some thing that cant be drowned
need the stimulant but need clear head more
was fool
should have dragged her away locked her up put guard over her
And then suddenly turning toward the door grabbing up his coat You can come with me if you want It was no use to argue with him though did remind him of the mans threat if he moved out of the house
Thats because hes afraid might learn something
HesAre you com ing WHAT night
One spot after an other as fast as taxi could take us
Brown had just one thing in mind
He was looking for Johnny Fitzpatrick
He was like man in daze but he didnt make his search pointed
Just in and out of places
Every once in while he telephoned Pals apartment
The last time he came from the booth frowning
She rang up
The maid was sure it was Pal herself
She told the girl not to worry about her that shed be away for day or so
By God someone must have held gun to her head But why have her telephone at all The Murder Syndicate didnt want policehunt started guess
And it wasnt the maids calling the police that he feared but someone from outside calling Pal and the maid saying she didnt know where she was
Oror He grabbed my arm looked wildly at me
Funny DeanIm hunting the city tonight with single purposeto find Fitzpatrick and shoot him to death
Yet cant under stand it for dont believe he did it And perhaps half hour later when we left one of the hot spots Youve let me act like fool
shouldnt be out like this tonight
IIDamn it
Well go and see Irving Small
He knows everything We had been to see Small before He knows nothing about this Murder Syn dicate said
didnt say word to Brown about his tirade that should have kept him home
knew how he felt and wouldnt argue that with him
It was dose to four oclock when we got Irving Small out of bed
Small was the smartest fence in the dty knew more about criminals than any other man and sold his information to Vee Brown
Brown hdd over his head twentyyear stretchwhich he conveniently forgot so long as Small was usefuland also paid generously for what he wanted
Now he backed the little man into corner stared straight into his eyes
Irving he said Ill give you ten thousand dollars for the name and where abouts of the head of the Murder Syn dicate Irving Small spread his hands far apart
Id tell you if could Mr Brown you know that
Most any of the boys would turn him up for thin dime
Hes not of the city not of the rackets
Its oneman show And when Brown just stared at him know how he works but its through different people
He knows the big crooks approaches them over the phone or through others
They dont know who theyre working for until well like that last one the lad found on Staten Island
He uses many aliases
Red Friday No one would work for him knowing Small this is known only to Dean and myself
Miss la Palatin has been snatched by the Murder Syndicate Miss la Palatin
Mr Brown she By God
Then know who did it TRVING SMALL crossed the room locked the door went over and peered at the windows not out them peculiarly at them
You know Brown was eager
He was after the little old man shaking him
Maybe dont know but might guess
For Gods sake Mr Brown
You wont do anything until youre sure Vee set his lips tightly
wont do anything that will get you in trouble Irving Smalls head bobbed up and down
Theres man on the Avenue
crook that was gentlemana racketeer with word he wouldnt breakone of the straightest crooks the city has ever seen
Hes been away for whilesaved up and quit with Repeal
Well hes back
And hes been talking hinting that the Murder Syndicate had great racket and those who wouldnt pay deserved what they got
didnt believe it at first hed been such straight shooter but it came to me pretty straight
Then heard that he was taking Miss la Palatin around Yes Browns face turned milky white
His name You knew him
Youd hardly believe it
He must have lost his money
Hes hes His name
His name Brown shot the words out though he must have known what that name would be
His name said Irving Small is Johnny Fitzpatrick said to Brown You believe it now Yes yes Vee turned toward the door
must believe it now Irving Small followed him
If you see Fitzpatrick you wontwont tell him told you Vee Brown straightened his lips were long thin gash his black eyes burning coals
You dont ned to worry about Fitzpatrick he said slowly
When see him Ill shoot him to death We left the little pawnshops by the side door and went directly back to our apart ment
went to bed but didnt sleep
Twice went down the hall and listened at Browns door
He was pacing back and forth back and forth
CHAPTER EIGHT Red Friday TIHE next day Vee tried to talk up his own spirits
Just few hours Dean and Ill have him force out of him where Pal is being kept You heard him say he wouldnt harm her wouldnt hurt her until he was through with this prominent man He rubbed his hands together put those black eyes on meworried flicker ing eyes that for the first time didnt seem capable of direct look
And then after he had built himself up to almost cer tainty of Pals safety By God Dean
Maybe should start police drive have every cop in the city looking for Johnny Fitzpatrick You said yourself Vee theyd kill her then
Theyd have to to protect them selves But he couldntnot the head of the Murder Syndicate
Hes too busy today must be
Andand He sat down in chair put his head in his hands
Fitz patrickthe others who hold her for him
Theyd shoot her to death strangle her maybe just chloroform her
Dont you see Dean
Dont you understand
dont want her to dielike Stacey walked over to him and put hand on his shoulder
Dime Detective Magazine He jumped to his feet said No word yet from the postal authorities nothing about the letter There couldnt be Vee
Its scarcely noon God He thumped hand to his head
Ill get them Dean
The Murder Syndicate Fitzpatrick anyone who had the least hand in it
Ill devote my life to it
Ill kill each one of them slowly hor ribly He turned on me
Im talking like maniac and you let me rave
Am the Crime Machine that all crooks fear
Well he doesnt fear me
He takes Pal and laughs at me He does fear you Vee
Cant you see that
Thats why he took Palto throw you make you useless when youre most needed
Yes said when he just stared at me
Youll lose your head and Pal will pay for it
Stop He jumped to his feet glared at me
When he spoke again his voice was very calm
Youre right of course
Dead right
Youll have nothing further to complain aboutnor the peo ple servenor Pal He turned and left me going straight to the gunroom
The soundproof doors closed but knew that he was working the thing out of him
That each dull crack of his gun sent mental bullet into the body of the Murder Syndicate
We never left the apartment
Vee had dinner with me
He didnt talk didnt need to
His face was hard and cold his lips tight his eyes burning balls far back in his head
didnt talk either
FTER dinner Brown went out on the terrace and stood looking over the city
It was raw mean misty rain in the air
brought him out his coat
He didnt speak just nodded his head as he threw it over his shoulders
The phone rang as went in
It might be the call Brown was expecting hoping for
lifted the receiverand froze
The voice was the same
It was the head of the Murder Syndicate
He spoke quickly
Vee Brown
You disobeyed orders and went out
Gertrude la Palatin is dead
They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Run out to Staten Island then
Goodbye The phone clicked
looked at the clock
It was exactly fourteen minutes after eight
Should tell Vee
Should IAnd looked at something else
At the figure that stood in the open French doors the coat half around his shoulders his hair matted down on his forehead his black eyes blazing
Well who was it
The postal And moving forward It was the Murder Syndicate He said started then couldnt give him the message
Yes His voice was very low
The same thing Vee
That you couldnt stop him from making good tonight and And PalPal His eyes were fev erishly brightpoints of heated steel in the center
Shes dead
ShesHes done Dean Shes dead said
Then told him gave him the message
had to
There was no excitement after that
He seemed very calm
The government has failed me
The Murder Syndicate has beaten me
Ill have to go out to Staten Island
Theres chance just possible chance thatMy God
She may still be living
Ill get the police out there and Wong said as he followed strange man into the room Brought him through servants entrance as you make sugges tion Mr Vee
Thishe is the right one And from the position of Wongs right hand beneath his white coat knew it would go rather badly whh the stranger if he were not
Ive got thethe document The man hesitated looked at me
Red Friday Youll have to go it alone Brown spoke quickly far back in his throat You can talk to Dean here andyes let me see it This as Wong left
Brown took the already opened letter from the mans hand
The government man was surprised
Youre not going with me thought you wanted to Whats the matter Shes alive Dean Vee cried out as he thrust the letter into my hand
You were right
Hes afraid of me wanted me out of things for tonight far outon Staten Island
Here Let me read it again all of it He snatched the letter
Later got look at it
It was much the same as the others
rather long explanation of how Brentwood must pay the twentyfive thousand which didnt read then and dont consider of much im portance now
But the thing that got me and got Brown was the last of it brutally facetious
There is to be an added attraction to tonights little performance
Besides Alli son Brackenbridge we are also adding the famous actress Gertrude la Palatin to our list The usual courtesy shown the gentler sex will be missing on this occasion
She will meet death directly after the body of Allison Brackenbridge is found
Miss la Palatin has been under the per sonal protection of Detective Vee Brown
The same Vee Brown who announced through the papers that he would take me tonight Friday the Thirteenth
Miss la Palatin will be nailed upa living picture of this detectives conceitand in retalia tion for his former attack on me
TEE BROWN different man now alert eager anxiouswas speaking
His words jumped out
Miss la Palatins life depends on our action tonight He turned to the stranger
We are fortun ate Halley that in this letter the Murder Syndicate does not name the place where the body is to be found
You know this Brackenbridge Dean Only that hes vicepresident of the Third National Bank and Trust Com pany that he has money andI think was divorced and married again The government man Halley said to Vee Ive got orders that its your show Mr Brown
But put smart man on this Brackenbridge
Hell get information at least all thats necessary
Ill just use this phone He did and it was surprising the infor mation his man had obtained in that short time
Halley read it from the telephone notes he had made
Age fiftytwo
This is his second wife
Divorced the firstover woman not the one he married
Has two chil dren by his first wifeboth married
One child by He seemed to skip down the pad
got his address of course
And hes partial to women
Thats well known understand
Hes been blackmailed once or twiceor at least shaken down
But outside of that clubman extremely wealthy dignified and important
The man the big boys have to see when they want to borrow money from the bank Everything but who he voted for at the last election could get that too guess Halley grinned
Now what Since we dont know where hes to be killed or how hes to be lured there wed better go straight to his house and size him up see if hes got the guts to play ball Lets get going Halley agreed
Just one thing more Vee clutched his arm
This is more than plain business with me Halley He tapped the letter
Miss la Palatin
This murderer has her prisoner
It may be hard to force him to tell us where she is
want the oppor tunity to do that before the police come Halley ran hand through his hair looked down at Brown
Its irregular of course
But if were searching the place for clues couldnt be expected to watch you nor the man either Dime Detective Magazine Both men looked at each otherblack eyes and gray ones locked
They didnt speak
After half minute perhaps then hands met
YJFE went out into the drizzle and to the house of Allison Brackenbridge
Well make it Dean Brown told me over and over
Our murderer always runs true to form
As we mounted the stone steps Brown said Now to frighten ten years from mans life He slid quickly into the vestibule and waited for the door to open
The butler was stiff oversized piece of wax work
He raised his eyebrows as if he had seen it done that way in the movies when the three of us pushed our way into the hall
Then he spoke far down in his chest
Brackenbridge is out And to Vee Brown who had said that Brackenbridge was expecting us He certainly must have entirely forgotten the appointment
Hes out every Friday night
Club you know
Practically his only recreation from business
What dub Brown demanded
Im sure wouldnt know that
And if did know it couldnt take the liberty to Who is at home None of the family
At this time of the year they spend their weekends at Damn their weekends And catch ing himself up Its extremely important that we get in touch with Mr Bracken bridgeimportant to him The butler hesitated long time looked us over finally said His secretary Mr Collins happens to be here
Ill tell him if youll give me your names Halley stepped forward but Brown motioned him back shook his head
Never mind the names
Get Mr Collins at once The butler nodded turned slowly about and with measured tread crossed the hall to door at the rear and at the extreme right
Come on Brown motioned to us to follow and to Halley He doesnt lode as if hed talk but dont want him to know were the law Mr Collins stood behind long flat desk with multitude of papers before him
He was very tall and very thin and his shoulders bent forward
His age was perhaps forty
Brown said without preliminaries How long have you been with Mr Brackenbridge Eleven years
The man leaned over the desk his eyebrows raised some what like the butlers
Your question sir might be considered an impertinence and Hell said Brown
Wheres Brack enbridge He snapped out badge pointed at Halley
Hes secretservice man
Ever hear of the Murder Syndi cate Yes
Yes have Then dont monkey around
Weve come here to save Mr Brackenbridges life
Hes the next victimtonights vic tim
Now where is he THE mans face turned sort of green ish yellow his arms seemed to fold up on the desk
He just slid rather than fell into the chair
Not Mr Bracken bridge
It couldnt be Where is he Brown demanded
Hes at his dub
cancan get hold of him there on the phone and tell him Collins reached for the phone
Brown never took his eyes off the man his hand shot oifl shoyed Collins back
Give me the name of the dub
Ill get him Its not exactly club
Itsits Its dame eh Brown nodded and to Halley Of course thats it The Mur der Syndicate discovered he visited woman
From what the butler said its Red Friday every Friday night
Or maybe this time for the weekend Collins tongue came out ran over his lips
He sputtered The scandali Why not let me telephone him and warn him And suddenly My God gentlemen this is terrible
dont know what to do what to say
Hes Just young lady he has grown interested in as if she were his own daughter
His own children being married and Her name
Her address
Is he there now Brown slammed out the words
Miss Claire Vaugne Collins gave us an address further uptown
You think this devil knew about thethe young lady
Why its ghastly
Mr Bracken bridge will be there alone with her alone in that big house No servants No Collins was excited now and didnt choose his words
He forgot that Mr Brackenbridges interest was simply fatherly
No servants on Friday nights
Mr Brackenbridge had anunpleasant ex perience before
Hes careful man
Now Brown was questioning the thor oughly frightened secretary
What type of man was Brackenbridge
Would he play along with them
Would he help set die trap that would catch the Murder Syndicate
Good God Collins gasped
Have Mr Brackenbridge stay there and wait for the murderer to come
The scandal of the thing You think hed rather be nailed to wall eh
No no Collins began to run hands through his hair sort of dance up and down
must call him
He mustnt stay there another minute
dont see how the house was discovered
said Its private house Vee
We might get in hide somewhere and No no He shook his head
That wouldnt do
It depends too much on luck
The stage has to be set
Bracken bridge has to be the featured player TTALLEY said slowly We know where he is and know its love nest
We can walk in catch them togeth er and give Brackenbridge his choice of playing along with the law or facing scandal And the woman Women can be bandied too Gentlemengentlemen The secre tary was ready to blow up
Brack enbridge is big man powerful man has influence
You cant take liberties with him as you would with Halley jerked thumb at the secretary Collins
What about this bird
Hell buzz Brackenbridge as soon as we leave Brown lifted the phone called num ber
heard him talking to Finn big rough excop who now served on the As staff
Thats right he was finishing
You know Dean Condon
Hell meet you right up from the corner with this party
No youre not to do thing to this man just ride him around
Yes you can take him out to the roadhousesanything at all
But dont let him get near phone
You can spend century Brown looked at Collins
Youll need it
He doesnt look like heavy spender We had little trouble of course
You cant do this and You cant do that from Collins
Then he heard Browns name
He fairly gasped
Not the detective who shot all those men andand Big Boy Wallace Thats right Brown twisted his mouth slightly
So you make squawk on the way out and Ill put bullet or two in your back His voice sounded very serious almost solemn yet he wink ed at Halley when Collins turned
We left without even the butler bring aware of our departure
Dime Detective Magazine We had walked down the block and Brown had hailed cab before Collins found his voice
assure you Mr Brown wont mention word of this to anyone wont even telephone Mr Brackenbridge
So you see theres no needreally no need at allof treating me like common felon Its for your own good Brown slapped him on the back as he pushed him into the cab
Look at the story you can tell him if Brackenbridge asks why you didnt phone And to me All right
You deliver him safely to Finn
Halley and cant spare the time But want to must be there And you will
You know the address
Wait around the corner down the block Ill come for you And we were off
No need to go into Collins conversa tion or my anxiety to get him off my hands
We met Finn huge giant of man whose capacity certainly was not all muscular
So you and me are going to make night of it eh Finn took Collins arm as he led him to another car
It wont cost us cent so well drink only the best But neverthat is seldom touch anything Oh no heard Finn say just before returned to my own cab
But you will tonight Mr Collins
You will tonight CHAPTER NINE Behind the Curtains TVHEN reached the comer uptown dismissed the car and waited
Five ten minutes passed nearlfifteen
Had things gone wrong had things broken without me
But it was early yet very early for And jumped
Brown had crossed from the other side of the street and tapped me on the shoulder
We make our entrance from the street behind he told me
Really no need for it
Dean for Im sure the house isnt watchedthat is unless this Murder Syndicate has hired place across the street and watches from the window
Still well stick to that rear entrance He led me down the street and around the corner still talking
And theres no need for him to have the house watched
Its just natural for our murder master
Hes discovered Brackenbridges littleor rather large love nestfor the house is fourstory one
There is no one there but the squeakyvoiced blonde and our eminent banker
Its setup oneman job
By God Dean he could murder both of them and take his time about it
dont think he even thought the secretary was on His shoulders moved as he looked up at house and we ducked quickly into an alley
We cant afford to be seen by the peo ple in the house behind and have the police on us Brown said as we sought particularly dark corner and climbing the fence dropped to the stone yard of the place we sought
Vee asked him what did Brack enbridge say
Hethe girl
They let you in
Was he willing to help the police by waiting and Not so fast Dean
In the first place we werent let in
We came by cellar window He chuckled slightly
He had been feeling and acting himself once more ever since the letter with the news Pal was alive
We entered at most embarrassing moment for Mr Bracken bridge
most compromising situation to put it mildly
Damn it
Dean he thought we were detectives looking for divorce evidence and tried to buy usoff
He was almost relieved when he found we only wanted to prevent his murder Would he help Red Friday He will could see Browns head nod as we reached the back door
When he got thinking and recalling what he had heard about this killer he agreed
His enthusiasm was not great
Ill admit
But you can have look at him yourself
Ive set the stage Brown locked the back door carefully behind him
We passed through the kit chen pantry dining room and so to the living roomand Allison Brackenbridge
He was banker
He couldnt have been more of banker if he had been made up to play the part
Cold steady eyes an extra chin slightly bald and skin as pink and white as babys
And the blond doll
She was just thata blond doll
She kept powdering her face fixing her lips and muttering My Godmy God This is terrible But she cast furtive questioning spec ulative blue eyes at the banker
She was wonderingwas this the end of the sugar
Should she make scene blame him put on an act
But she wasnt sure wasnt going to make any mistake and kept to the safety of My Godmy God
This is terrible TTALLEY said Mr
Brackenbridge is beginning to weaken
hope he does nt mess things up For his own sake hope he doesnt Brown was very grave
Certainly theyd spread his name all over the papers
Hell have to stick it out anyway and if he wont play our game then And turn ing to the banker You know the papers Mr Brackenbridge
Murder Monster Trapped in Bankers Love Nest
Allison Brackenbridge Stop it
Stop it Brackenbridge toyed with the thick black ribbon that dropped down from his glasses
How will my actions prevent such scandal For one thing said Brown Im willing to go to bat for you
You received threats from the Murder Syndicate But never got so much as line had no idea of such thing know
But this is your story now
You didnt wish to alarm your family so said nothing to them but came straight to me
You have been acting under my advice ever since
You say Collins rented this place
Very well the papers cant do much about that
Youve already used the phone and tried to get Collins the butler knows that
It was rather important
Then Collins called you at your club at least you thought it was Collins
He had to see you at once he seemed excited
You came here to his house
Youve met him here beforethings to do with the banktimes you must not be disturbed
And there you are
gun in your back andwith wave of his hand toward Halley and myselfthe rescue squad But it doesnt sound convincing
The papers Collins is not important to the papers and the papers wont take chance on libel suit Yes the girl cut in
What about memy reputation You said Brown will leave im mediately after thethe end of the Mur der Syndicate
You wont be questioned wont even be in it
Ill see to that And after thatwhat She half jerked her head toward the banker
After thatBrown smiled at her imagine penthouse over on Park Avenue
Im sure its more sensibleand safer
There is no reason why things should change between you and Mr Brackenbridge
Of course hell be rather pleased and thankful that youre helping too helping him as well as the police
daresay his reward will be more than generous
He was saying what little wonder you are Oh Ally The girl walked over Dime Detective Magazine curled an arm around the bankers neck
You didnt meannot the ring looked atnot the one from Cartiers
Of course Ill do it for you Yes yes Allison Brackenbridge stretched up his hand and patted the back of hers as if he were tapping desk at board meeting
was thinking some thing like that
But the house should be surrounded by police the man could be arrested before he even got up the steps We went over all that Brown shook his head
We want to be certain
Be sides with the place surroundedso many men men who might talk to the papers about you and Miss Vaugne
But brought in Mr Condon
Best shot in the city Maybe reddened dont know
Brown always kidded me about my shoot ing
But Allison Brackenbridge came to his feet and shook hands with me
So thats settled Brown seemed very confident very sure
Well go through it again then take our places
We cant tell when or how hell come And stage director getting ready to shoot his picture was never more partic ular than Vee
The stage was set
tTHE girl and the banker were to stay alone in the large living room both window shades tightly drawn
There was small door that led to the main hall folding doors with huge heavy drapes that led to the dining room
These doors were open but the curtains tightly drawn
Then there was another set of folding doors that gave onto the front room that overlooked the street These also sported two heavy curtains which Brown drew tightly
There we are Brown explained the whole situation and seemed satisfied
If the trap was natural for this murderer our trap for him is natural too
dont know how hell come but Ive locked the door of the front room which leads to the hall so he wont disturb us
Thats right
Deanwe three will be hiding behind the curtains in the front room
That makes Mr Brackenbridge perfectly safe But suppose Mr Brackenbridge in terrupted he should not come alone
What then Hes got to come alone
Now Mr Brackenbridge you and Miss Vaugne must spend your evening as you would ordinarily spend it
Since Id like you at the table with your back to the curtains so that the man must face usperhaps you might be doing little writing
Miss Vaugne will sit there by the diningroom curtains and read under the lamp Halley said Dont you think little conversation might be better Brown hesitated shook his head
The Murder Syndicate wont know how long theyve been just like that
He cant look in the window
You see he may come right to the front door and ring the bell he may enter by the cellar window as we did
He may even have been here before and had key made
YesI know
Light conversation would be bet ter Halleymuch more natural perhaps
But its too much to ask of them
If our man listened and heard hed find the un natural strained theatrical note in it and be suspicious
No dont think either one of them could put that over Brown took one more look about the room
Brack enbridge sat behind the flat desk
Miss Vaugne dropped rather awkwardly into the chair beneath the lamp and opened book
All right Vee nodded
Now well leave you and watch from behind the curtains looked down at my watch
It was exactly twenty minutes of ten when we pushed the curtains aside and stepped be Red Friday hind them
saw both Halley and Vee reach for their guns and saw Brown grin as clumsily pulled mine from my pocket
Halley took up position right in the center where the curtains parted
Brown hesitated raised hand as if to tap Hal ley on the shoulder then changing his mind went to the end nearer the door that led to the hall
He motioned to me to take the other end
So we were set
Three men
Two of them steady cool used to danger and meeting that danger quickly and with the assurance of long experience
The third man
grinned to myself
Well Id been with Brown and certainly was used to danger even if couldnt meet it with much assurance
THROUGH the comer of that curtain peered into the room
Stiff and straight Allison Brackenbridge sat be hind the desk
Over his shoulder was the mantelpiece
On it was modern electric clock
Occasionally the girl moved the book in her lap crossed her legs kicked one leg against the curtains leading to the dining room
Once when that curtain swayed from her moving foot she jarred up with start put her hand to her mouth sat so on the edge of the chairthen with queer little giggle fell back in the chair
Brackenbridge didnt speak either
He bent over the paper before him making queer designs on it think
But his eyes were ever raising gluing themselves upon the curtains as if he would stare right through their thickness and assure him self that we were still there
Several times straightened Id get sort of stiff
Ten oclock came
Ten min utes after ten
was staring into that roomjust staring and thinking
They were not pleasant thoughts
We were waiting for killer againa monster of murder
The picture was vivid in my head
Staten Islandthe man on the wall
And jarred back
My gun nearly went off
The voice sounded like gigantic roar in the utter stillness of my own horrible thoughts
Allison Brackenbridge had sud denly burst out with Listen Mr Brown
Suppose he starts shooting
He wont Brown snapped out from behind the curtains
Be man Brack enbridge And for the first time no ticed the pallor of the bankers face
Its my family not myself Im think ing of
If anything should happen to me you know
Then the bank
They depend on me for most Silence Brown snapped
And as Brackenbridge opened his mouth as if to speak again Or scandal Brackenbridges lips went tight
He glared at the curtains moment
Then worried look took the place of the glare
He smiled and nodded
It was as if he suddenly realized that his life depended on Brown on us behind the curtains
The silence again
The girl with the book the pages of which she never turned Brackenbridges scratching scrawl upon the paperand the single distant chime of clock
That must be in the hall thought
Halley was still bent in the same posi tion looking between the curtains
Brown was crouched low squatted on his haunches half sitting on his heels
went back to my thoughts again
Twice jerked up my head with start
Things had seemed to get so far away
Brackenbridge seemed blurred indistinct like three men sitting there
rubbed my hand across my eyes smothered yawn and bent forward gluing my eyes to the tiny slit
looked at the girl and the curtains beside her the curtains that led to the dining room
The curtains moved swayed Dime Detective Magazine as they had swayed before swayed as they had swayed when the girl had crossed her legs swayed stiffened froze
The girl had not moved had not crossed her legs
Andand God in heaven
had to hold my breath to keep from crying out
The curtains were part ing
figurea figure that made no soundthat gave no warningwas com ing into the room
The Murder Syndi cate was there in the house with us
There in the room
CHAPTER TEN The Man in the Mask PALL broad all in black
Black hat long black mask covering his face as he stepped between those curtains
The girl raised her eyes leaped to her feet opened her mouthand the mans hand went up and down
There was thudblood on her forehead
saw the red plainly before she sank to the floor
raised my gun shoved the end of it close to the crack then felt hand touch my arm
nearly screamed but didnt
It was Halley
He had squeezed my arm in warning guess
The Murder Syndicate was there
saw the gun in his right hand folded length of heavy cloth in his leftcloth that was the shape and bulk of tool kit from motor car
The masked figure moved quickly so quickly that Brackenbridge had not turned his head before the man had crossed the room and stood beside the desk half facing us half facing Brack enbridge who had swung around
The bankers breath just whistled in his throat
Both his hands grasped the arms of his chair
Allison Brackenbridge The man spoke slowly distinctly and certainly ominously
You who once refused me money will be the example that will make many men pay mepay me when they see you nailed like bat to the wall of this room long pauseand that voice that seemed to ring with disaster
Allison Brackenbridge am the Murder Syndi cate
have come for you The monsters left hand came up above the flat desk jerked forward in sharp sudden motion that was arrested in mid air
saw the bag in the left hand un wind stretch out
heard the rattle of metal upon the desk
Then saw what was there
great quantity of huge spikelike nails and hammer lay on the desk before the bulging eyes of Allison Brackenbridge
The bankers head twisted as if unseen hands moved it
His eyes lowered and he saw the woman unconscious upon the floor
His head swung slowly back and he faced the masked man
Then he looked on the desk again and think for the first time realized what the nails and the hammer meant for he just screamed out the words
For Gods sake
YouBrown He half rose in his chair and pointed straight at the curtains where we crouched
The masked figure moved his gun slightly in his right hand and fired
One shot or two
wasnt sure then
It seemed like single shot yet too loud for just one
Halley beside me jarred back swayed raised his hands and gripped at the cur tains
But just before he fell to the floor dragging the curtains with him knew that two shots had been fired and that Brown had shot the murder monster right in the stomach
Chaos after that
No dont think so
saw the masked man raise his left hand stagger slightly and clutch at his stomach
Then the falling curtains were Red Friday upon my shoulders across my arm over my gun
But could see and what saw didnt help me any
The murderer raised his right hand
Glassy blinking balls glared at me through slits in the mask
He washe was God
He was going to kill me
Another shot came
Orange blue flashed to my right burnt powder was in my nostrils
The murderer jerked back his right arm went into the air his gun ex ploded
bullet tore into the ceiling and now he clutched at his stomach with both hands as he staggered wildly blindly about the room
TT ALLEY lay on the floor
could see the back of his head his right hand stretched out his gun still gripped in it
And saw Brown the curtains hadnt caught him
He was too quick too clever for that
Now he was in the living room talking to the staggering figure
You dont like it eh
Dont like it in the stomach
WellI didnt think you would
Wheres Gertrude la Palatin The staggering figure turned faced Vee bent his head forward peered straight at Brown but didnt seem to see Wheres Gertrude la Palatin Brown asked again
His voice was harder now coldermerciless
The voice of killer
The masked figure whirled in circle to come back facing Vee again
He cried out Youll never see her
Shes dead
Yes shes dead
had premonition to night and telephoned Johnny Fitzpatrick to kill her
Ahl He jerked up his right handfired
And Brown shot him in the center of his chest
knew that for the man clawed at his chest now tore at the vest the shirt beneath it screamed horribly as he crashed bade against the wall
He didnt fall at once
He stood there trying to push himself erect as his knees gave
But he couldnt make it
He sank to his knees toppled forward hung so moment and rolled over on his back
And all the time Halley and the girl lay on the floor and Brackenbridge sat in the chair
He hadnt fainted for his eyes were open just staring glaring blank ness in them
The murder monster groaned and once he screamed in agony God
It hurts it hurts
II Kill me
Kill me He raised his gun as Brown crossed the room
Look out Vee cried but didnt need to
The man couldnt see Brown now or if he could he didnt want to didnt care
He was twisting his gun to ward his own head
Brown kicked the gun from his hand sent it across the room said Wheres Gertrude la Palatin Shes dead
told you shes dead And from pleading to be killed he sud denly cursed
Johnny Fitzpatrick killed herkilled hercut her throat
sent him word
Im glad shes dead
Iwhy dont you kill me Im not going to kill you Brown said
Men die slowly from bullets in the stomachvery slowly and very hor ribly
Wheres Fitzpatrick Brown was standing directly over the other now looking down at the agonized eyes visible through the slits in the mask
Crucifier of Men Vee spoke again and his voice shook slightly wheres Johnny Fitzpatrick Find him Brown said very slowly All right
Heres another
Right in the stomach
Right His gun moved slightly direct ly above that grovelling thing
You cant grabbed at his arm
And he struck me
He turned quickly jerked up his gun and caught me flush on the chin with it
staggered back things Dime Detective Magazine blurred
My knees began to give
But stayed upon my feet
Someone had me by the arms we staggered against the wall together
It was Halley
ST then the man on the floor spoke
Johnny Fitzpatrick killed her and hes waiting for me atI didnt hear the address but did hear the apartment numberFourD Halley said His bullet creased me guess and knocked me cold He ran hand across his head
see Brown got himand the girl is sitting up
What the hell happened to you
Were you hit No no
Things just whirled on me Sure said the government man
know how you feel He walked over and looked at the man on the floor
He was still conscious still moaning
Lets have look at that face of his He dropped to one knee grabbed at the mask and tore it off
Agonized features showed
twisted contorted mouth glaring terrible eyes
Eyes with film over them eyes that might have been blue and certainly were fishlike
Eyes that And bent closer then jerked back
Good God cried
Its Teddy Mel rose YesMelrose The man on the floor gasped out the words
They took my money from me
wanted it back
knew Brackenbridge when had money
He sold me out for note
lousy fifty thousand dollars when was worth mil lions
Millions tell you
wanted them again
II He paused looked at Brown
But shes deadshes dead
At least have vengeance Claire Vaugne was on her feet Brack enbridge was muttering something to himself
Brown was at the telephone
heard him talking to Mortimer Doran
dont know what he said but he turned to Halley
Ive got to go Halley
Theres good fellow
Stay and see the police
Its woman Halleya woman loved
Shes dead and You understand Maybe Halley didnt but he nodded as he knelt by Teddy Melrose
You dont have to report to me Halley said to Vee
You can tell your own story
For crack shot you certainly shot this man to pieces Brown smiled sadly
You think hell live Live Halleys laugh was not meant to be funny
Whyyou blasted every thing out of him
Better get going if you dont want to meet the cops Yes Vee turned to the girl
Come along sister
You did your stuff He half led her from the room
VE were out of the house and well down the block before spoke
Do you want me to run ahead for cab No
said Brown
Johnny Fitzpat rick will be there if Melrose telephoned him
Hell be waiting for the payoff
telephoned Wong earlier hell have the car around this corner
Brown was very calm very quiet as he gave orders to drive the young lady to our apartment and get her in the back way
Dont you worry Claire he told her
Well see that youre paid for that crack on the head
Ill be back to ar range hotel for you until things straighten out But my clothes
forgot themev erything is at that house Collins will attend to that and be well paid for it too
You wouldnt think to look at him that there was romance in his heart Vee smiledthat little twisted smile
It was as if he didnt realize that Pal was dead
Then he turned to me
Are you going with Miss Vaugne or with me Vee turned to him
Will you wantI want to go with you Red Friday He held my arm as the car drove away looked up and down the street
too saw the distant lights of taxi
You know what Im going to do and you want to come with me he asked
What are you going to do put it as question but knew
Im going to kill Johnny Fitzpatrick gulped nodded
All right Veeif you must
wont interfere but Im going with you In the cab he said Pal is dead and the man who murdered her still lives
Even you Dean cant think thats right
Im just killer tonight Vee
Vee had hard work talking
You cant just go to murder
Tonight God
You were really going to shoot Melrose dying there on his back He looked straight at me
caught his flashing black eyes in the glare from the street lights
dont know
Hon estly dont know
But you thought so And suddenly So it was Teddy Mel rose eh
He wanted money
He hated people
And he was right
There has to be first time No wonder he knew everything the police did being so close to Inspector Ramsey was trying to make conversa tion
minute later said You Vee
Did you suspect Melrose To you No
Not in the slightest
To the papers Well wont lie to themthat is not directlybut Ill smile rather knowingly
You can let us out here driver And that last almost casual order sent my heart right into my throat
was going with Vee to kill man
had never seen Brown more quiet more sure of himself
He explained that as we reached the entrance of the walk up apartment found the outside door open and slipped inside
Shes dead Dean
cant alter that
If she were alive might go dashing up those stairs toto my death
But theres no hurry now
Afterward suppose it will get me but nowhe found the bell he sought and pressed his finger against itJohnny Fitzpatrick will be waiting expecting the Murder Syndicate SPHERE was steady click of the snap ping lock on the door
Brown reached out pushed the door open
We stepped into the dimly lit hall
Vee closed the door slowly and carefully behind him and turned toward the stairs
What are you going to do Veeex actly He looked at me long moment there at the foot of the stairs
am going to shoot him to deathexactly His whole attitude was free from any nervous ex citement
You surely wouldnt have it any other way
It cant be called anything but weakness anything but vengeance
But couldnt have him live
Afterward Afterward He said simply will never write music again
Oh thats not the rambling of broken heart not even sacrifice to ambition
Its just fact
Somehow know it And suddenly in hard even voice Come on
You will deaden your feet so it will sound like one manthe one man hes expecting Without another word followed him up the stairs
As we turned on the second flight Brown whispered over his shoulder Well lighted
Well be able to see each other if he comes out into the hall
Itll be an even break there Dean And he laughed
At least there was queer sound down in his throat
was close on his heels when we reached the fourth floor never slowing up in our steady pace never pausing to listenjust going up
We turned suddenly stopped dead
We Dime Detective Magazine were directly before the door the open door of apartment Johnny Fitzpat rick stood framed there in the light
His right hand was at his side and his right hand held heavy revolver
Brown said Raise it if you want to Fitzpatrick
Get inside And as pressed behind Vee and followed Fitz patrick who backed into die apartment
Brown went on Dont drop it Fitz dont drop the gun
That wont save you now
If you want it to be plain murder dont mind The door sprang closed behind us
We were in small living room
Johnny Fitzpatrick was finelooking man well over forty guess graying slightly at the temples
His sharp eyes were gray and held sort of perpetual humor in them
Yes they held it even nowpuzzled perhaps but certainly without fear
What are you doing here
Brown he asked and his voice didnt tremble
Firm hard lips snapped closed after he spokenothing else
Im going to shoot you to ribbons Johnny Browns eyes narrowed his right hand came up
Thats why didnt just IdH you in the hall
Now woman shrieked
small figure dashed from the bedroom was across the room almost in Vees arms before knew the truth spotted the red head that pounded itself against his chest Yes it was Gertrude la PalatinPalalive and welL GTHE explanation came then
Johnny Fitzpatrick stuck cigar in his mouth while he talked
Of course he said thought it was you and not Ramsey or Teddy Melrose who stuck Pal on me
But knew from the beginning it was plant
Ive been out of the city but keep myself informed
guess it hurt me
Brownhurt my pridethat you and the little lady connected me up with the Murder Syndicate
And wanted to get himnot entirely for the money but you see Im getting on now and the past well at night it has habit of going to bed with me
Pal knows all about that
Believe it or not felt like squaring my self with myselfand getting the Mur der Syndicate would do that
So laid my own trap
talked all over my month along the Avenue argued that the head of the Murder Syndicate was great guy and knew his business that could use money and if the boys of today didnt have the stomach for his racketwhy did
Of course never suspected Melrose
And the Murder Syndicate fell for my little monologue got me on the phone and offered me five grand to snatch Pal
played him along took Pal into my confidence on the prom ise she wouldnt squawk to you and worked the snatch But why
Because hed trust me come here for her
And Id put the finger on him
It would have worked too guess
Yes to night he rang me up told me to give her the works leave the body in the apart ment and hed take care of it later Fitz patrick nodded grimly
Id have been here when he came Brown grinned shoved out his hand
Maybe its just as well Johnny that didnt shoot you to death
But theres no reward for you
Ive planned to send that money to Staceys wife in Illinois His lips ourved into that little crooked smile
Itll buy her better husband
He stopped started to hum looked at Pal
Theres song there kida real one
It goes like thisIll buy me better husband Ill purchase another man Chuck Evans and Joe Getts were just couple of smart guystwo of kindwho happened to get caught up in the same brain storm
But when the shooting and shouting died it didnt take either one long to see that smarty vs smarty can end in draw as well as win and blast hell out of anybodys AUTOMATIC ALIBI by Carl Clausen He looked up as the door creaked and reached for his gun
HUCK EVANS was smoking his aftersupper cigarette by the gas log and looking at Flossie his wife through hole in the newspaper which he was ostensibly reading
He had fallen into the habit of observing her surrepti tiously of late in detached sort of fash ion as if she were specimen presented to him for classification
Once upon time Mr Evans had loved her in the possessive way in which men cherish things hard won
Like his other Dime Detective Magazine fitting answer rose to his lips but extralegal activities she represented definite quantity of effort He had taken her from another by the right of conquest
The other man was Joe Getts
Chuck scrutinized Flossie through the hole the paper
She was mending run in silk stocking by the light of the bridge lamp
Her lips were too red her hair too platinum
These were the obvious details
They evoked no thought of cen sure
Chuck liked his women vivid
What irked him was the knowledge that the sudden tender curve of her lips as she bent forward at her task was for Joenot him
Mr Evans was not given to selfanaly sis so he merely wondered what good looking broad like Flossie could see in gorilla like Joe Getts and he smiled mys teriously behind the newspaper as he toyed with the idea of what he meant to do to that simian this night Presently he laid the paper down and glanced at his wristwatch
Guess Ftt be going over to the Dutch mans he said
He had made this re mark threesometimes four and occa sionally fivenights week for the past year hut tonight he injected an extra note of casualness in the statement
The Dutchmans was poolroom where men of his kind congreg ate and dis cussed ways and means
The four flea bitten pool tables were an excuse to per mit the police to collect the license fee
In the rear room one could buy anything from hypodermic needle to gat
Wish youd go up to the storage and get my fur coat Flossie said without raising her eyes from the stocking
Its glaced and all ready
The paper says its going to be cold tomorrow You mean that joint way up on Am sterdam and Ninetyfifth he demanded
All right never mind she retorted
There was once youd have run your self ragged for me thought flashing into secret and hid den chamber of his tortuous mind he kept his peace
He consulted his watch again and com pared it with the clock on the mantel
Unknown to Flossie he had set both ahead half an hourfor purposes of his own
Why dont you phone them and tell em to deliver it he asked
Because tonights Saturday night
They wont make deliveries after eight but theyre open till midnight All right he grumbled Ill get it HE went down on die automatic ele vator Chuck Evans smiled to him self
Amsterdam and Ninetyfifth was way uptown far from where he meant to be earlier in the evening
It would provide him with an additional link in the cleverly constructed chain which was to be his alibi for die evening
Mr Evans never depended upon friends for his alibis
He was essentially the lone wolf type and never delivered him self into the hands of another friend or enemy
His alibi was more subtle one
The man he intended actually to rub out was not Joe Getts but anotherone Man uel Cortez
The setup was as follows Mr Getts had recently essayed to terminate the ex istence of Mr Cortez by spraying him with lead from cruising cabriolet but the body of Mr Cortez own hack had been reinf arced with bulletproof steel for just such an eventuality so Manuel had merely taken to his bed with slight wound in the thigh
Both Mr Getts and Mr Cortez had sworn to get Mr Cortez and Mr Getts as soon as the former was able to be about again and the florists ajacent to Columbus Circle were placing tentative orders with Jersey nurseries in anticipa tion of the event
Automatic Alibi Per se
Chuck Evans had nothing against Manuel Cortez beyond the fact that he did not belong to that branch of the human race known as Nordic of which Mr Evans himself was conspicu ous member
Mr Cortez had merely sin gled himself out for his special attention by being an enemy of Mr Getts and get ting himself in the way of Joe Getts slugs
It was situation for which Mr Evans had waited in his patient way ever since he had verified his suspicions of Flossie and Joe
Technically there was no reason why Chuck Evans and Joe Getts should be on the outs
Each controled his own definite racket and neither had been known to en croach on the other
Ostensibly they were the best of friends
They had even been known now and then to join forces in discreet warehouse robberies when their respective supplies ran short
Once or twice they had appeared in court with as plausible alibis for each other as the legal machinery required
To the world Chuck Evans and Joe Getts were just couple of guys trying to get along in adjoining neighborhoods by observing the rules of the game
All this made excellent stagesetting for what Mr Evans meant to do which was simply to call on Manuel Cortez after dark and finish what Mr Getts had be gun
The police of course would not sus pect him of so fell purpose since there seemed no reason on earth why he should shoot Mr Cortez
And with his customary attention to detail Mr Evans had laid out the evenings activities
Emerging from the apartment house in which he lived he went directly to the Dutchmans
He found present there among others Joe Getts in person as he had known he would
As it was the un written rule at the Dutchmans to check ones gun at the counter before gaining admission to the room at the rear
Mr Evans surrendered his automatic pistol and laid it on the shelf behind the cash register in the small compartment which carried his name
Next to it in compartment similarly marked lay Mr Getts
Both pistols were standard types of the most recent and popular make thirtyeight cal iber and except for their makers num bers alike as pair of identical twins
But Mr Evans knew that to an expert on ballistics the projectiles that issued from them were under powerful magnifying glass as different as is pea from pearl
Therefore when Mr Evans deposited his gun on the shelf he laid it in Mr Getts compartment and placed Joes where his own should have been
It was one of those little slightsofhand for which Mr Evans was justly famous
In the back room immediately there after cards were produced
Chuck played stud with Mr Getts and satellite win ning in the course of time fortytwo dol lars
GETTS was restless
After an hours playing he arose intimating that the game was too slow for him and that he had business elsewhere
Chuck did not inquire where for he knew very well where Joe was going
He had even arranged that Mr Getts should be there
Joe Getts went to the shelf behind the cash register to get his gun
He was about to do what Mr Evans had done switch weaponswhen in picking up his own from from Mr Evans compartment he noted by slight scratch on the butt of it that it had already been done for him
He glanced over his shoulder at the Dutch man but that worthy was deeply im mersed in copy of Candid Confessions
He also winked at his own image in the flyspecked mirror over the Dutchmans head as he replaced the pistol where he Dime Detective Magazine had fotmd it and jacked tip the one Mr Evans had intended he should
As he went out he hummed gay little tune from gay little movie
Immediately he set about throwing monkey wrench into Mr Evans elaborate machinery
Chuck himself left the Dutchmans almost at once
In the holster under his left armjnt was Joes pistol
With his customary caution he had checked on that little matter with the makers num ber
He too was in pleasant jocular mood
Sauntering down the street to the local cinema house he engaged the bru nette cashier in conversation to impress his presence on her mind
After chatting pleasantly with her for some moments Mr Evans bought ticket went within and dropped into seat near one of the fire exits
He had already seen the picture at matinee that afternoon
Now he stayed just long enough to assure himself that the program had not been changed in any essential detail so that he would be able to discourse upon it intel ligently should such be necessary
Then watching his chance he stepped across the aisle when the ushers head was turned and departed quietly leaving very small piece of wood in the crack of the doornot thick enough to cause draft but sufficient to keep the latch from catching and locking the door
The exit opened on an alley and this in turn led into side street Once in this street Mr Evans worked fast
Diving into the nearest subway he boarded an express train and rode down town
The place where he got off has been sung in jwetry and prose shocking place where yellow men they say do unspeak able things in unspeakable ways
Where the elevated roars along street that has been in turn quiet lovers lane stately turnpike an artery of commerce cruis ing ground of sailors on furlough and courtesans on high heels and the theme of ribald song
It is now but sad place of rescue missions with no one to rescue pawnshops when there is little to pawn secondhand stores cheap coffee houses and cheaper cinemas
Why Manuel Cortez chose to live in tins neighborhood had always been mys tery to Chuck
He was making plenty of money
Himself fastidious to the point of felinity he shuddered at the odors that assailed him
He came to this region rarely and then only to confer with one Maurice Klopfel pawnbroker about the marketing of such trinkets as came his way in the routine of business
Passing Mr Klopfels place of busi ness now in the shadows of the opposite side of the street he glanced hurriedly through the grimy windows
Mr Klopfel was not in sight and the door leading into the little room at the rear was dosed sure sign that he was in conference
That the conferee was Joe Getts Mr Evans had not doubtfor he himsdf had seen to it that Mr Getts got tele phone message from
Mr Klopfel anent certain trifle in the way of diamonds set in platinum which could be had for the proverbial song
Mr Getts hobby was baubles at cantata prices
He distributed them among his feminine friends at ran dom and not always wisely
Mr Evans had not the slightest doubt that the trifle in question bracelet was destinedin Mr Getts imaginationto adorn the slender wrist of his Flossie after he himself had been somewhere in terred
TTE could of course have shot Mr Getts forthwith but aside from the risk of arrest and conviction there were other reasons why this was inexpedient
Mr Getts was popular with his mob also he was power in politics in his neighborhood as Mr Evans was in his
Automatic Alibi In these days of investigations and Tammany disfavor one had to forget per sonal desires and work for the common good
The home of Manuel Cortez was threestory walkup
In its palmy days when the Bouwerie was in the stately turnpike stage it had been the abode of gentry
On the left brownstonebuttress of the stoop reclined headless Nubian lion on the right what was left of its twin
Mr Evans reconnoitered for moment to assure himself that the coast was clear
Then he walked softly through the alley inserted jimmy under the sash of the rear window and presently found him self in kitchen smelling strongly of gar lic fried olive oil and wine
The combination made Mr Evans slightly nauseated
He paused dizzily drew out his flashlight and made his way upstairs guided by an overlying motif of iodoform
The odor led him straight to Mr Cortez sick room
That gentle Latin was sitting up in bed read ing Little Caesar by the light of shaded bridge lamp and chewing bettelnut He looked up as the door creaked and reached for his gun but he was too slow
Two spurts of flame stabbed the semi darkness of the room and he shuffled off his coil with the gentlest little shiver
Mr Evans left forthwith
As he de parted by the kitchen window he dropped Joe Getts pistol in bed of chrysanthe mums that by some miracle grew under it
To have left the weapon in the room with the remains of Mr Cortez would have been too crude
Among the flowers it would appear that the assassin had lost it by accident
As he walked quickly to the nearest subway entrance he drew off the old pair of gloves he had been wearing for the occasion and threw them into the gutter
There would be no fingerprints on the gun except Joes
When he got back to the cinema house he paused peering through the crack of the door of the fire exit until the usher was elsewhere
Then he slipped within and slid into the nearest vacant seat
The whole thing had taken less than threequarters of an hour
He saw the program to the end chat ted with the brunette cashier on his way out then took the West Side subway to the fur store in Amsterdam Avenue near Ninetyfifth Street
Here he presented the check for Flos sies coat and with the garment over his arm prepared to board downtown train as quickly as possible
He was in hostile neighborhood and did not care to tarry there without gun
One Limp Moran lived worked and held sway from Colum bus Circle north and west of Central Park
And Mr Moran insisted upon charging his limp to bullet from Mr Evans trusty gat the result of slight misunderstanding
Just as he was about to descend into the subway at Broadway and Ninetysixth Street Officer Cassidy strolled around the comer swinging his nightstick
He glared at Mr Evans
What you doin up here Mr Evans indicated the coat on his arm and explained the circumstances
And you had to pick cleaner in Limp Morans neighborhood
Cat sweat
If theres any shootin on this beat
Ill do it see
Beat it was just going Mr Evans re torted firmly but not too firmly
Foine an kape goin Cassidy ad monished
It irked Mr Evans to be addressed thus by mere flatfoot but being without con cealed means of support he did just that
An express train pulling in he boarded it hastily and dropped into vacant seat
Dime Detective Magazine It was not often that Mr Evans ex amined his microscopic soul but the un qualified success of the evening plus the lucky break of Cassidys showing up and adding his mite to an alibi already over flowing pot him in mellow mood
Per haps he had neglected Flossie bit of late he thought as he stroked the seal fur
She had gone to bed when he got in so he hung the coat over the back of chair
As he did so the mantel dock struck twdve
He glanced at it with smile of approbation then opened the glass door and set it bade half an hour to the correct time and did the same to his wristwatch
TJREAKFAST the next morning he tried to invest with mildly festive mood
The toast was slightly turned as usual but he made no comment
The coffee was not all that could be desired but he drank it without scowl
Flossie looked at him thoughtfully
Her hard blue eyes narrowed with suspicion
Where was you last night die asked casually
Why said Chuck went to the Dutchmans and to the movies and then uptown for your benny Oh yeah
Well you took helluva long time about it Mr Evans smiled
Aint getting jealous are you he asked jocularly
What of she demanded looking him up and downmostly down
Mr Evans blinked
Whats eating you this morning he wanted to know
Moths she snapped
The morning paper being at that mo ment slipped under the door she went and got it
If there was one thing that infuriated Chuck it was the habit she had of stand ing in the middle of the kitchen munching toast and scanning the front page with out comment when he wanted to see who had been rubbed out during the night But this morning he knew who had been so he merely watched Flossies face
He gleaned nothing from her expression so he concluded that Mr Cortez demise had missed the morning editions
When Flossie finally laid the paper down he saw that his surmise had been right
Nary an agate line of Mr Cortez departure from this vale of tears
Chuck spent the rest of the morning helping Flossie with the dishes and being generally in the way
Her caustic com ments merely evoked the gentlest of smiles
He wanted to be on hand when the news of Joe Getts arrest came along
He was just about to go down to the comer to see if the noon editions had come out when the bell rang
He went to the door and answered it
It was Lieu tenant of Detectives Paul Ames and Cap tain Rice of the Homicide Squad
The chief wants to see you Chuck said Captain Rice
Whome said Chuck
What for Something about fur warehouse over in Jersey Rice said
Somebody cleaned it out last night havent been in Joisey for month said Chuck
Besides dont do business on that side of the river Captain Rice nodded
Thats what told the chief but orders are orders
He wants the frau to come along too What for
What would Flossie know
She never mixes in business know
But the chief said to bring her in
Tell her to put her hat and coat All right have it my way said Chuck
The police auto was waiting downstairs
The four got in Lieutenant Ames at the wheel
He was tall bronzed man
He leaned over the steering wheel like hard riding cowboy as the car weaved through the traffic with the siren screaming
Automatic Alibi WITH Chief of Police ONeill was District Attorney McLaughlin
The As steelgray eyes sized Chuck up from under their bushy brows
Flossie had been left in the outer room
Mr Evans smiled at the two men
Whats this about warehouse job in Joisey Chief he asked
You wouldnt frame me would you
The chief pointed to chair and Chuck sat down
Where were you last night Evans he asked
Whome said Chuckhis favorite retort when gaining time was the essence of the argument
Then he reeled off his evenings activitiesslightly censored with the ease and confidence of one who knows he has perfect alibi
What time did you get home Mr Evans thought quickly
The epi sode with Officer Cassidy called for slight modification of the time element Half past eleven he replied with the dignity of conscious virtue
The chief made note on pad
You are sure that you stayed at the movie as long as you say you did he asked
Sure did
Ask the cashier girl
She saw me go in and come out He offered in addition to give the chief resume of the entire plot including the news reel and the Mickey Mouse comedy
But the chief waved it aside
Let me see your rod Evans he said
dont lug no rod Chiefnot any more What did you do with it Mr Evans considered
This was some what of quandary
If they had found the pistol on Mr Getts it would be no time at all before they traced it to him by the makers number
Honesty seemed the best policy at the moment
sold it to Joe Getts he replied glibly
The chief said nothing for some mo ments but he and the district attorney ex changed glances
He scribbled again on the pad then handed the result over his shoulder to Lieutenant Ames who left the room immediately
McLaughlin drummed the desk with his long bony fingers
Lieutenant Ames returned presently and handed the slip of paper back to his superior
The chief scrutinized it at length then he said Cassidy stated that he ran into you at the subway entrance at Ninetysixth and Broadway at ten min utes past eleven
Check said Mr Evans happily
And live at Eighth Avenue and Fortysecond
It was just half past eleven when walked into my flat Chief of Police ONeill glanced at the slip of paper in his hand
There seems to be mistake Evans he remarked softly
Your wife just stated to Lieutenant Ames that she heard the clock strike twelve when you came in Mr Evans drew his breath in sharply
The idea of tampering with time had been merely to confuse Flossie should she be called to answer questions
He had achieved the effect it seemed
She was in bed
She must have been dreaming he replied less happily
Shes all wetf Maybe she is but if she isnt Fm just wondering why youre lying about the last half hour
It doesnt matter one way or the other Chucks lips parted then came together with click of teeth
Is that why you brought me into ask me fool ques tions he demanded angrily
The chief shook his head
Not ex actly Chuck wondered if someone had seen him in Manuel Cortez neighborhood
Stalling for time he said Whats all this about anyway
Am supposed to Dime Detective Magazine have ferried across to Joisey and done that warehouse joball in half an hour So you admit that there is half an hour you cant account for Like hell do
went straight home like told you You probably did but still it wont do Evans What wont do Chuck demanded feeling premonition of disaster
Whats all this toid degree about Its about Limp Moran Evans
He was found in the areaway of his apart ment house with bullet through his head TITR
EVANS jerked back his head as if he had been struck with black jack
What he exclaimed
Well for cry ing out loud
And you think Id be dumb enough to croak him after having had Cassidy spot me there
Be your age Chief Youd already killed him when you ran into Cassidy Evans
He found Limps body in the areaway just twenty minutes after you had gone
At precisely eleventhirty Youre crazy
told you didnt carry no rod no more You haventsince last night Evans the chief agreed
He opened the drawer of his desk took out an automatic and pushed it across the desk to Mr Evans
Recognize it he asked
Chuck drew back
His face screwed itself into forced smile
How would
All rods of that make and caliber look the same
And Im not having any thanks he added rubbing the tips of his fingers on his knees
We wont need your fingerprints on it Evans the chief said kindly
We checked the number
It was sold to you by Maurice Klopfel in the Bowery What of it
told you sold it to Joe Getts So you did said the chief
He con sulted once more the slip of paper which Lieutenant Ames had brought in
Joe says youre liar
He never bought any gun from you in his life
Hes down stairs
Shall we bring him up Mr Evans was beginning to suspect that all was not well
Still he believed that he saw light in the offing
You took the rod off him didnt you
That checks with my story of selling it to him Unfortunately it doesnt said the chief
Joe Getts lost his in Manuel Cor tez flowerbed on the getaway and one of the city garbage men found this rod yours Evansin garbage can on Co lumbus Avenue around the corner from Limp Morans apartment house If he did Joe Getts put it there him self Mr Evans asserted vehemently
And then he asked innocently What would he be doing at Cortezs The chief smiled
forgot you hadnt heardor had you
Manuel Cortez was also bumped off last night
Joe was in the neighborhood at the time of the killing
Klopfel the pawnbroker stated that he was in his place for the better part of an hour hag gling over the price of diamond brace let
We fixed the approximate time of the killing by Cuban Pete
He had just left Cortez to go over to Mott Street for some betelnuts
When he got back Cortez was dead The chief paused briefly then added Both cases look so fishy that we kept them out of the morning papers
dont think Joe put your rod in the garbage can but you and your lawyer are welcome to that theory
Qever of you to plant the wifes coat in Limps territory for an ex cuse if you were seen there but Im afraid it isnt going to do you much good Automatic Alibi Mr Evans drew deep breath
So youre framing me for croaking Limp Mo ran he snarled
Chief ONeills mild blue eyes hard ened
never framed yegg in my life and you know it Evans he said harshly
If you have better storyan alibi that will hold waterIm here to listen Mr Evans swallowed hard
He had one eminently waterproof
but he reflected sadly it was hopping literally from the fryingpan into the fire
Ill say what have to say to my law yer he snapped
The chief shrugged his shoulders
Have it your way He paused
thought maybe youd be willing to talk turkey Evans
You had the time the opportunity and the motive for killing Lamp Moran
You havent chance What you meantoikey Well the district attorney here is will ing to accept plea of seconddegree mur der to save the state lot of money
Joe Getts has already agreed to take the rap for Manuel Cortez
Both of you are en titled to medals of course but were out of medals at the moment TR
EVANS ran his hand across his eyes to brush away the unpleasant vision that kept persisting there the vi sion of Flossie wife of his bosom plant ing her fur coat in Limp Morans do main and of Mr Getts being small enough to take advantage of hisMr
Evanslittle joke in exchanging guns at the Dutchmans
Chief ONeill was still speaking
Its an open and shut case Evans
We extracted the slug from Moran and our ballistic expert states that it came from your gun
Examination disclosed that the gun had been fired recently
The same holds good for Joes rodonly it had been fired twice so we have double proof there so to speak
It may interest you to know Evans that never in all my years as cop has so complete and satisfactory chain of circumstantial evidence been pieced to gether in so short time and to Lieuten ant Ames here belongs the credit
So perfect are the two cases that if it wasnt that you and Joe were pals Id think youd framed each other He pushed typed sheet across the desk to Mr Evans
Sign on the dotted line please he said affably
The two regarded each other across the glasstopped desk in which many hard guy had seen the reflection of his finish
Something resembling wink in the mild blue eyes of the chief brought the faintest flicker of smile to Mr Evans thin lips
with me he said briefly and reached for the pen
In the Next Issue CARDIGAN COMES BACK in FREDERICK NEBELS TOO HOT TO HANDLE Page after thrillpacked page of the kind of smashing action youve come to watch for and expect whenever that big dick from the Cosmos Agency is scheduled to appear
This time he gets himself mixed up in murder mystery that has all the earmarks of accidental deathand would have gone down as such if the killer hadnt forgotten to put on his asbestos gloves when Cardigan stepped in
DIME DETECTIVE MAGAZINE It will be out for on SEPTEMBER th AUGUST st For Gocf sake get that Death On Delivery One by one those corpsefreighted terror trunks had been burst open the bodys limbs in each case frozen stiff yet the death cause obviously asphyxiation
What was the reason for this mad contradiction of clues
Why Detective Oakley asked himself should even the craziest killer gas man to deaththen chill only the victims arms and legs against decay
door open Brixey urged
An Oke Oakley Story by Frederick Davis Author of Death Lights the Candle etc
CHAPTER ONE Falling Star LAY OAKLEY of Secrets In corporated feeling in festive mood and with his two assistants at his sidethe pert redheaded Miss Charmaine Morris and the aristocratic Archibald Brixeymounted to the deck of the Ocean Casino
The gambling ship lay at anchor more than twelve miles off the Southern Cali fornia shorea bit farther than the arm of the law could spanaffording music Dime Detective Magazine drink beauteous women various games of chance in short all the revelry that Oakley craved
Crossing the after deck where couples were dancing to radioed music between selections from the ships orchestra he observed familiar faces
From Long Beach swift launches had brought movie actresses in shimmering gowns paunchy men who were Hollywood studio execu tives and painfully handsome juveniles
Present also were few local worshipers doing obeisance to the God of Chance and the usual allotment of sightseers from Iowa
It was all very garish play ful and intoxicating
Stick close to Oke Cherry Oakley sighed to Charmaine Morris
see cov etous eyes directed at you already
And lets make haste to lose few hardearned dollars on these crooked games By Jove Brixey remarked gazing upon soft faces and slender figures in the moonlight This is quite delightful The breeze fluttered Japanese lanterns on deck ice tinkled in tall glasses cards flipped chips clattered inside the main salon
Glancing at Charmaine Morris bril liant coiffure as he moved toward the nearest table Oakley remarked confident ly Im playing my chances with the red TTHE roulette wheel was whizzing and two bright eyes were watching the bounding ball when the radio music gave way to the reproduced clang of bell
Through the loud speaker an announcers voice spoke quickly We interrupt to give you news flash ladies and gentle men
The dead body of an unidentified man has just been discovered under pe culiar circumstances on Roosevelt High way at Santa Monica Never mind Oakley observed
We came here to get away from business few minutes ago the radio per sisted an express truck driving north collided with sedan traveling sputh wrecking both vehicles
The violence of the impact threw from the truck an old trunk which burst when it struck the road
The body of dead man fell out of it body clad only in underwear bear ing marks that seem to indicate murder
The hands and feet of the corpse appear to have been frozen yet death was pre sumably caused by asphyxiation Oakley curled his arm through Cherrys and said happily Red wins and Im playing it again The announcer continued The trunk was an old one bearing the initials which had been freshly painted over
The driver of the express truck was se verely injured and has been taken to St Vincents Hospital
Therefore full de tails concerning the accident are not avail able
The police have not identified the corpse but they have revealed that the little finger of the left hand was ampu tated years ago and there is an American flag tattooed on the right forearm
Any one recognizing this description is request ed to get in touch immediately with the chief of police of Santa Monica The corpse Brixey observed aloofly is stranger to me
Red has won again Oke Oke has taken sudden fancy to brunette Archie Cherry remarked and this time no doubt hell play the blackthe fickle soandso Oakley said Nonsense but kept looking across the table at the ravishing brunette
All that beauty cpuld give was hers perfectly modeled face an exquisite fig ure grace of movement and the reflec tion of uncommon intelligence in her lus trous eyes
Because it was Oakleys busi ness to know all Hollywood faces he rec ognized her as Claire Kent an actress Death on Delivery of rapidly mounting popularity whose presence in many Stupendous Produc tions bad eased the eyes of multitudinous worshiping males
She appeared at the moment however distinctly uneasy and alarmed
Turning quickly from the table her satin gown glimmering with the move ment of her lithe body she hurried to ward the forward deck
Pale and anx ious she paused framed alluringly against the darkness outside and glanced swift ly at Oakley
As Cherry Morris touched his arm Oakley murmured Ravishing and terrified Red has come up again Oke so let that be lesson to you said Cherry
Oakley was again intent upon the spin ning roulette ball when exquisite per fume came to him and soft hand touched his arm
Oakley please may see youalone He turned to look into the dreadfilled eyes of Claire Kent
Her red lips were parted her expression one of pleading
Oakley promptly bowed
Of Course
On deck the actress whispered
know youre private detective
Itits of the utmost importance
Charmed said Oakley
The enchanting vision vanished
Oak ley waited impatiently for the wheel to cease whirling as Brixey observed Real ly some chaps get all the breaks and Cherry Morris added dryly Were here to get away from business are we Red clicked up again and Oakley pocketed handful of chips smiled and excused him self
He stepped toward the door stopped groaned and gazed balefully at the bulky man who barred his way
You he said
McClane your presence mars an otherwise pleasant seascape DetectiveLieutenant McClane from Los Angeles headquarters chuckled Hello shamus
We seem to turn up at the same places dont we McClane smiled as Oakley stepped past
But that shouldnt get under your skin
Weve worked together on plenty of cases and You mean Oakley cut in dryly Ive cracked cases for you that had you com pletely stumped and you ought to be grateful
Instead you have childish notion that all private detectivesme in particularare crooks in fancy disguise
At this very moment youre itching to throw me into the cooler All right all right have it your own McClane broke off and Oakley paused as he was stepping out on deck for at that moment shrill frightened scream rang out TT CAME from the lanternlighted gloom forwardquick sharp breath less
It raised heads from the gaming tables gave dancers pause it brought the heelbeats of the ships bouncers pound ing through the moonlight
Then it came second time strangled gasp as Oak ley shifted quickly to the promenade
Somewhere forward dull blows sound ed and cloth ripped
Feet scraped and flashing whiteness near the rail vanished downward swiftly
Quick footfalls raced away through the darkness and from be low came smacking splash
Man overboard Oakley looked down on terrified girls face red lips parted in sputter ing cry hair wetly matted
An inky wave blotted her over
McClane shouldering close bellowed Lower boat
Wasting no time on thoughts of boats Oakley stripped out of his white mess jacket heeled off his shoes
Whiteness was flickering again through the black waves as he swung over the raiL He heard Cherrys voice exclaim breathless Dime Detective Magazine ly Okecareful and straightened into long smooth dive
He bobbed up at once reached for slender hand that was sliding out of sight beneath the surface
His pull upon it brought close to him girls figure
He hooked one arm beneath her chin and with the other grabbed for life pre server that plunked down nearby
Tread ing water he drew the girls arms through it and shouted toward the gallery of faces peering down from the rail
Pull her up To the girl he urged Hang onl Youre all right The light now showed him the glisten ing features of Claire Kent
She choked and clung desperately to the white ring
As the rope lifted her her gown cling ing skintight trailed water
Oakley struck out smoothly toward the accom modation ladder as she was lifted over the rail
The deck was in commotion when he trod wet footprints across it
Cherry Morris eyeing him askance kept at one side of him the amazed Brixey at the other
Through the hubbub of voices that of Claire Kent was audible
II lost my balance
Im all right
PleaseIt was just an accident
Thank you so much
Ifell She tugged around her blanket that was brought by steward tried to laugh
man in uniform was issuing crisp orders direct ing that Miss Kent be escorted to state room
She protested breathlessly that she wanted to be taken ashore at once
As she hurried to the rail she flashed another glance at Oakley with eyes that desperately warned silence
The swift launch sped from the Ocean Casino
The huddled blanketwrapped figure of Claire Kent faded into the moonlight
Oakleys last glimpse was of her glistening white face
He pulled an other blanket around him as voice said Step this way sir
Well take care of you Brixey snapped He can jolly well take care of himself think youre right Archie Oakley affirmed
Ive suddenly lost interest in this boat
It will be simpler to dry out at home He heard chuckle and turned to en counter McClanes tobaccostained grin
Always the hero the detective bit
Always the horses neck Oakley re torted
As dry as you are at this mo ment McClane you should be ashamed of yourself Huh McClane said dully
As the second launch bubbled its way swiftly toward the distant California shore Cherry Morris her red hair fluf fing in the sea wind watched Oakley with wry smile
Archibald Brixey adjusted his monocle and looked bewildered
She said she fell he recalled
But But is it exactly Archie said shiv ering
For some reason the young lady was desperately anxious that no one know the truth
She didnt fallshe was thrown overboard Cherry Morris spoke up pertly
Of course she was thrown Archie
It was Oke who fellfor her CHAPTER TWO The Second Trunk YAKLEY punched the bell of modest house in Beverly Hillsmodest as judged by the grandiose standards of the Hollywood film colony impressive by any other
He gazed at the car which stand ing before the entrance was powdered from bumper to bumper with alkali and dust
He glanced at his watch to see that it was shortly past nine Then watched Charmaine Morris powder her patrician nose before he rang
Strange he observed that we Death on Delivery havent heard from Claire Kent since last night Is it darling Cherry asked frostily
He took her squarely by the shoulders
Snap out of it
You know well enough that Oh hell
Quit being so much of woman She said distantly Did mention that Im considering accepting the fiveyear contract Max Sartman offered me last week to play in Stupendous Pictures Are you He leaned over and kissed her
She stepped back looked breathless said Well frankly no Oke said Oakley
The opening door disclosed French maid who escorted them into an amber lighted living room furnished with Span ish antiques
man past middle age hurried from chair to grasp Oakleys hand
He acknowledged the introduction to Cherry Morris with worried glance and blurted Im Sidney Sandwell Mr OakleyFaith Lees father
need your help Im here for just that Oakley an swered coolly taking chair
As Cherry seated herself he consulted his notebook
You returned to Hollywood later than you expected to when you telephoned me long distance night before last from Yuma Sidney Sandwells was an unpleasant pinched face his eyes moved restlessly
Yes yes he answered brushing ner vously at his grayed temples
You re ceived the telegram sent from Phoenix yesterday The one saying your return was de layed
did Ive only just got back Sandwell continued
phoned your office as soon as stepped into this house
Ive been driving from place to place trying to find Faith
Im at my wits end
thought shed run off with Brooks to be mar ried but Perhaps Oakley suggested wed better begin at the beginning Youyou know that Faith Lee my daughter is one of the most popular ac tresses in the studios
Her real name is Fay Sandwell
Her mother died years ago
She has been in pictures since nineteen thirty
Now shes almost at the top
Weve lived here for the last yearFaith and and Doctor Brenner my stepson by an earlier marriage
Day before yesterday Sandwell went on Faith came home from the stu dio early
Shed had slight heart at tack
She stayed in her room resting the remainder of the day
That eve ning when went in to see how she was feelingshe was gone
telephoned the studio and was told she wasnt there
Knowing that she she fancied herself to be in love with Vernon Brooks her director at Stupen dous telephoned his place
learned that Brooks was not at home
He had left the studio but no one knew where he was And you thought thought Sandwell said nervously that Faith and Brooks had suddenly de cided to get married and had run off to gether
Id tried to discourage her from considering Brooks as husband
was firmly convinced she shouldnt marry him
became genuinely alarmed Why dislike that young man
Besides Faiths contract has nonmarriage clause in it and the contract would automatically be broken see immediately telephoned Yuma Ari zonayou know California couples are always rushing there for quick marriages but could get no cooperation
Faith being of age
decided to drive to Yuma
Dime Detective Magazine arrived there after midnight but so far as could learn Faith and Brooks had not appeared
grew frantic
telephoned you then Mr Oakley because was afraidafraid something might have happened to Faith and wanted your help
stopped at every town along the way thinking perhaps they had gone be yond Yuma to avoid publicity
There was no word of them anywhere
wired you from Phoenix explaining that my return would be delayed
Mr Oakleyits possible shes been kidnaped Youve had no demand for ransom No
Ive been away but the servants tell me no word has come Your stepson the Doctor Brenner you mentioned was not here to receive
such word if it came He left the city the same night Faith disappeared
believe he went off for short vacation
dont know
Hes taciturn sort And Vernon Brooks the director is also missing Yes May see Miss Lees room CIDNEY SANDWELL led the way along the hall Oakley and Cherry Morris following briskly
They entered large modemly furnished bedroom completely in order
complete investiga tion showed that none of the girls clothes were missing
Oakley lifted an expensive purse from the dresser unclasped it and found small box containing many small white pills bedded on layer of cotton
These are he observed amyl nitrite pearlsused by victims of angina pectoris to alleviate attacks
Had she others on hand She was never without supply can assure you
Lack of amyl nitrite may mean death to sufferer from angina in case of an attack
If she left here of her own will she must have taken some with her yet cant say that she had oth Oakley opening compact found slip of paper inside it no longer or wider than thumb
On it was written in an unfeminine hand La Hacienda Arrow head
He kept the slip in his fingers shut the case eased his hand into his pocket
Look here he said sternly
If Miss Lee was kidnaped she must have been taken from his house at night If she left of her own accord she went at the same time
She was not alone here
Where is your roomand that of Doctor Bren ner Sidney Sandwell indicated two doors down the hall
Very close you see
Yet heard nothing And Doctor Brenner was gone at the time you discovered your daughters ab sence Yes Oakley entered the room of Doctor Norman Brenner
On bookshelves there were numerous volumes on biology and medicine
look into the adjoining bath room disclosed no shaving kit
Sand well brought Oakley photograph of middleaged cleanshaven studious look ing man
Thats Norman
His suitcase is not here
He packed and went without ex plaining where he was going or how long he would stay
The maid saw him drive away Then it isnt possible that your daugh ter went off somewhere with Doctor Brenner instead of with Vernon Brooks No
There are only two possible ways to explain her absence
She was abducted or she ran off with Brooks to get married But Oakley suggested once she was married to him which probably would have occurred soon after she left Death on Delivery she wouldnt deliberately refrain from getting in touch with youknowing her absence would worry you
Anyhow she wouldnt go off to get married undressed
The remaining possibility abduction seems not quite logical either Oakley pointed out because there has been no demand for ransom
She couldnt very well have been kidnaped from the house without disturbance which you surely would have heard
When we come right down to it we dont know what the devil has happened to Miss Faith Lee Sidney Sandwells eyes widened anx iously
am afraid shes been killedl Oakleys eyebrows arched
What reason would there be for any one killing her
How could she have been attacked here in this houseas she must have been since none of her clothes arc missingwithout either you or Doctor Brenner hearing some alarm Sandwells eyes became whitecircled
II dont know buttheretheres another circumstance Which youve been holding back on me Oakley diagnosed
Unless you tell me everything you know and at once Mr Sandwell will bow myself out of the case No please dont do that
need your help desperately
Ill tell you every thing know about it andhere He removed wallet from his pocket and paper slip from the wallet
He bent over writing desk in the bedroom and scribbled
Quickly he handed Oakley check written to the order of Sidney Sandwell and signed by Fay Sandwell to the amount of one thousand dollars
Sand well had just endorsed it to Clay Oak ley
Is that sufficient as retainer It is providing Come with me Sandwell led the way quickly from the bedroom talking breathlessly as he went
Of course youve seen the morning papers concern ing the accident on the Roosevelt High way in Santa Monica last night
The trunk that burst opencontaining dead mans bodya man still unidentified by the police know about it Oakley said
AND WELL led the way out the rear of the house into spacious flag stoned patio bordered by gardens lighted by the glow from the windows
The trunk was an old one with the initials on it Yes Like Sandwell exclaimed that He indicated trunk sitting near rear door of the house
It was of an old fashioned type worn and scarred by much travel
On each end near the leather handles was splotch of fresh black paint Oakley approached it in surprise
You can see Sandwell declared that the paint has been used to cover the initials but they still show through Oakleys eyes sharpened
Norman Brenner
Have you the keys Perhaps theyre in the store room
havent touched that trunk
found it only little while ago when got back
II dared not unlock it until you came He opened door near the trunk en tered store room filled with odds and ends of surplus house furnishings snatched ring of keys from nail and hurried back as another door opened and the French maid looked out
telephone call she announced for Mr Oakley Get it Cherry Oakley said taking the keys
Its probably Archie He thrust key into the lock as Cherry went into the house
Neither the first nor the second key turned
Sandwell kept talking
This trunk was kept in the store room
None of the ser vants know how or when it was brought Dime Detective Magazine out here
There were two trunks just alike in the store roombut the other one is gone The third key clicked and Oakley rose unfastening the dasps
You believe that the other trunk is the one which figured in the accident last night
Im afraid so Oakley threw up the lid of the trunk
He took breath said Evidently youre right Inside the trunk curled with knees brought up to chin clad only in under wear resting on matting of clothing lay the dead body of man
Good God Sandwell gasped
Thats Brooks Oakley looked grim Youre sure of that Ppositivel Sandwell blurted
Ive seen him many times
Hehes dead
Very dead Oakley agreed and add ed There in the cornerit looks like chauffeurs cap and tunic Archie as you suspected Oke Cherry said
An urgent telephone call has just come from Miss Claire Kent
She wants you at her house immediately Oakley nodded briskly
He took the telephone from Cherry and heard Archi bald Brixeys cultured voice sing over the wire
heard what Cherry told you Oke
Its exactly right
The lovely Miss Kent is shamefully upset Hop into taxi and meet me in front of her home Archie
Cherry is coming to the office to take your place
Im on my way
Oakley pronged the receiver and turned to see Sandwell staring white iy Whatwhat can we do Sandwell blurted
God its frightfulfinding that He broke off
Oakley you cant accept another case now
Ive retained you
Youve got to help me Youll get all my attention you need Oakley answered
take it youre far less concerned with what happened to Vernon Brooks than you are about your daughter
Neverthelesshere He pushed the telephone at Sandwell
The graytempled mans trembling hands awkwardly took it
Call headquarters Headquarters
But Its case for the police Oakley said briskly because murder is involved
Not one murder but twopossibly more
In such matters private detectives step into the background
Lose no time Mr SandwelL You thinkFaith may bedead Just say into that transmitter Police headquarters Oakley ordered
An ele phant named McClane will come tramping in here in no time CHAPTER THREE kAKLEY brought his sleek roadster to stop in front of another stucco house which sat prominently beside winding road in Beverly Hills
He had sent Cherry Morris by taxi to the offices of Secrets Incorporated with instruc tions for getting various information
Now he strode to the iron gate at which the elegant Archibald Brixey was wait ing
In he said
Remembering Miss Kent very clear ly Brixey answered comply with alacrity Oakleys ring at the door brought Japanese manservant who said when he read the investigators ard Miss Kent wait see you He led them along tap estried hallway to door at the rear and knocked
Brixey affixed his monocle in anticipation of the Kentian beauty but there was no answer
The manservant said Maybe she sleep She jolly well didnt sound sleepy Death on Delivery when she talked to me on the phone Brixey observed
She very upset all day the servant informed them
Very indispose
Very nervous
Doctor say she must be qui et
She be quiet now Too quiet Oakley thought
And aloud Open the door The brown hand thrust wide the way
Oakley and Brixey looked in upon love ly boudoir
huge bed satincovered its pastel sheets thrown backempty sat between broad windows one of which was wide open
Beside it lay pair of goldandblack mules
There was no Claire Kent in sight
the Jap suggested tactfully
Oakley nodded that they would wait then indicated the exotic mules
She would have worn those he began if she had left the bed to Glass crashed somewhere close at hand
Oakley spun about Brixeys monocle dropped
The Jap made throaty ex clamation which was drowned in loud er more alarming noise that thumped like brief thunder through the house
Then closely following it scream very like the one that had disturbed the sea air aboard the Ocean Casino the night beforea cry of terror
Oakley sprang through the door with Brixey at his heels
The Jap was run ning back and forth in the hallway hands fluttering helplessly
Oakley peering at other doors heard soft thud and felt the floor jar
He bounded forward once more his hand slipping his automatic from its armpit holster
Outside Another scream cooled his blood as he twisted at the doorknob
He pushed in upon startling sight
This was another bedroom and it had seen swift violence
standard lamp had fallen against French window cracking pane outward the sash was standing open
Beneath it
unconscious lying beneath billowing satin that she had pulled from the bed was Claire Kent
Otherwise Oakleys waving gun cov ered emptiness
He stepped over Miss Kent alertly peered out heard swift steps running through grass
dark move ment indicated that Archibald Brixey was going into action
Someone leaped across patch of garden beyond covered by darkness and Brixey shouted say
Stop Far at one edge of the lawn rustling sounded as the fleeing prowler fled through greenery
Oakley spotted Brixey sprinting in that direction and swerved to cut off the assailants escape
He leaped bushes whirled against stucco wall darted back
Out of the gloom came thump and moan
Somebody had gone down
HTHE hedge rippled as an unseen per son burst through it
Beyond heels gritted on the cement Oakley swung to push through met the obstruction of wall concealed behind the hedge and was forced to go farther along till he came to break
The roar of motor dinned into the quiet as he dived through
car was speeding without lights
Oakley whirled scratched his way back through the hedge saw Brixey un folding unsteadily from the grass and sped toward the house
He legged in through the same window and went into Claire Kents bedroom
The Jap was holding smelling salts be neath her comely nose and she was push ing the bottle away
Oakley took up the telephone and began to dial headquarters
Dont the actress beseeched sudden ly
Dont call the police Oakleys finger poised
Not the police The girls tone was so imploring her eyes so desperate that Oakley abandoned Dime Detective Magazine the phone
He trod back to the hall to find Brixey staggering an through the side door
That young mans aristocratic chin was marred by smear of blood
He Was mopping at it with his handkerchief ruffling his sparse hair and blinking
do wish he complained that we could take one case which wouldnt en tail my getting clipped on the head
That blighter hit me with telephone pole Oakley made disgusted noise and returned to the bedroom
Claire Kent lay clad only in filmy nightgown deli cately adorned with fine lace
She was confusedly gesturing the manservant away
Oakley stepped close draped die blue sheet over her beautiful form and nodded gravely when she said Thank you What happened he asked
was lying here dozing she told him echoing the alarm she had felt at the moment
was awakened by some one seizing me
hand closed over my mouth was pulled out of bed and into the next room
Somehow managed to break awayI think screamed
You did Oakley affirmed and thereby saved yourself from feeing dragged hut of the house
Did you see the face of the man who grabbed you Nomot mice prowler Oakley mused steals in through your bedroom window grabs you attempts to carry you away for the devil only knows what purposeand you de cline to have the polk notified
Why She sat up in alarm
Oaldey above everything elseno publicity
Not the slightest
No matter what has happened no matter what happensmy name has got to be kept out of this
Thats why want to retain you MotionPicture actresses Oakley ob served dont usually shy from pub licity She hesitated
Oakley youve got to understand
have no delusions about myself
Im featured player through sheer good luck
hold my own because of this manufactured beauty that Hollywood has given me
Its all Ive got ail that keeps me working
Butthere are thousands of other girls in Holly wood prettier than am far better ac tresses
One of them could take my place overnight and Id never be missed Oakley warmed to the girls refreshing frankness
At the moment he said gallantly find that difficult to believe Will you help me
she pled
Oakley thought
Ill do everything can to save you from unfavorable pub licity he said but circumstances may make that impossible
You see so far dont know what youre talking about except that you know whose dead body crashed out of die trunk on the Roose velt Highway last night Howhow did you know that She fairly gasped it
How did you Before the announcement came from the radio on the boat you were at ease Oakley told her
The moment you heard it you became terrified
You reoognized the description of the corpse in the trunk QHE nodded settling back again ab sorbed in troubled thought
Day before yesterday was working in thp studio with Faith Lee in When Lovers Part
Faith was taken ill and went home
Vernon Brooks the director filled out the day taking scenes in which Faith did not figure
We finished work early in the evening after dark
We were concerned about Faith so Brooks and decided to go to her house and see how she was
We went in my car
We were almost in front of Faiths heme when the door opened
The thing we saw startled all of us
man came out
He was carying girl in his arms
Death on Delivery She seemed to be otily partly clothed and unconscious
He stepped away quickly into the darkness and because it was all so surprising Anderson stopped our car outside the driveway Yes The man put the girl in car wait ing beside the house
He didnt notice us
Brooks said That was FaithI saw her face Just then the car shot out of the driveway
Anderson said Id bet ter follow that car It went like light ningseveral times we thought wed lost itbut we managed to follow it to building on the campus of the St Vin cent College You took its number
Oakley asked
didnt think of that Brooks did heard him repeat number but cant remember it now
Anderson must have noticed it too but in moment youll understand Its so horrible The girl steadied herself her face white as alabaster and continued
We stopped behind the car on the campus
It was dreadfully dark
Evi dently the man we had followed had car ried Faith inside the building
The win dows were curtained but some light was shining through the blinds
Brooks got out first and said Ill see what the devil this is all about He went to the door and knocked and when it opened he stepped in
We saw him stagger as though hed been hit and then the door closed quick ly
Anderson got out of the car ran to the door and tried to open it but it was locked
He called Mr
Brooks and there wasnt any answer
stayed in the car because was frightened
Anderson threw himself against the door
He did it three timesand the third time it flew open and he stumbled in Yes Oakley said again with mount ing interest
saw Anderson bring up short against long table
He was trying to regain his balance when an arm swung into view just an arm
Anderson was hit on the head by somethingterribly hard
He went down instantly
was terrified think screamed
Next that figure ap peared in the doorjust black silhou ette man with shoulders drawn down his face shaded by hatholding some thing heavy in his hand
He started to ward me And Oakley surmised you tried to get away jumped out of the car and ran
He came after me grabbed me
He struck at me and missed
twisted away and pushed him
He stumbled and fell
He was getting up when rushed back to the car
He was coming after me again when started off
got away from there as fast as couldso terrified hardly knew what was doing And all this time Oakley asked you didnt see this mans face It was pitch dark
All can remem ber was seeing him twice QHE swallowed
rushed off the cam pus in the car thinking only of tele phoning the police
didnt know what had happened
didnt know what the consequences of calling the police would be
realized that if murder had been committed would be involved
But anywayI was going to call the police But you didnt Claire Kent said wretchedly faint ed What
While driving No
felt it comingdizziness
was cold as ice
became afraid would lose control of the car
swung to the curb and stopped the motorand faint ed And then II dont know how long it was be fore came to
Apparently nobody had Dime Detective Magazine seen me
Id fallen over on the seat
was weak and sick
What remembered seemed like nightmare
began to re alize that if murder had been commit ted it would mean frontpage notoriety of the most sensational damaging sort
It was selfish of me admitbut drove home
didnt call the police
couldnt grave error Im afraid Miss Kent Oakley stated
made dreadful mistake but she declared it with admirable fierceness Im glad of it
Above all Im going to keep my career
Ive had to fight every inch of the way upIm going to be star within yearand refuse to throw all that away through sense of duty that might do no one else any good Understandable Oakley sympa thized
Certainly quite human
Go on came here
couldnt sleep
Those were the most nerveracking hours ever spent
Becausejust after got home the telephone rang
took the call in this room
It was mans voice Strange voice
It said Keep quiet
If you talk youll wreck your career The voice was speaking the very thought in my mind
If you talk Ill kill you That voice meant every word
Ill kill you it warned againand then it was gone The man who came here tonight Oakley suggested came perhaps to car ry out that threat
To eliminate the pos sibility of your talking Im sure of it
Im half mad with all this
You can never know how hor rible that night was to me nor the next dayyesterday
grew more and more hfraid as each hour passed because Brooks and Anderson never came back
tried to get my mind off it last tight by going out to the gambling ship
was there when Word came over die radio about the dead man in the trunk Yes
recognized the description im mediately
It was Anderson
That Oakley said suspected It was frightful shock
was ter rified
Seeing you my first thought was to ask your help
went outside after speaking with you because felt faint again
was walking along the deck when sawcoming out of doorway to ward me looking at methe same figure had seen before The man who had Carried Faith Lee from her house the one you had seen in the door of the campus building Yes
There was no mistake no pos sible mistake
recognized that figure standing against the light
knew that he had been following me watching me
must have cried out without knowing it
He came at melike madman
think he was infuriated because Id recognized him because Id raised cry
He grap pled with me threw me over the rail Yet Oakley told her youve called me in and youre telling me the story Theres no other way the actress de clared
And you must save me from the police VAKLEY looked thoughtful
Can you he asked dubiously tell good lie and stick to it no matter what hap pens Ill do anything All right
Heres your story
You left the studio that evening driven by Anderson in your car with Brooks ac companying you
You were tired after hard days work
You had Anderson drive you here
You came into the house and went to bed
Youre vague about the exact time and your maid must be too
The point is you came directly here from the studioyou didnt go to Faith Lees home Death on Delivery Yes Brooks had voiced his concern about Miss Leethis is still your story
You had Anderson drive him to Miss Lees home
Of what happened after that you know absolutely nothing whatever Yes Thats the story youve got to stick to
No matter how many cops bully you thats all you know
Your promise to that is necessary before go further with this matter
promise it
Ill do it In that case Oakley said rising Ill send you my billlater knock sounded upon the door
Brix ey rose opened it and the Japanese ser vant look in
Man see Miss Kent he moilthed
Name McClane
From head quars Oh Lord Oakley moaned
Claire Kent snatched at Oakleys hand
He thrust stem finger toward her shape ly nose
Stick to that story
Start tele phoning headquarters right now to tell them youve just learned that the dead body in die trunk is Andersons
Let Mc Clane interrupt you but dont let him bulldoze you
If you doyoure sunk To the Jap he directed Show that big ox in The anxious girls eyes followed him as he left the bedroom
The manservant was hurrying to the front entrance
Brix ey dabbing at his injured chin followed Oakley to the side door
They slipped out as McClanes heavy heelbeats started up the hallway
Oakley hurried to his roadster and slipped behind the wheel
He started the motor and said Im damned fool CHAPTER FOUR McClane Blunders In rpHE swinging headlamps of Oakleys roadster searched across velvet lawn as he followed the gravel roadway over the campus of St Vincents College
When he braked to stop the gleam dis closed painted words above doorway Biological Research
This is it Oakley said as he got out
The building was isolated from others in which lighted windows shone
Oakley went to the bleak door glanced back and pictured the episode related to him by the charming Claire Kent
About the place there was smell of death
The door as he expected was firmly locked
Oakley turned to the windows
Each was crisscrossed by heavy iron bars set into massive frames
The blinds were drawn
Oakley was half around the building when he paused at another door
The lock on the first entrance had been of formidable flatkey variety recent ly added but this was an ordinary type
Oakleys slender Langled steel pick probed into it and slid bade the bolt
With Brixey at his side he stepped into dark ness tinged with faint animal odor
He flashed his pocket light through sev eral doors and saw chairs and black boards
These were classrooms and of no interest to Oakley
At the end of the corridor he found locked door
Again tumbler mechanism defied him
The lab is protected like vault Nevertheless he tried his pick
It was squeaking in the lock when Brixey said suspiciously smell smoke Oakley straightened
So do Somewhere outside cry sounded
The second time it was intelligibleFire Oakley began to move quickly
Long strides carried him along the corridor as he thrust open swinging doors
He stopped short with red light glar ing in his face
He was looking into classroom which he had passed by on his way to the inner entrance of the research laboratory
Flames were leaping among chairs piled up in the center of the floor
Dime Detective Magi Oiled wood was spreading carpet of fire and varnish was crackling
Oakley sidled out the door through which he had come
On the side of the building opposite his car flaming red was flickering through window
Across the campus dark figures were running
As they legged close the glow disclosed them to be coatless hatless excited students
Dormitory windows were sliding up in the buildings beyond and silhouetted heads were poking out
Oakley slipped past the corner
He was in his car and starting up when Brixey folded down beside him
The tires ground in the gravel as the roadster swerved toward the distant gate
Well hope Oakley observed as he twisted into boulevard that none of the students sighted us and start trailing us
Theyll put that fire out in jiffy
The only damage done is postponement of our burglarious activities
Were com ing back Archie BRIGHT desk lamp gleamed in the inner sanctum of Secrets Incorpor ated
Oakley had driven directly to his office
Now he had before him numer ous reports prepared by the efficient and beguiling Charmaine Morris
As Brixey slumped in an easy chair he jigsawed them together
Faith Lee Report from Dr Emanuel Brose her physicianMiss Lee afflicted with angina pectoris
Disease unusual under middle age and women less vulnerable than men but had it
Like all angina sufferers she faced sudden death at any moment
Hard work in studios endangered her life
Some times used amyl nitrite pearls on set
Report from Stupendous StudioF
being paid weekly on longterm con Report from Second National Bank Bev erly HillsAccount in name of Fay Sand well
Frequent checks for large amounts written to order of Sidney Sandwell
Sidney Sandwell Typical Hollywood father
lived on his daughters income loose and extravagant Genuinely fond and proud of his daughter but apparently his chief interest in her the money she gave him
No life insurance
Her death will leave Sandwell without income hence his anxiety
Left Washington University medical school education uncompleted to marry Elizabeth Brenner widow with son Nor man
Resents stepsons success as scientist Elizabeth Brenner died two years later
Married Ruth Kilgore daughter Fay by her
Mother dead five years
Very poor until Fay got footing in movies
Strong financial reasons Oakley murmured for Sandwefls wanting his daughter to remain safe and prosperous He turned to the next report Dope on cadavers Marks on both corpses identical
Hands and feet of Anderson and Brooks severely frozen
This in our balmy climate In each large vein in the thigh had been opened apparently after death for very little blood flowed
In each needle punc ture unusually large over heart piercing to right auricle but this was not cause of death
In each case blows on head suffi ciently violent to cause unconsciousness but not death
Carbon dioxide content of lungs very high death due to suffocation
Since the thigh veins were opened after death suffocation could not have taken place in side the trunks unless the men were put into trunks suffocated removed operated upon then returned to trunks
This is un likely since in that case men must have been brought to Lee home alive then killed and operations performed there
Indications are that both men were murdered in some strange fashion elsewhere then brought to Lee home and put into trunks
Both deaths occurred night of th exact time uncer tain
Archie asked Oakley of his assis tant see if you can get any response from Doctor Brenners biological labor atory at St Vincent College Brixey took up the telephone as Oak ley unfolded yet another report
Death an Delivery Dope on trunks Both were in store room of Lee home
Servants cannot say when they were brought out hut think it was following dinner on the th
Property of Norman Brenner
At on the th the Coast wise Trucking Company of Los Angeles re ceived telephone call from man who said he was Dr Norman Brenner address that of Lee home
He wished truck to come and pick up two trunks
One was to be driven to National Express Company depot in Santa Barbara
The other was to he taken to freight depot in Hollywood and
shipped collect to San Francisco
The expressmen called at the Lee home next morning
They picked up the trunk which was to go to Santa Barbara
It stayed local express office until truck left on regtdar run that night
Trunk never reached Santa Barbara because of accident on Roosevelt Highway
It was doubtless the murderers intention to go to Santa Bar bara and ship the trunk out of there to confuse tracing it
Accident upset this plan
The other trunk to be taken to Holly wood freight office was not picked up by the express truck
Reason the trunk was not crated
Trunks may be shipped as are by express but are not accepted for freight shipment unless crated
Killer evidently did not know of this regulation
Result trunk containing dead body of Vernon Brooks was left at the Lee home
Brixey put down the telephone
No answer from the lab he asserted
That probably means the fire was put out and nobody went into the lab Oak ley asserted and took up the report on Doctor Brenner
No information available concerning Dr Brenners experiments
His work has been financed with funds donated by the college mid by the CWA Reason for secrecy not explained
Brenner had indicated his intention of go ing away for few days rest but told no one where he was going or when
Accord ing to servants at Lee house left in his own car late on evening of th about Nothing about him in news papers
Police are searching for him quiet ly no public alarm issued
Doctor Brenners flight and contin ued absence said Brixey would seem to indicate guilt We must not forget Oakley remind ed him that we have two purposes in this case
One is to locate Faith Lee
The other is to save Claire Kent from ruinous scandal TROM the outer office came commo idon hat straightened Oakley in his chair
voice rumbled and heavy foot falls crossed the carpet purposefully
The door flung open and on the sill appeared DetectiveLieutenant McClane
Cherry Morris voicing protests was tugging in dignantly at one of his arms striving to keep him out
He ignored her gnawed mi cigar glared ominously at Oakley
Call your redhead off Stop risking your precious life
Cher ry
Oakley commanded
McClane do come in
hope you trip over the rug and break your neck McClane tramped to the desk
Just why he demanded have you your fan cy finger in this murder pie
Talk fast and dont try to kid me asked Oakley
You suspect me of so many things McClane
Some day youll try to jail me for stealing the Mona lisa out of the Louvre Come on McClane snarled
You had good reason for being at Kents place last night
Her story sounds fishy enough to make me sure you cooked it up for her Need you Oakley asked be so un complimentary Listen McClanes cigar shifted threateningly
All yesterday Kents chauffeur was missingbut she says she didnt know it
That smells Hie young lady was ill in bed all yes terday Oakley countered because of the unpremeditated plunge into the Pacific which you witnessed the previous night Dime Detective Magazine McGane
Naturally she didnt use her car naturally she didnt call upon her chauffeur
What could be more reason able than her not knowing about him So shes hired you has she Mc Gane demanded
Her chauffeur gets killed in cockeyed way and she doesnt know anything about itso why does she need private detective To save herself from being trampled on by rhino named McGane Oakley answered
Theres no reason for drag ging her into the case and ruining her career and Im going to see that you let her alone
Theres your answer if you can grasp it McGane heaved closer
Just tell me something shamus
If Anderson the chauffeur drove Brooks from Kents place to Lees house and never showed up againhow come the car he drove is back in Kents garage right now and has been ever since the murder Oakley uttered silent moan
Brixeys monocle dropped and his face flashed pale
How come that McGane demanded
Oakley said quietly How should know You know all right
Kents story doesnt click
If Anderson didnt drive that car back himselfwho did
Ill tell you
Somebody who knows what hap pened to him
Somebody whos holding out and trying to slide from under
Some body whos mixed right into the middle of these killings and trying to play inno centKent Oakley sprang to his feet
McGane he snapped get the hell out of here be fore bounce you out McGane blinked
Im going all right he rumbled
When see you again Oakley Ill have warrant for you
Wisecrack out of that iAKLEY sat down and mopped his face
Brixey replaced his monocle which rapidly fogged with the moisture oozing from his pores
Cherry Morris said with caught breath Oh Oke
You fool The detail of Miss Kents car being in her garage Brixey exclaimed is one you jolly well overlooked Oke Youre telling me Oakley removed from his wallet the slip of paper hed purloined from Faith Lees bedroom
He gazed at it intently and said Cherry youre coming with me
Bring stenographic notebook and plenty of sharp pencils
Archie hold down the fort
Weve got to move fast to keep one jump ahead of McClane or hell collar me Fool Oakley snapped as he slipped behind the wheel of his roadster is cor rect
It wouldnt be so bad if McGane werent dead right The car shot onto the Boulevard and turned swiftly east
Where asked Cherry are we go ing so precipitously Straight said Oakley from the frying pan into the fire no doubt CHAPTER FIVE Challenge of Death VAKLEY drove swiftly through sub urbs
Presently he was sending the car up steep winding road
At the end of an hour he approached neat little town sitting at the edge of sparkling mountain lakeArrowhead
He drew into parking space before an impressive stucco hotel at the edge of the water
With Cherry Morris at his side he strode into the lobby and of the desk clerk he inquired This La Hacienda Yes want to see your register for the last Death on Delivery few days beginning with the night of the tenth
We never the clerk began to pro test but the crisp crinkle of twenty dollar bill in his hand changed his frown to an obliging smile
Oakley stepped behind the desk looked rapidly through an index of registration cards
He lifted one from the Bs read the name of Doctor Norman Brenner and said Ah The blue timestamp on the card he studied closely
Doctor Bren ner he asked arrived here at about twelve thirty on the night of the tenth Yes
Hes been here ever since Yes
Doing what Resting all the time evidently except for few swims in the lake and hike or two around it
Is he in or out at the moment In Were going up Oakley declared unannounced They went up to the sixth floor
Oak ley knocked at door the number of which corresponded with that recorded on the registration card
It was opened by middleaged man with tired face and rumpled hair
He was clad in blue bathrobe and red slippers and regarded them curiously
Doctor Norman Brenner Yes We are coming in said Oakley
They entered the room of the man for whom the Los Angeles police were searching at that very moment
Oakley bolted the door
Doctor Norman Brenner looked amazed then indignant then troubled
What do you want Information Oakley said crisply
Im private detective
Youll be wise to answer my questions
Need add that the case involves murder and youre sus pected What nonsense is this Brenner ex claimed
VAKLEY gestured to Cherry who sat down crossed exquisite legs and poised needlepointed pencil above her stenographers notebook
Oakley sig naled Brenner to chair leaned dose and proffered the small slip of paper on which the name and location of the hotel was written
Ever see that before Yes
Its my writing Cherrys pencil made hieroglyphs in her notebook as the words were uttered
You gave that slip to Faith Lee Yes
Look here
Why the devil are you Dont ask questions Oakley snapped
Answer them
You are on what is com monly called spot
Doctor Brenner
Very shortly bull named McClane is go ing to grab you and youll find it an un pleasant experience
If you want square deal talk nowtell me where can find Faith Lee and why you killed two men named Brooks and Anderson Brenner swallowed
Why dont know what youre talking about Surely Oakley pressed you read the papers
You know of the deaths of Anderson and Brooksthat both bodies were found in trunks bearing your ini tials My trunks
You mean Miss Kents chauffeur and Faiths director
Newspa pers
havent looked at one since came up here Oakley sat back
This he opined is going to be difficult for you as well as for me
tell you frankly IVe got to turn up murderer in hurry in or der to save myself from the very unpleas ant legal consequences of rash act
Im going to do it no matter who gets the chair
Youre going to talk Dime Detective Magazine Talk
Youve startled me so that can hardly think Doctor Brenner ex claimed in dismay
The less thinking and the more re membering you do the better Oakley snapped
Now answer my questions
What time did you leave your home on the night of the tenth Im not sure of the exact time
finished work at the lab drove home had dinner went to my room and lay down
was very tired and unintentionally fell asleep
When awoke packed and left When It was past ten What you are saying Oakley stated is that you were asleep at the time the murders were evidently committed
That must point out is no alibi at alL Its the truth You drove straight here Certainly You took an uncommonly long time about it Im very slow and cautious driver An ordinary driver would have reached here in half the time you took Perhaps but came directly You gave that slip with the address of this hotel on it to Faith Lee before you left Yes late that afternoon Why So she could get in touch with me if necessary Where was she when you left the house In her bedroom suppose You suppose spoke through the door to say good bye but there was no answer and as sumed she was sleeping You didnt telephone an express com pany
You didnt go to your laboratory on the campus of St Vincent College aft er you left the house No AKLEY said firmly Doctor Bren ner Im forced to the conclusion that either youre entirely innocent of what happened or youre lying with amazing facility Im telling the truth You would say so in any case Oak ley went on relentlessly
The big point is this
The man who committed these murders was seen leaving Miss Lees house after dark on the night of the tenth carrying Miss Lee apparently un conscious in his arms
He drove direct ly to your biological laboratory and went Thats impossible Doctor Brenner blurted
Im the only person who has keys to that laboratory There are no others in existence None
always carry them in my vest pocket
Here they are He lifted two flat keys from his vest pocket each duplicate of the other
Oakley took them
These keys were on your person when you lay down after dinner Yes They were still there when you awoke Yes Oakley sighed
shouldnt like to face McClane if were you with story as weak as that
Now listen
want to know the exact nature of your secret ex periments in the biological laboratory My experiments said Doctor Nor man Brenner are devoted to restoring the dead to life Oakley sat up
Cherry Morris pencil paused
They glanced at each other as though doubting the mans sanity
Doctor Brenner merely looked at them
You mean to tell me Oakley asked Death on Delivery him that conservative college and the CWA have advanced funds to you for experiments in resurrecting the dead do Doctor Brenners eyes lighted
It may sound fantastic to you
As matter of fact there is nothing startling about it
have succeeded several times in restoring dead bodies to life Humans Oakley blurted
In my experiments have used dogs cats and rabbits Oakley took breath and said Please explain
am not the only man working on these experiments
You may have read of those conducted by Doctor Robert Cornish who was once mem ber of the staff of the University of Cal ifornias Institute of Experimental Biol ogy
He was conducting his experiments until recently in building on the uni versity campus
The publicity given his work led to his being asked to remove himself
have maintained strict secrecy about my own work in order to proceed unmolested
Hmmmf Doctor Cornish and both use teeter boards for simulating the circulation of blood once the dead heart begins func tioning again
solutionsaturated with oxygen containing the heart stimulant adrenalin and the liver extract heparin and some blood from which the coagu lating substance fibrin has been removed is introduced into the circulatory sys tem through the thigh vein The thigh vein Oakley repeated
Circulation is then restored by rocking the dead body on the teeter board massaging it and blowing into the mouth to stimulate respiration
My experiments Doctor Brenner continued are based on groundwork done by Doctor George Washington Crile of Cleveland thirty years ago and also on experiments conducted at the Mayo Clinic in twentynine
Doctor Al bert Solomon Hyman of the Witkin Foundation for the Study and Preven tion of Heart Disease in Manhattan de veloped another method which adopt edthat of prodding the dead heart into action by electric impulses
In this case resuscitation apparatus called hyma notor is used
hollow goldplated needle is thrust into the right auricle of the heart Oakley swallowed
What And through the bore of the needle an insulated electric wire is inserted to complete the circuit
generator sup plies the current and in six cases out of ten the heart action starts again if it has not been suspended for more than twelve minutes kAKLEY asked pointedly And this method has never been used on hu mans Doctor Cornish said Brenner tried last year to revive man who was dead five hours of heart diseaseusing oxy gen and the teeterboard but no injection and failed
determined not to attempt to resurrect humans until the technique of bringing lower animals back to life is per fected for an excellent reason Which is When blood stops flowing through the brain for even short time chemical change takes place in the brain cells
The animals revived are living in coma as result of this action
Months or years may pass before the mental facili ties are completely restored to normal
human revived after an hour of death might live an idiot or go mad or exist in coma
Until that difficulty can be overcome in some way You have no associates in your ex perminents have had several none now
Ive explained the technique to number of Dime Detective Magazine persons swearing them to secrecy about the work
have personally of course conducted every experiment in the labor atory and have taken care that no one else ever touched my apparatus You have Oakley insisted never attempted to resurrect dead human Never
Yet naturally do not in tend to devote my life to resurrecting dead mongrels
My great aim is to be enabled to bring life back to men and women who have died of hemorrhage shock asphyxiation and heart paralysis
Then the scientists eyes gleamed brilliantly then will have achieved one of the most astounding miracles of modem science Oakley studied the intense gleam in the doctors eyesand shivered
One more question
Doctor Brenner
Did you kill Anderson and Brooks Certainly not Very well then
Did you attempt to restore them to life after they had been killed No Oakley sighed and signaled Cherry Morris to transcribe no more of the con versation
Listen to me Doctor Bren ner
want you to stay herehere in this room from now on
Dont go out
Dont telephone
Have your meals brought up
Watch yourself
And in case youre found here by the policeyou havent seen me
Understand that Yes but Thats all Oakley strode out thrusting into his pocket the keys of Doctor Brenners lab oratory
CHAPTER SIX Trunk Number Three AKLEY stopped his roadster near the biological research laboratory on the campus of St Vincent College
Cherry accompanied him to the big door
The pungent smell of charred wood was in the air but no one was about
After pre cautionary moment of listening Oakley slid key into the lock
White light splashed upon him as an other car drew up behind the roadster
The long Brixey unfolded from it and walked with another man across gritting gravel
That you Oke
started as soon as you phoned got Mr Sandwell and here we are Sidney Sandwell asked anxiously Have you no word from Faith None unfortunately Oakley an swered turning the key
want you here because this is the first real lead weve found pointing to what may have hap pened to her Brixey gasped Where what
Oakley stepped in and thumbed light switch
Gleaming bulbs glared down upon strange apparatus
He noted the teeterboard mentioned by Doctor Bren ner bent glass tubes supported by clamps on standards electrical meters hand bellows attached to cupshaped rubber inhalator like small gasmask
Observe Oakley invited the devices used to bring the dead back to life His continued tour of the laboratory brought him to huge white enameled case in one comer
He opened one door and felt stinging cold flow outcold that bit to the very bones of the hand he in serted into the interior
In racked test tubes inside rested cultures of bacilli and jars containing animal tissues in al cohol
His eyes glinted as he shut the queer refrigerator and went on
door on the opposite side of the lab oratory opened into hallway which con nected with adjoining rooms
Oakley leading the procession discovered two wire cages containing mongrels who gazed about stupidly as if drunk
And observe Oakley said cadavers Death on Delivery returned to life by the magic of science Gazing intently at Sidney Sandwell he asked Have you ever had reason to doubt your stepsons sanity Thatthats most difficult question to answer Would you Oakley pressed con sider him capable of deliberately killing humans in order to provide himself with specimens for his experiments in resur rection Good God Sandwell blurted
You cant suspect him of that Oakley retorted can suspect any one of anything without half trying
asked you that last question because it seems very likely though not certain that Doctor Brenner has done exactly that Killedkilled humans in order to re vive them VAKLEYS eyes glittered
Think about it
For years Doctor Brenner has worked on these secret experiments
He has successfully revived lower ani mals
His technique may be advanced farther than he admits
His great aim has been to perfect it so that in certain cases humans may be revived from death
For his most important experiments he would need human subjects would he not Corpses Oakley continued while Brixey stared and Cherry Morris shud dered not too long dead
Dead in fact only few minutes
Obviously such cadavers are rarely available for scientific experiments
The only solution of the problem of supply is Doctor Brenner must make his own corpses
See the logic of it Oakley went on firmly
Assume that Brenners tech nique is perfected that human subjects are necessary that they must be newly dead
He would reason that if the dead is returned to life immediately killing subject is not murder
If he conducted his ghastly experiment on someone to whom he was dear he cotild enlist that persons promise of secrecy after the res urrection and so escape all legal conse quences You meanFaith Sandwell ejacu lated hoarsely
You think he did that horrible thing to her But say Oke Brixey protested
That leaves out Anderson and Brooks completely Not Oakley answered if they threatened to interrupt the experiment when every moment was precious not if they had to be put out of the way in or der for it to proceed God Sandwell exclaimed again
Those marks on the bodies of Anderson and Brooksthe fact that they were not clothedNorman showed me several times the incisions he made the needle he usedGood heavens the man must be stark mad And in that case Oakley went on grimly Miss Faith Lee Heavy steps gritting in the gravel out side interrupted
Hard knuckles beat the door
The knob rattled and voice howled through Open up Oakley moaned as the fists slammed at the panels again
He said resigned ly Open the door Archie before it bursts into splinters
Its our pal
Lieu tenant McClane Open up McClanes voice bellowed again
know youre in there Oakley Cherry Morris looked terrified as Brix ey drew the latch of the door and was overwhelmed by the lumbering entrance of the big plaindothesman
uniformed squadcar man followed him in
McClane charged at Oakley and ex ploded Howd you get in here Oakley sighed
With keys McClane Whered you get those keys decline to answer Oakley said
On the ground that it might incriminate me Dime Detective Magazine You can keep your trap shut and youre still plenty incriminated
Mc Gane stormed
Only one guy had keys lo this lab and thats Brenner
You got em from him
You know where he is
Thats one more count against you
Oak ley youre under arrest can find no flaw in your logic Mc Gane Oakley retorted
But logic isnt warrant This is McClane flipped folded document be neath Oakleys nose
Cherry Morris low ered herself into chair
Brixey scowled and stepped forward pugnaciously
Oak ley inspected the warrant
Very well he sighed
Im under arrest
Youve got me McClane Ho boomed McClane triumphantly
All right wiseacre
Wheres Brenner That Oakley countered Ill keep to myself while
dont want him swooped down upon by horde of your carnivor ous cops
In the interests of my client must talk with him
Ill send Archie
You will not
All three of you are under arrest
Youre all going to stick with me
How do you like that Not at all Oaldeys eyes grew dan gerously bright Dont get ugly Mc Gane
And dont be fool
You want murderer
Play ball with me and youll get him cCLANE frowned suspiciously
Your word of honor that youll bring Brenner right hereright now
Ill take chance on thathoping you dont keep your promise
Because if you dont well get Brenner anyway and thatll be ane more charge against yon Grimly Oakley took the arm of Sidney Sandwell and drew the man aside
He ipoke softly so that the glaring McClane jould not hear
Youll find Brenner at La Hacienda at Arrowhead
Drive up there as fast as you can go get him and bring him right back Yes said Sandwell
Yes Oakley conducted him to the door
The second car outside spurted away Sand well in it as McGane tugged Oakley back
He demanded the keys of the lab and got them
Oakley gestured him aside went to the telephone in the comer and called long distance
He asked for connection with La Hacienda at Arrowhead
Connect me with Doctor Brenner he requested of the hotel operator
Im sorry sir
Doctor Brenner is no longer here
He checked out little while ago Oakley swallowed
He pushed the phone away peered at McClane and asked If by any chance dont produce Doctor Brenner Itll be just too bad for you shamus
Because weve got all the dope we need on Brennersee
made the president of this college talk
know what the marks on those bodies mean
Which McClane added ominously will make it just that much tougher for you if Bren ner doesnt show up can see that Oakley stepped closer
McClane came here for reason
want proof of the murderer as much as you doin fact far more
Im going to get it
Howl all you damned please but Im going to search this building from top to bottom He morosely signaled Brixey and Cherry Morris to follow went into the connecting hallway to the door opening into the lower room
McClane and the squadcar cop tramped after them as they went down the steps
Oakley searched for light switch
He found one clicked it but no light came
Bulb must be burned out he said
Got torch flashlight in the hand of the patrol man shot beam ahead
Oakley stepped into cementwalled windowless under Death on Delivery ground room
The beam of the torch showed heavy racks loaded with discarded apparatus bundled recordsand single large trunk
Oakley paused peering at the trunk
McGane said Hello and tramped to it
solid thump sounded
McClane looked around curiously
Brixey gestured
It came from up there Cherry Morris added Some body at the door McClane grunted Huh and Oakley trod to the base of the steps
The door he said is closed AKLEY climbed the flight pushed at the door looked startled and pushed again
It was set immovably in its frame
He stooped squinted through the keyhole and saw key being withdrawn
It van ished
Its not only closed he said quietly straightening
Its locked
Somebodys shut us in here McGane tramped up shouldered against the door and paused hearing quick footfalls on the floor beyond
Someone it was evident was moving about the laboratory
McGane beat his fists on the panels and bellowed Let us out
Open this door The answer was silence
They went back down
The torchlight sought out wooden box in one corner disclosing inside it odds and endsan old tirepump pair of pliers hank of in sulated wire and flat tool for removing automobile shoes from wheel rims
That Oakley said might do it McClane thrust the implement toward the man with the torch
Get busy Fisher
Break the bolt on that door
Im going soft grinding sound silenced him
It was coming from above
The torch in Fishers hand swung upward to joists and floorboards
The cutting noise vibrated through the wood
Then in the gleam
light point of metal shone as it pierced
What the hell McGane blurted
bit Oakley said
Hey McGane bellowed upward
Let us out of here
Open that door suspect Oakley said your noise is quite useless Again as he spoke the sharp point spi raled through the wood again the bit pushed through and was withdrawn
Without moments delay the grinding sound came once more
McClanes police positive flashed in the light and raised
Oakleys hand gripped it
Bullets wont drive that roan back to unlock that door he pointed out and they might wipe out the possibility of very necessary confession third time the bit pierced Standing and staring will do us no good Oakley stated
That trunk inter ests me He strode to it
McGane grunted again and shoved him aside
The big detective stooped to pull it away from the wall it was heavy
He snatched thr oreiron from Fishers hand and tackled the closed lock
While metal squeaked under the levered power of McGanes huge muscles the revolving bit again drove through the ceiling at point foot removed from the first row of three holes
Oakley watched McGane as Qierry Morris hand stole into his
Brixey ad justed his monocle
McGane heaved broke the lock and quickly unclasped the fasteners
The lid swung up
The light of the torch probed deep into the trunk
An involuntary gasp came irons Mc Gane
Oakleys eyes narrowed
Gad only in pink slip her bare knees drawn updead obviously deadlay the body of beautiful girl
Too bad Oakley said softly
Lee Dime Defective Magazine CHAPTER SEVEN The White Doom TlTcCLANE snapped erect
By God that clinches it
Right here beneath the lab
Look at those marks on her
cut on the thigh the same as the others
Fisher get at that door
Crack it open For moment there was no sound save the quickened breathing of those around the trunk then Fisher bounded up the stairs with the tireiron
From the door came the sharp creaking of metal as Fisher pried the tool
Notice said Oakley quietly that the Condition of this corpse is not quite the same as the two others
The hands and feet of this girl show no signs of having been frozen What of it McClane demanded
Shes deadmurdered
Brenner killed her
What the double hell is going cm up there The light was now in McClanes hand he swung it toward the ceiling as fast rasping sound echoed in the cellar
The bit had rapidly bored out square pat tern
Now the thin blade of saw was biting from one cluster of holes toward another
McClane blurted Ill get that door open He legged up the steps shouldered Fisher aside and tackled the crack of the door with the sharppointed tod
The edge was scarred and dented but the frame had not budged
Oakley watched the saw cut ting through third side of the square and closed the lid of the trunk
Murder he murmured
In this case perhaps not Oke dont care how many murders have been Committed or who did them Cherry Morris blurted
McClanes got youhes going to take fiendish delight in destroying you Oakley seemed not to hear
Perhaps he repeated thoughtfully not murder crash sounded above
section of flooring less than foot square split downward and fell into the darkness
shoe was visible rapidly withdrawing
Then swiftly something white and solid tumbled through the opening and thumped to the cement below
What the devil is that Brixey ex claimed
McClane lumbered down the steps and stared
His light played upon the block of white
It was colorless as snow white fumes were drifting from it flowing vis cidly over the floor
He ducked away as another block of white spilled down from the opening
Spattering fragments flew from it as it struck
Through the aperture third and fourth block tumbleda fifth sixth
Then quickly the opening in the floor was covered
What in hell is that stuff McClane blurted
Nothing so strange Oakley answered quickly
Archie lift
Make it snappy There came the sound of something heavy being rolled on casters to point di rectly above
It stopped suddenly
Oakley spun Brixey to position be neath the now covered hole
He eeled him self to Brixeys shoulders reached for the linoleum that had been drawn above the hole and pushed hard
It bulged an inch and met heavy obstruction
He dropped breathless snatched the torch from McClanes hand and turned it upon the fuming bricks
Dry ice he said
You mean the stuff thats used to pack ice cream McClane demanded
What the devil was it thrown down here for For the purpose Oakley said of murder
We may now stand back and con template death by suffocationall of us Oke Cherry Morris cried
Death on Delivery This is no time for wise cracks Mc Clane stormed
How can that stuff kill us
And if it can Footfalls were moving rapidly across the floor above
click sounded as if the laboratory lights had been switched out
Then silence
The man up there Oakley said quietly is our murderer TITcCLANE whirled
Keep at that door Fisher
Burst that lock and as the staring squadcar man whirled up the steps Whatre you talking about suffocation
That stuff Dry ice Oakley explained staring at the fuming white blocks is solidified car bon dioxide
Carbon dioxide will not support life
You see it now turning from solid to gas
The gas given off is many times the volume of the solid
Theres enough of that stuff here to fill this en tire cellarand no way of getting either ourselves or it out except possibly Is that straight McClane swallowed
Watch said Oakley
He brought his cigarette lighter from his pocket and flicked it to flame
Then he lowered it to the floor and slowly brought it close to fuming block
The flame blinked out
Breathing that stuff will put us out not quite so quickly but just as effectively Cherry Morris was standing with parted lips watching Oakleys grim face
Mc Clane turned shade paler
You mean to say he blurted that that gas is going to keep coming offthat theres no way to stop itand itll choke us to death Exactly Oakley answered as it choked Anderson and Brooks to death
This room is airtight
Very shortly well begin to suffocateif we dont get out of here McClane peered grimly at the ceiling and pointed his gun
IU get that guy Which wont help us particle
News papers might Oakley suggested
Cloth anything
Look around He snatched the light from McClane and swung the beam upon the shelves found one of the bundles of records to be thickly packed blueprints
He whipped the paper out approached one of the steaming blocks
Dont touch the stuff with bare hands he warned
Its temperature is hundred and nine degrees below zero centigrade
Itll freeze your fingers in flash Thats what happened to the feet and hands of Anderson and Brooks then McClane blurted
But not Oakley aid rising to Miss Lee Protecting his hands by the thick pa per he held one of the fuming white blocks
Quickly he carried it up the steps
Fisher was prying frantically at the solid door sweating mumbling curses
Oak ley shouldered him aside and pressed the white block hard against the door under the knob
The air was thickening
The fuming block in Oakleys papercovered hands was growing perceptibly smaller its cor ners blunting as it dimished
The intense cold bit through the paper into his fingers but he continued to press the block hard against the metal
Get the hell away Oakley McClane snapped
Weve got to break out of here Well never get out of here using that tireiron alone Oakley answered grimly
Perhaps you know McClane but prob ably you dont that intense cold makes metal brittle
When the bolt of the lock gets thoroughly chilledwho can tell
In the meantime everybody stay on the steps
The gas is coming up like water Charmaine Morris was breathing heav ily
Brixey looked anguished
Listening Oakley heard footfalls again through the floor someone was moving about the laboratory
He said Hold that tire iron ready for some quick workbut weve got to wait little longer Dime Detective Magazine Godthat stuff McOane choked
Oakley pressed harder fingers numbed
Our man he said is waiting to make sure no one comes to liberate us before the gas lays us low
He got the stuff from the germculture refrigerator in the lab just as he did when he killed Anderson and Brooks McClane gasped Hurry it up kAKLEY smiled wryly
Does it mean anything to you McClane that no part of Faith Lees body was frozen as the others were by this damnably odd stuff
Does it mean anything to you that there is no blueness on her skin McClane blurted Let me get at that door Trying to break out before the bolt becomes brittle would be waste of time Oakley pointed out dryly
Clustered on the stairs the five breathed laboriously
The atmosphere was taking on heavy deadliness
Foggy white fumes floated higher above the floor mist streamed from the block clamped against the door by Oakleys numbed hands
Those details about Miss Lee Oak leys voice came quietly mean that she was not murdered and that she did not die of asphyxiation Never mind that now She died Oakley persisted of sim ple heart failure
All the facts point to it no clothes missing from her home for instance
An autopsy will prove it
Fol low it through McClane
Theres only one possible explanation You tell me McClane sneered while choke to death Ill tell you Oakley answered levelly while you gamble on the only chance youve got of living
The man who later killed Anderson and Brooks brought faith Lee here in desperate attempt to tesurrect her Brenner sure
Stark crazy and grab bing at chance to experiment Oakley continued imperturbably That man was seen carrying the girl out of Miss Lees home by Anderson and Brooks
They followed him here
He was in the laboratory preparing to resur rect the girl when they interrupted
Pic ture it
man frantically anxious to re store dead girl to life faced with intol erable delay at the hands of men who could not understand what he was doing McClanes chest was heaving heavily but he was listening
Every second was precious
There was no time to argue
The desperate man solved the situation by knocking Brooks and Anderson out
Then free of inter ruptions he made the attempt to resur rect the dead girl
But he failed For Gods sake weve got to get that door open Fisher coughed
In moment
That man had not killed Miss Lee but he realized that re moving and mutilating her body would mean grave consequences
In order to save himself he had to eliminate the two witnesses to his deed
He dragged Ander son and Brooks into the closets tossed chunks of dry ice in with them and closed them in
They were lying on the floor the stuff froze parts of their bodies and suffocated them The door Oke Brixey urged
Oakley persisted grimly
He then found it necessary to dispose of the bod ies
He hid Miss Lee in the trunk down here
There being no other way
he car ried the bodies of Anderson and Brooks to the Lee home and put them in the other trunks
The rest Oakley stepped back with gasp
He dropped the diminished chunk of dry ice and it fell splitting on the cement below
The tireiron He pried its point deep into the crack and bore back
McClane Death on Delivery grabbed his wrists and added poundage to the pull
In the laboratory quick steps sounded
Heels beat across the floor and stopped as the gritting of tires in the gravel outside carried faintly through the chilled door
Again there were footfalls and the click of light switch
Crackl Brittle metal snapped
Oakley heaved out the door
McClane charged past him slammed into the laboratory and pulled out his gun
Oakley came close be hind to see the weapon leveled at the mid dle of frightened pale cowed man of middle ageDoctor Norman Brenner
Got you McClane roared
AKLEY glanced once to see that Cherry Morris was safe and signaled Brixey to the outer door
He ignored McClanes bellow and stepped between the gun and Brenner
told you to stay at Arrowhead II couldnt the scientist protested
When realized my position fully couldnt let myself remain fugitive
Ive come back because Im not afraid of fac ing this charge
Im innocent Tell that McClane growled to the jury
They wont believe it any more than do Oakley turned
When you hear it McClane youll decide that Brenners alibi is one of the weakest you ever heard
Its so absolutely weak believed it im plicitly You what believe the man Oakley insisted
Hes not our murderer He left McClane staring incredulously and circled the room gazing at the floor
Bits of sawdust were sprinkled over it carried by the feet of the man who had cut the hole through the floor
Oakley paused outside closet door listened in tently and turned his back to it
Youre screwy McClane declared
This guy came here and tried to suffo cate us to death and you think maybe he was just having little fun Doctor Brenner faltered II stepped into this laboratory only moment ago
know nothing Aw nuts McClane snarled
Wait McClane Oakley interrupted
Doctor Brenner have question
Would you under any circumstances even if the deceased were very dear to you attempt at the present stage of your experiments to resurrect human being Certainly not the scientist exclaimed
Ive already told you why
The effect on the brain cells Its no good McClane Oakley de clared
He didnt do it Then who did The gentleman who was prevented from leaving this laboratory by Doctor Brenners entrance moment ago Oak ley answered
The gentleman hiding in this closet He whirled snatching at the knob of the door behind him flashing it open
In stantly swift movement came out
The heavy base of Bunsenbumer stand gripped by its upright slashed at Oak leys head
He ducked aside his up thrown arm numbed by the savage blow as dark figure leaped past
Grab him Archie Brixeys long frame dived at the man dashing toward the outer door
His lean arms encircled the mans waist
Oakley spinning again grabbed the burner stand and jerked it out of desperately clenched hand
He clicked hard knuckles to the point of lifted chin
groan sounded and Brixey found himself supporting sagging form
VAKLEY grabbed the captive slung him into chair whipped out an au tomatic and said Weve met Mr Sand well before believe Dime Detective Magazii Sidney Sandwell crouched gripping the chair glaring up at Oakley
So you didnt go after Brenner the investigator asked breathlessly
You were afraid of what we might learn here
Just as you were when you attempted to set fire to the place to destroy evidence and get us away
You stayed and watched you trapped us in the cellar and tried You cant prove that Sandwell gasped
On the contrary Oakley asserted while McClane stared and Brixey blocked the way to the door
Your fingers look burned
Actually theyre frostbitten by the dry ice you heaved down on us
You tracked sawdust from the ice packing into the closet when you hid He grabbed SandwelTs ankle swung the foot upward peeled down the trouser cuffand more bits of fresh sawdust sifted out
McClane said For Gods sake Oak ley Fill out the picture yourselfyoull get confession from him Oakley prom ised
Hell tell you that he saw Faith Lee die of heart attack
Hell tell you he made desperate attempt to revive her made it himself because he knew Doc tor Brenner would refuse to do it
Hed had medical training
Hes already ad mitted to me he saw the technique of resurrection demonstrated to him
Hell tell you he took the keys of this lab out of the doctors pocket while Bren ner was sleeping and later returned them
Hell tell you he marked the corpses of Anderson and Brooks in order to throw suspicion on Brenner
Hell Sandwell snarled wasnt even in town that night
was in YumaI tele phoned you from there
can prove it True Oakley admitted but you left for Yuma immediately after putting the two bodies in the trunks as part of plan to establish an alibi
You used me as tool toward that end
Its no use Sand wellyoure got Defiance flared in Sandwells eyesde fiance already fading before the inevita bility of established guilt
McClane fast ened heavy hands upon him and he winced
Oakley pocketed his automatic
queer thing McClane
Sandwells one dominating purpose at the beginning was quite the opposite of murderit was to bring dead body back to life
Why was he so desperate to do it
Because his living daughter meant big money to him his dead daughter meant poverty
leave him to you McClane blinked amazement
If theres another point still worrying you about Andersons car being in Miss Kents garage McClane Oakley added thats very simple
The murderer used it when he disposed of the bodies left it in the garage where it belonged and re turned to his own
He may deny it but thats the only way it could have hap pened you see because only Anderson and Brooks were witnesses to the episode of the attempted resurrection that night McClane gulped
guess so
That doesnt matter now anyway Smiling Oakley removed from his pocket yellow slip of paper and pushed it into Sandwells hands
That he said is the check you gave me He slipped folded document from McClanes coat pocket tore it to bits tossed them away
That he said is your warrant
McClane bid you good night
Come Cherry
Come Archie McClane gaped as they walked out
Oakley slid behind the wheel of his roadster
Brixey angled down at the far side and meditatively adjusted his mon ocle
Charmaine Morris nestled between them her arm curled through Oakleys
Cherry darling he sighed content edly make note to send Claire Kent bill for five thousand dollars in the morn ing RACE RACKET by Russ Meservey The greyhounds were whimpering in their kennels that afternoon for dog and his handler had died in the gamblers paradise that bordered the Flagler Track
Died fust in time to turn fiftygrand threerace wager into murder bet
ICK SLATES lean Florida tan nedface bore pleasant wistful smile
He placed his hand on the dog in the stall and spoke softly
Well Tinpan you gonna fetch that sharp nose of you first tonight
You gonna win for Mr Jackwall that gambler again The greyhound whimpered nuzzled the cagedoor wire with nose that was hot against Slates scrawny fingers
One of the Flagler Street track attendants came into the dog house with another hound
The dog was barking but the barking stopped became low whimper like Tin Dime Detective Magazine pans as they entered
As the door opened and shut Slate could see Harry Jackwalls well built figure hurrying away
Jackwall had been loitering outside when Slate had entered
Evenin Nick the redcoated attend ant called and put the greyhound in stall
Evenin Joe Slate answered
Say whats makin these hounds whine Joe
They act nervous an scared Youall quit that whimperin
Fly back Joe said to the dog and closed the stall gate locking it
Dont know Nick lest its storm cominup
That whimpers em sometimes He came along the line of stalls toward Slate looking into the cages
Pooches aint all in yet Nick
What time is He stopped three stalls from Nick Slate finished the it with sharply indrawn breath bent down quickly and cried in strangled voice Good God look
Look Nick Slate took two long strides stood crouched staring into the stall
The wist ful smile faded from his lean face
God Joe exclaimed
Hesdead Inside the wall stall jammed into the dogsized cage the twisted body of small man knelt head toward the door as though in prayer
The handle of knife hiltdeep between his narrow shoulders made brown bullseye in drying circle of red staining the faded denim shirt
Slate stopped shaking the door
He growled Who owns the dog thats sup posed to be in this stall Joe Number Seven Joe answered grimly
Fellow named Owen
Hes new owner from St Petersburg Slate got up from his crouched posi tion glanced keenly around the half gloom of the dog house
Charles Owen he said to Joe in low voice
saw his name on the board
Never raced at Miami before that know of but his hounds supposed to have record in the quarter mile
Fu Manchus the pups name Slate spoke as though reciting lesson he had learned but his eyes kept darting up and down the length of the building
TTHE dog stalls lined both sides of the house in two tiers
The dead man was in lower stall
The steel mesh over the door frames covered an area about two feet high and one foot wide and was too closely woven to permit hand being reached inside
The rest of the stalls were of solid wood with an automatic spring lock on each door
Get this Charley Owen Nick di rected tersely
And Richardson the track manager
Bring em here and cop too but dont talk to anybody else Joe
The first race starts in about fifty minutes an thisll have to be cleaned up before then or th dogs wont run
Tell Sam Wren to keep people out of here
Hold the pups outside
Nick Joe agreed quickly
The Flagler Street track detective studied the floor of the dog house near the death stall
There were no bloodstains
Either the dead man had been hit on the head and stabbed to death after he had been jammed into the dog stall or he had been murdered somewhere outside and carried in
There was no telling until his identity was discovered
Slate had no key to the locked stall
The greyhounds in the other stalls con tinued their whimpering
dog barked outside
Slate stood with his back against the door of Stall leaned there blocking view of the grisly sight behind him watching the entrance to the kennels
Another redcoated handler came in with white hound and behind him short fat man with reddish round face entered puffing
Joe says you wanted to see Mr Owen Nick the handler called
Ive got to park this pooch in here for the first race Race Racket Im Charley Owen the short fat man stated
Hows my dog He eyed Slate as he advanced
Youre not handler are you
guess you must be an owner
know dogs mister
Ive got fifteen of the fastest racers in Florida
Wait until you see my Fu Manchu run Im Nick Slate Slate said curtly
Track detective He made no move to move away from in front of Stall
Did you bring your dog in here yourself or did somebody else Hell no Owen scoffed with wide grin
Im no smalltimer
Ive got fifteen pooches Im telling you He looked around called Hey you
Wheren hells Ribs gone now
Damn it told him not to leave Fu alone
Not for minute
Slate asked Ever hear hounds whim per like these dogs are now Mr Owen dont worry about other peoples dogs the fat man said
He came close to Slate
Get away from that kennel door feller
Youre shutting air out from my racer
know some of those tricks myself
You cant fool me
And you dont hear Fu whimpering Nooo Slate agreed softly and step ped away from the stall door
Owen took keys from his pocket squat ted key poised in front of the lock of Stall
He said Now Fu with throaty chuckle
Now and went sud denly to his knees began swearing
All right Slate ordered
Unlock the door and well both see how dead he is Pivoting on his knees the fat man cried Youkilled him
By God
You His right hand dove into his hip pocket jerked out holding stubby automatic
You killed Ribs you Nick Slate kicked his right foot out and up
The toe of his shot hit Owens right wrist
The revolver exploded once
Its blast sounded like cannon
LATE took four steps along the stalls picked up the gun he had kicked out of Owens hand
He came back stood over the fat man
Youll scare hell out of the hounds Owen and get yourself in jam shooting guns off around here Owen got to his feet He was trem bling
His fat lips moved but for minute no words came from his mouth
His eyes were narrowed showing only brown irises and black pupils
Fingering the gun Slate said irritably Well you didnt use knife on me but it was knife that He ripped the keys from Owens left hand stooped unlocked the stall door swung it open
Reaching inside he touched the body felt cold bare slim forearm moved cold finger of thin hand not yet stiffened
He started to drag at the arm stopped backed away from the stall
Have to leave him in there until the cops move him he said
You called him Ribs
What was his name Jeff Ribbon Owen answered with an effort
Hes my trainer He was your trainer
Ribbon eh
Funny name The whining of the greyhounds kept up
The door at the end of the kennel opened
bulky policeman came in fol lowed by Joe and tall handsome man in light gray suit
IIm sorry lost my temper Owen said
It was shock Slate pocketed the stubby automatic and waited while the cop and Joe and Richard son the track manager walked up to them
He motioned into the dog stall said nothing
His eyes were on Richardson
The cop whistled as he bent down and looked inside the stall
When he stood up again his jaw was jutting
Call homicide at headquarters he ordered the attendant
And tell them to call the medical examiner
Ill have to stay here until they come He got out notebook Dime Detective Magazine began asking questions writing out his report
Joe went outside to phone
Joe and found him like you see him Slate explained grimly
Owen here might know something about it
figured youd want to know about it before it leaked out on the track Mister Richard son Richardson said Thats right sourly
Your trainer Owen Owen nodded started to speak but shut up as the cop glared at him
The policeman said Well hell
This aint going to be so swell for the track guess but it dont have to be made public yet What you think was the idea To keep my hounds from running Owen flared suddenly
Thats the idea if you want to know
By God
Wheres Fu Manchu
Wheres my greyhound was sort of waiting for you to get excited about that Slate said with slow drawl that veiled quickened interest
Yeah Owen retorted angrily again
You seem to know hell of lot about this yourself Guess youre right Owen Slate an swered
Guess aim to Youd better watch your step
Slate Richardson said
This is murder
Re member that
The homicide squad will handle it imagine without your help
You stick to watching out for pick pockets The cop eyed the three of them made another note in his book said nothing
Joe the attendant came back into the building
Homicidell be right over he announced
Id better get the dogs out of here before then Youd better leave Mr Owens Fu Manchu where you find him Joe Nick Slate suggested mildly
Youll find him in one of the stalls He walked along the double tier of ken nels blinking small flashlight into each one
Fu Manchu was stretched out in Stall dead from blow on the head
Owen followed him began cursing again at the sight
Richardson and the policeman stood back by the body of Rib bon
Joe was collecting muzzles and leashes from rack in one end of the building
How much was being bet on this dog Slate asked Owen
You dont have to tell me
dont have to tell about the gun took from you Owen hesitated stopped swearing eyed Slate speculatively
Well Slate asked
Fifty grand Owen said
pool in St Petersburg
Ten of us Nick Slate nodded slowly
His eyes seemed heavylidded
And now that your pooch wont run again he asked
We lose fifty grand Owen muttered
No scratches allowed in that bet
Thats why had Ribs stay with the dog all the You said you had fifteen dogs Slate reminded him
Why not run one of them now Charley Owen stepped close to Slate tapped him on the chest with pudgy forefinger
Thats part of the bet he said sourly
can switch any racer own for Fu and so can Jackwall and his crowd switch Jackwall dog for Tin pan
But the hell of it is Ive got noth ing absolutely nothing mister in the quarter mile heat thatll touch this Tinpan
Fu Manchu could and did take him
But havent got Fu now Slate lifted his shoulders and said Maybe you havent got fifty grand any more either
Id keep that bet secret while CK SLATES lanky figure idled un ostentatiously near the entrance to the entrance to the Flagler Track club house
Down along the stands and under them where the public made their bets milling crowd swarmed worming their way up to the betting booths and back again
But in the club house there was sense of quietness of sureness
It was here that the bigmoney bets were laidbets not on the board bets between owners and backers and dog fanciers
Back further along the stands where darkness was intensified under and around the lights near the dog house the homi cide squad was on the job
Owen had been questioned and allowed to go com paratively free about the track grounds
The dog handlers were being grilled for what little information they might have which was none at all
The murderer had entered the kennel done his grisly task and walked out again
So far as the police knew the killer might have been Joe or one of the other attendants or even Nick Slate himself
motive was lacking
Nobody had mentioned Jackwall being around
Slate watched the clubhouse windows until he was sure he recognized the stocky solid figure of Harry Jackwall inside the building
He ambled on up the steps went inside stood moment until Jackwall was alone
He called the gambler by name grinned wistfully at him
thought maybe Mr Jackwall Slate said that Id find chap named Charley Owen up here somewhere
He mentioned knowing you Hiya Slate Jackwall exclaimed jovially
Sure he knows me
just heard about little trouble or some thing down at the kennels
You should know something about that eh Homicide squads down there now Slate said in his drawling voice
Owens trainer got himself killed and his pooch Fu Manchu too
Most anybody working back there could have done the job guess or anybody racing dog tonight here could have gotten into the kennels
Ive got hunch the police wont work it out right Jackwalls joviality left him
Sternness sharpness came on his face like mask
He studied Slate long moment and asked You think should go down there and talk to the law
Slate Nick Slate shook his head
Thought might save you the walk Mr Jackwall
know Owen hasnt mentioned this to the cops yet and think he wontnot until he sees you anyhow
What Im sort of wondering is you goin to call off that fiftygrand bet with him Ahhh Jackwells breath came from between clamped teeth
No By God no It was fair bet
He took the same chances took
He won the first race
Suppose it had been Tinpan killed in stead of his Fu Manchu
Would renig
Would squawk Well guess you wouldnt squawk Slate said
guess maybe this Charley Owen wont squawk either
But its lot of dough He walked away ambled back outside the chib house
The first race was already starting with Fu Manchus name replaced on the board by dog called Ringo
The betting public was crowding the lower rail down in front of the stand and above the stand itself was almost filled
Slate idled over nearer the rail saw the swishing streak of the rabbit on the track as it went around the course to pick up the dogs
He stood watching until the greyhounds were sprung from their cages noted that Tinpan got away first held the lead easily
Slate had missed that race in the afternoon
Slate was less than halfway back to ward the dog house when the winner was named on the electric board on the judges standTinpan
voice over the public address system announced new track record
The band in the grandstand began to play
Dime Detective Magazine ROUND the comer of the kennels Joe the redcoated assistant ap peared with homicide detective
An other dog handler had taken his place while the police quizzed him again
He appeared calm as though he enjoyed the procedure the attention
Not getting much of anywhere Slate the detective from headquarters called quietly
Guess Ill have to talk with Owen again
Quicktempered bird that Owen guess he dont know much about it Slate answered
He went into the kennel building walked the length of it came back down along the stalls again
He paid no atten tion to the stall where the body of Owens dog handler had been found
Two cops lounged against the double tiers nodded to him curtly
He paused at the stall where he had found Fu Manchu dead
The lock on the stall door was as he had discovered it smashed
He examined it more carefully made sure it had been shattered in an attempt to shut the door not to get it open
The markings on the wood showed that
Outside the dogs from the first race were being led back by the reduniformed attendants but they were not being taken to the kennel
They were being turned over to their owners or owners trainers at side entrance to the track
Slate stood stock still suddenly in the shadow of the building
Two things came to him simultaneously the first thought the second tougher realization
The thought was that whoever had killed Jeff Ribbon had killed the dog Fu Manchu first and had been caught in the act and been obliged to kill Ribbon to cover up his identity
The way that stalldoor lock was broken proved that
The tougher realization was that some body was tailing him now
It was more than vague sense of being followed
It was real feeling
The inclination urging him to turn ab ruptly and face the farther gloomy wall of the track was overwhelming
He turned ducked heard the whish of an ob ject fly past his crouched shoulders saw the faint gleam of steel blade
Then the knife tucked its sharpness into the earth forty feet away near the rear wall of the kennel Slate shoved himself upright strode rapidly toward the rear fence
The bark ing yipping of greyhounds greeted him
Ten redcoated handlers and ten dogs were coming toward him from gate in the fence
There was nobody else in sight
It was impossible that one of the handlers could have thrown that knife without be ing detected by some of the others
As he turned he saw Jack wall moving off out of darkness into light toward the stands
Jackwall might have come from anywhere might have thrown the knife himself
Slate prowled until he found the knife after the handlers and dogs had passed
He saw it was little different from the knife that had killed Ribbonan ordinary fish knife longbladed sharp with jack knife handle
There were hundreds of such knives to be had on Miami Beach
He started back toward the grandstand saw Richardson the track manager walk ing ahead of him
Richardson saw him over his shouder waited for him
The managers face was grave his eyes darkly angry
You found out something Slate Richardson demanded
Something Slate admitted
Not much
found out the dog was killed first and Owens trainer afterwards Anything else Richardson insisted
saw Jackwall and he said you were talldng with himabout bet Thats right Slate agreed
About Race Racket bet
Fifty grands lot of dough to bet on two dogs in three races
Yup found that out too
And found fish knife somebody heaved at me
It wont prove anything except that some people heave fish knives at meand miss Listen Richardson said earnestly
Take this tip
Jackwall thinks you know too much
You watch Jackwall Slate
Watch himl Richardson turned abruptly strode off toward the dub house
fpHE fourth race was Daily Double event the first of the two Doubles of the evening
bet on the winning dog in both Doubles would pay somewhere between forty and ninety dollars depend ing up how the odds came out at the end
Slate idled up to Doubles betting window laid his money got his ticket
It was the only bet he made during the week and he had never won yet but he was persistent patient
Out of the comer of his eye he caught sight of the fat figure of Charley Owen watching the track morosely and not too far away was detective from homicide
Slate ambled over to the detective stood there beside him until he was sure Owen saw him and saw the detective also
The chief is havin all these guys that might know somethin come down to head quarters after the track closes the de tective said
got to tail this bird Owen until then but guess he dont know nothin about this case
Anyhow got to follow him and maybe you better come on down with the crowd Slate
Down to see the chief mean Well be around Herman Slate promised
The homicide detective faded away into the crowd headed for the nearest coffee andsandwich Stand under the grandstand
Nick Slate moved toward Charley Owen stood beside him saying nothing
was looking for Jackwall the fat dog owner said to Slate
He spoke as though only to make conversation but there was depth in his voice that held feeling
About that bet Slate asked
guess Im stuck for that Owen said soberly
No it was about somethng else
Maybe shouldnt tell you
might be wrong You were wrong once tonight Owen Slate touched his coat pocket significantly where the gun he had taken from Owen still made compact hard weight
Did you tell the law about the bet yet took your advice Owen replied evenly
didnt tell them Oh The moneys being held Owen said
Its in the clubhouse safe
dont have to pay him off
He can get it when he wants it after the last race
wanted to ask him something else something Rich ardson told me about few minutes ago Well Slate asked
just want to tell Jackwall Owen said that he wins his gamble in money but he dont want to make any passes at me He shouldnt do that now Slate drawled
Youve had trouble enough for one night Owen
You lost fine dog and trainer and all that money that you and your friends put up He squinted down at the fat man studied him from beneath veiled idleappearing somber lids
Im not hunting trouble Owen stated flatly
know Ive got temper that gets away from me sometimes
But think Id better go see Jackwall just to let him know Owen started to walk off but Slate put hand on his arm
just thought of it Mr Owen
Maybe Id better go in and ask Jackwall to come out and talk with you
Somewhere in back so the law wont Dime Detective Magazine be botherin Jackwallseein yon talk to him By God Owen cried
You seem to be pretty damned interested in protecting that gambler Its not that Mr Owen
Its more like this if you understand me
Bein sort of private detective on the track here my job is sort of to help people not to hinder them
They come here to gamble on the dogs and thats the tracks busi ness
The track hires me so my job is to see that people can gamble here with out being bothered too much He looked sleepily at Owen nodded and walked toward the club house
The band was playing again and the lights were off around the track proper pre paratory to the fanfare of the next race As he turned up the clubhouse steps he saw over his shoulder that Owen was following him slowly hesitantly and that Herman the homicide detective was no where in sight
TVHERE were several groups of people sitting on the clubhouse porch now waiting for the seventh race to flash up men and women in natty light clothes talking laughing
He found Jackwall sitting on the porch railing talking with Richardson on far end of the porch
The two men were talking quietly yet there was an atmosphere of tenseness about them
Slate went straight to them and said to Jackwall That fellow we were talkin about while back Mr Jackwall hed like to see you out back in private right away flash of understanding passed be tween the gambler and the track manager but Slate pretended to miss it
Ill talk with him all right Jackwall growled and got up
Without excusing himself to Richard son he strode away stolid healthy bulk of man with broad snoulders hunched forward as though about to strike
Hes pretty damned mad Richardson said to Slate
Mad and scared
Id say
Yes sir
Jackwalls afraid Owen will holler out loud about that bet and the law will jump on that as motive for killing Owens dog and Owens trainer You think Jackwall did the killing Hell no Richardson exclaimed eagerly
Hes gambler Jackwall is
Hed take the loss if he lost and shut up
Id hate to say he was the killer Slate
Didnt you tell me that whoever killed that trainer killed the dog first Sure Slate agreed
Somebody killed the dog and got caught in the act by this fellow Ribbon and had to kill Rib bon to protect himself
dont believe the cops will catch up with him Mr Richardson but Ive got hunch the murderer has already given himself away
think Ill probably catch him myself sure hope you do Slate Richard son said
And if were you Id take sneak out back and see what those two are up to
One murder on this track is about all we can stand Thats something was sort of plan nin on doin right now Slate said and nodding gloomily moved off through the club house
He went out the back way down the steps into almost complete darkness
The building was near high wall of the tracks outside fence and the lights from the rear windows gave little glow into the gloom beyond
Slate stood near the bottom of the steps moment then moved further away from them listening
He heard Jackwalls voice and Owens
They were talking in low tones angrily but not loud enough so he could hear their words distinctly
In the near distance the band stopped playing
He edged closer to the two men keeping in black shadow himself trying hard to see the positions Race Racket of the two
Then Jackwall said dearly said Id break you and will
If you think Something hard blunt crashed against Nick Slates head
Fire flamed seethed an instant in his brain
His last thought as he fell was of speedthe speed with which he had been attacked
CLATES consdousness returned to him in series of splitting throbs
He moved his hands felt of his head
His hat had fallen off and there was splotch of blood where he touched his hair
He was positive that either Jackwall or Owen could have sneaked up behind him and knocked him out
He got to his feet moving slowly get ting his bearings
As he stood there his feet crunched on glass
At first he paid no attention to it
Then the sensation gnawed at him
He stooped found sev eral pieces on the ground fdt them for thickness
Window glass Perplexity and annoyance made lines on his tanned features
He stood still listening heard the beginning of band music out across the Flagler Street track
But he could not hear voices
Moving ahead through the darkness he saw that Jackwall and Qwen were gone
sudden glow of lights from in front of the club house lightened the darkness as the track lights went on for the start of another race
Nick Slate retraced his steps went back into the club house by the rear door
He stood at the sink in the small kitchen bathed his head brushed cold water over his face and eyes
waiter came into the kitchen eyed him curiously went out again carrying tray of bottles
When the waiter had gone
Slate step ped to the rear window in the kitchen examined it then went to the next win dow
Both were intact locked and their glass was unbroken
He opened one found it moved up without noise
Look ing down he noted that the distance to mans head beneath the window was within arms reach about the right height for blow
He shut the window locked it studied moment and went along the rear wall of the kitchen into pantry
There was one window here locked also but near the lock on the middle sill there was an arc of glass missing that left hole large enough for hand to reach in and un fasten the lock
drawn grim smile began to play over Slates features
He went back into the kitchen down the rear steps along the rear wall of the club house groping his way in the gloomy recess between the racetrack wall and the wall of the building
What he was searching for was not there but he found good substitute for ita solid and fairly large packing box
The box was not under the window but it was close enough so that it could be moved beneath the pantry window with out much trouble
There was wary satisfaction on Slates face as he strode round the clubhouse building to the front
He did not go inside again but ambled into the crowd that still lingered for the last race of the night
He went once more to the Doubles window asked who had won found that he had lost again
He shrugged grinned goodnaturedly strode away toward the dog house
FHE two homicide detectives still leaned against the stalls when he went inside
It was as though they had not moved but there were number of ciga rette butts scattered over the floor around them
Anything new come up he asked
Nothing one of them said
Dime Detective Magazine They got this Owen fellow Slate demanded
Hes been sittm over at the club house waiting
He sort of got over bein mad at us for askin questions
Hes gettin wise Who else is going down to head quarters Slate asked
Most of the track attendants who handle these pooches
The chief hes hellion on details
He says to us we get enough details and hell solve any crime that comes along So this time hes going to make try at gettin the details himself the other detective from homicide explained
All we got to do is stand round and sit round but bet we dont make no pinch unless its this bird Owen Ill try and be there myself Slate said
Youd better
The chiefll want to hear what you got to say about these attend ants with them red monkey suits Richardson the track manager hires them Slate said
Hed be the one the chief should ask about them Hell be there too Slate the second dick said
Hes going to drive down himself so heard him say
Hes got to close up the joint first hasnt he Either Richardson or Riley his assist ant or me Slate told them
Ill be seeing you Yeah but Id rather go home and fall into the hay myself Slate said So would and went back outside
He stayed in the lighted area this time went down to the rail watched the last race come in
The two lead dogs coming down the stretch nose and nose lost their tempers and began fighting
The entire pack smashed past them over the line leaving them still fighting as their two attendants ran down to part them
The crowd howled and some of them swore
There was surge toward the paying booths under the stands
The lights went out around the track as the dogs were led away
Outside the track fence the rumble of cars replaced the usual sound of the band
More lights began blinking out around the track
Slate stood at the rail watching the people move past out through the gate beyond
He turned when Richardson called to him
The track manager was coming along from the club house which was alreadydark
You stick round Slate Richardson directed
Lock up for me
Ive got to go down to police headquarters
When you finish you can come on down your self if you want to find out whats going on
Or maybe you know already Not much more than did while ago Slate replied
Sure Ill lock up
You locked the club house didnt you Riley did Slate said
See you later The track manager walked away went out the gate
Nick Slate still stood there by the rail
He saw Herman and Owen come from under the stand and go out after Rich ardson
few moments later another detective came along stopped
Going down to see the show at head quarters die detective asked
Itll be just routine grilling guess
This is hell of murder case
Its too damned open
Wide open
You coming Later maybe Slate answered
After close up all around The stolid figure of the detective went through the gate disappeared
The two gatemen and the ticket sellers waved and went out
The betting booths were dark gaps in blackness under the main stand
Slate came away from the track rail abruptly started off at brisk walk to ward the dog house
His manner changed completely
The slow wistful gangling movement of features and body became hard tighdy drawn
His eyes smoldered
Race Racket He took flashlight from his pocket blinked it on the dog house went past to the rear fence gate saw it was locked
He made complete rapid circuit of the outer track wall came back to the main stand again slid silently invisibly into the darkness
TjXDR fully five minutes Slate stood in the blackness under the stand listen ing but no sound reached his ears save the rumble of earn outside on the street the occasional lilt of voices as people passed
He was alone in the trackalone so far as he knew
But there had been dead dog and dead man that night and there had been fish knife heaved at him in the darkness earlier while thousand people stood within hailing distance
Nick Slate like shadow began to slide noiselessly toward the club house He went between the wall of the track and the club building hugged the track wall where the lights from the street and buildings outside did not reach him
He held the flash in his left hand his own gun in his right
The gun he had taken from Charley Owen still made weight in his coat pocket
There was long moment as he moved forward when he could see absolutely nothing
Then vaguely he discerned the lack of something that he had seen there earlier
Steadying his eyes he strained into the blackness
His head nodded slowly methodically like man who has made chess move that he has figured out well in advance and which satisfies him
The box he had spotted had been moved
It was directly beneath the pantry window and the window was open from the bottom wide enough for man to enter with comparative ease
sense of disaster began to gnaw at Slate as he stood there in darkness sense of futility
It was one thing to track criminal to wait outside for him to come out
It was another thing to go in after him singlehanded
But there was that front door and side door besides that could be opened from within
There was not much chance of anyone entering by window and emerging by the same route with two doors offering quick easy exit
Yet there was reason too
There was Slate himself Once more that hard grin came upon his features
He moved over to the box pocketed his flash but held his gun ready as he climbed up
He balanced himself tried to hear sounds that could not be heard then swung leg over the window sill swung his body inside stood on the pantry floor
The pantry door was shut
He pushed it open gently slowly stepped into the small kitchen of the club house
Moving to the center of the kitchen he stood silent straining ears and eyes
slow methodical drip drip drip of water from faucet was the only sound
He orient ated himself found the kitchen swing door leading into the front part of the building
He went through it into large room that he knew was laid out with tables and chairs and settees
Standing quietly poised on the balls of his feet he heard for the first time muffled sound that was like heavy ham mering on metal in confined closed space
The sound kept up with the per sistence of the dripping water in the kitchen
Slate moved toward the noise realized as he moved that he was headed for the clubhouse office the office used by Rich ardson and Riley the room where the larger bets were laid on the dogs
The pounding stopped abruptly started again louder then stopped entirely with resounding thud and something that wa like an echo of the thud
Dime Detective Magazine Slate started forward quickly jerked out his torch
His body hit chair careened off it as he tried to steady him self
He swung against table tried to catch his balance by putting hand oa it
The table tipped went over crashed to the floor
With curse
Slate sprang aside flicked on his electric flash tried to aim it at the office door
TTE found tlje wall with the light then JL the door panel
His senses warned him that the door was already opening
flash of fire burst from the doorway before he could spring aside
The flash light in his left hand shattered and his hand felt numb and sticky
second explosion blasted from the doorway and slug plowed through the flesh of his left leg above the knee
Slate staggered
His own gun jerked in his rght hand the muzzle streaking out jet of fire
He shot again and tripped over chair
body hurtled through the blackness hot breath panted against his face and fist hammered against his mouth loos ened teeth drew blood that tasted warm salty
He swung his gun again missed completely
And as suddenly as the attack had started it ended
The fingers jerked away from his throat
The body on top of him leaped off crashed against furniture
The sounds started to die away
Nick Slate swore shook himself into renewed activity
He struggled to his feet wobbled moment plunged after the retreating sounds his arms flaying tables and chairs aside as he ran
The kitchen door slammed back into his face as he lunged at it in the darkness
He bounced away swung up his gun fired and kicked the door wide open
There was no answering fire
He plunged through the doorway swung to ward the pantry heard bang realized the pantry door had opened and ckraed
He handled dove at it His shoulder burst it open the wrong way sent it splintering down off its hinges
He went to his knees saw vague figure dropping off the window sill to the ground outside
Slate threw up his gun but the target had disappeared
He roared at the figure scrambled to his feet went through the window taking the sash with him
He missed the box under the window completely went over it and felt shat tered glass and broken splinters dig into his hands and knees as he landed
He leaped to his feet whirled staring about him
The figure was rounding the corner of the club house
faint glow of light out lined it from higher building over the track fence
Slate fired his gun as he ran
The figure stumbled turned fired back at him then ran on
Somewhere outside police whistle shrilled three times was followed by an answering whistle further off
The figure hit the shadow of the fence whirled crouched
Flame burst from the mans gun
The slug creased Slaters head
Slate dropped to one knee took aim saw the figure suddenly leap up into the air clutch at the top of the fence
The gun jerked in Slates hand again
He saw the figure erk as though in response heard muffled curse
Then the man had his leg over the fence top was pawing his way over
Nick Slate swore lunged up and for ward
He forgot the gun in his hand as he ran
Then he was in the air diving upward his arms stretched ahead of him
The figure halfway over the fence kicked out at him
The shoe caught Slate square in the face made stars against blackness in his head
His arms encircled the mans leg elung there as Slates body Race Racket swung down dragging hauling the figure back off the fence
The man fired once more as he fell
The bullet slugged along Slates back seared his flesh thudded into the ground
Then the two men were down pawing kicking slugging with fists and guns
GLATE twisted heaved rolled got on top
His fist hammered into the mans belly hammered again
The figure swung up at the torso spat blood coughed flopped back again
Slate crashed his fist into the stomach again sprang to his feet jerked the man upright
voice bellowed on the other side of the track fence near them and another voice joined the first
Come over the fence Slate shouted
Bring light But even as he called peculiar ex pression came over his bloody features
His eyes gleamed and once again there was satisfaction in his eyes
He shook the man in his grip
Richardson he muttered
Richardson damn you snap out of it Slate put his hands in the track man agers pocket went through his clothes and his fists came out holding two thick wads of bills bound with heavy rubber bands
torch blinked at them from the fence top then swung down as the cop jumped to the ground
What th hells goin on here he demanded
Its pinch Slate growled at them
Thats all it is pinch He glanced over his shoulder blinked into the light held on him and demanded belligerently Go get an ambulance one of you and call police headquarters
Tell em Damn Richardson said suddenly
Ill tell em myself Sure the cop said
Take it easy there guy The second cop ran down the track toward the phone booths under the grand stand
Slate said to the cop with them You
Get out that book of yours and write it down
This birdll sign it
Its confession The cop fumbled inside his coat pro duced notebook pencil
Slate said as though reciting but with tired inflection wanted the hundred grand Charley Owen and Harry Jack wall gave me to hold for them as bet money on three races between OwenS Fu Man chu and Jackwalls Tinpan
tried to stall off the races by killing Owens dog to give me time to get the money out tonight before the bet was over
Owens trainer caught me and had to kill him
His name was Jeff Ribbon The cop scribbled moment said Yup
Go on with it got afraid of Nick Slate and tried to scare him off
threw knife at him but he wouldnt scare
set Owen and Jackwall against each other so they would get into fight and get arrested
That was to give me more time to steal their money
knocked Slate out at the same time so could fix up the clubhouse window for an entrance
opened the safe after sneaked back here through the dog gate took the money and knocked the knob off the safe to make it look like an ordinary robbery Slate said when the cop had finished writing that Now Richardson you snap out of it long enough to sign this state ment or Ill break you into plenty of pieces
Sign it Richardson blinked coughed signed his name
And you Slate said to the cop put down there somewhere how this confes sion is of his own free will and accord or whatever it is The cop said Geez guy and wrote it out
The Seventh Cedar Seven Cedars was the name over the gateway to that house of horror yet only she gaunt evergreens stood on the lawn
Dinner for seven at seven oclock the host had indicated
Yet only six sat down at table
What was the sinister meaning of the mis sing sevens
What ghastly joke was Septimus Cedara seventh son playing on that sextet of lost souls
Do you remember she challenged weaving there in the gloom
by Allan Vaughan Elston Author of Star Witness etc
CHAPTER ONE Port of Missing Brides EYOND the arched gate lawn sloped up in steep green sweep to the house
It was tall eaveless structure noted shuttered and severely colonial
Midway on its lawn six cedar trees were growing in row
They were about ten paces apart and obviously had been planted
Six of these cedars there were no more no less
Dime Detective Magazine Why six
Seven Cedars was the name boldly inscribed over the gate
And recalled that the stationery of my client Captain John Temple which bore the message summoning me to this North Jersey coun try estate was likewise engraved Seven Cedars
Yet the number of cedars was definite six
Wheremy mind instantly and inev itably inquiredwas the seventh cedar
After driving through die arched gate and circling the lawn parked in court to the left of the house
was but minute or so late Temple having asked me to call at six oclock
At my knock the door of the house was opened by bald old bullethead who im mediately struck me as an Orientaland tough one
His thin leatherbrown face was seamed and pitted
scar the full width of his forehead was deep and frightful
battered old customer from somewhere east of Arabia decided probably Hindu
PHE fellow backed away from me bowing awkwardly with which crab like progress he lured me into gunroom on the right of the hall
There found Captain Temple in the company of young collegian in creamy flannels
This younger man was pacing the floor with such morbid preoccupation that he did not notice my entrance
Here you are Conroy
Good John Temple stocky and solid prematurely gray greeted me with his hardfisted grip
Bud meet my attorney Conroy
Con roy this is Bud Arkles Young Arkles relaxed long enough to shake hands
Look sharp Rokh Temple then said to his EastIndian servant
And remem ber youre to serve dinner for seven promptly at seven Rokh backed from the room
As my eyes followed him became more and more convinced that the fellow should have been stevedoring around Singapore rather than butlering in New Jersey
Once he was gone Temple was all busi ness
He looked at his watch snapped it shut with dick and said Theres deal to tell you in less than an hour Con roy
Will you sit down You want legal advice presume queried taking chair
Nothing like that he said
just want you as witness to showdown due during the evening at this house Naturally was bewildered
show down on what issue An affair of mystery Conroy
And if Ive tagged him rightly the villain of the piece will dine with us at seven And my role will be Merely to size him up Temple said
Keep your eyes open and your reason pliable
Youre supposed to have judi cial mind so want your reactions Cant we be getting along com plained young Arkles
He jerked fret fully toward us again plowing hand through his shock of reddish hair
Weve less than an hour you know Right
Briefly heres the situation Conroy From now on Temples voice drove like the piston of an engine
Three years ago one Septimus Cedar seventh son was honeymooning in the South Seas
His bride was approached on the dark deck one night by Lascar sailor who whispered to her warning
The lady though startled was incredulous
She refused to believe the terrible crimes which the whispering lascar imputed to her husband Septimus Cedar
Seeing that his warning was in vain the lascar begged her not to speak of it And did she asked
She did not
Otherwise she would have brought her husbands wrath heavily on the mans head The Seventh Cedar Just what warning did the Lascar whisper inquired to the bride of Septimus Cedar For the last minute had been staring thoughtfully out window regarding those evenly spaced six cedars
And still pondering on that misnomer over the arched gateway Seven Cedars
Then saw that my host and client John Temple was pulling bell cord
In response the bald old bullethead of an East Indian came sidling into the room
Rokh Temple said to him the gen tleman would like to know just what words of warning you spoke on dark deck in the South Seas to the bride of Septimus Cedar TEVELATIQN that it was Rokh who had passed that warning shocked me
Yet hadnt missed his pedigree far after all
Instead of Singapore stevedore the man was Lascar sailor
He answered bluntly in surprisingly glib English say to lady You are bis fifth when he tires of you he will push you into deep pit
It was so with the others Did the lady believe you prompted Temple
She do not believe me master What became of her Rokh Her maid she tell me the lady be downstairs right away master That quite staggered me
You mean to say gasped that Let the lady speak for herself Tem ple cut in
Come Temple led us out of the gunroom and across the hall to spacious library
We had been there barely minute when slim and pretty woman in her upper thirties judged joined us
She was brunette of grace and charm and liked her at once
It was plain that Temple did too
Ah here you are Alicia He moved quickly almost eagerly to her and took both her hands
In the next short second of time glimpsed new Temple
His irongray grimness was for that instant swept away
He was like courtier ardent greeting his lady love
Yet when he turned about he was again his old stony self
Alicia this is Mr Conroy my attorney
Conroy this is Miss Carterall Cant we skip the formalities and be getting along wth it came impatiently from Bud Arkles
And suddenly real ized how nervously impatient they all were
was myself
Most of all was this Slim dark lady whose fingertips were now touching my own
Those fingers were icy
Her poise was too rigid to be natural
knew that she was laboring under some grave tension
He is right
Let us be getting on with it Mr Conroy she said
Know then that although have chosen to assume my maiden name actually am the di vorced wife of Septimus Cedar That forthrightness helped to collect my wits
To collect them further tried to imagine that she was witness in court and the interviewing attorney
You were cruising with your husband some three years ago were you asked
Yes she said
And did Lascar sailor warn you as follows You are his fifth when he tires of you he will push you into deep pit
It was so with the others Yes Mr Conroy Temple was placing chair for her
She sat on the edge of it not at all rest fully
She was not dressed for dinner party
Temple in fact had mentioned that two of the guests would walk directly here from nearby golf course
now asked What of importance fol lowed the incident of the warning Miss Carterall little while later she said we ioe Dime Detective Magazii went ashore on an island
was walking with my husband in the moonlight up jungle path toward cliff overlooking the sea
Suddenly the dark mouth of pit loomed directly in front of me
felt Mr Cedars grip tighten on my arm
His face was changed
It was terrible
knew that the warning was truethat he meant to push me into that pit TTER voice raised as she said that end ing in note of almost wild hysteria
could see now the scars of pain in her eyes and faint dark circles beneath them
One knew at once that trail of tragedy lay behind her
Young Arkles all this while was standing by fretting fuming
Since he was barely more than callow collegian couldnt quite see where he figured
As for Temple he was standing at Alicias elbow like stocky Gibralter his knotty fists clenched
And so what did you do managed to inquire
was terrified she said
broke away and ran into the jungle
He came after me shouting
ran frantically on through the dark He never caught you He did not thank God This answer came fervently from John Temple
Temple himself resumed the testimony
week later he told me she was picked up by tramp freighter calling in to trade with natives at far end of that same island
Its small island by the way until recently uncharted somewhere between the Fijis and the Tongas Hit the high spots wont you begged Arkles
Its half past six myself Temple said was super numerary on the tramp
Alicia had suf fered frightful exposure had endured fever was at times delirious
made it my business to take her to hospital in Honolulu
Later as she convalesced there she told me what she has now told you And what did you do set out to find Septimus Cedar raging storm was hidden within the calm with which Captain Temple spoke
You went first suggested to the place she last saw him Yes
And found the pit
It was good hundred feet deep
Anyone pushed into it would surely be killed
But had my self lowered on rope to its bottom didnt want to ask the next question
Thinking of it made cold spot form at the base of my spine
Nothing was there Temple offered to my immeasurable relief
Yet for that there was an obvious reason
tunnel of sorts led from the bottom of the pit and broke into daylight at the base of marine cliff
The tunnel was merely wavewashed crevice through the faulty rock
At every high tide the sea surged through it although at low tide the bot tom of the pit was dry His point was clear enough
high tide swirling into the pits bottom twice day would receding tend to suck all light objects such as shells and bones with it
Weeks and months of such hy draulic action would swab the pit clean
By what excuse questioned did Septimus Cedar in turn with each of five wives visit the island He had bamboo bungalow at the place Temple said
He kept care taker there an old clubfooted derelict by the name of Hargis What became of Hargis myself found the body of Hargis abed in the bamboo bungalow
The indi cations led me to believe that he had died of fever And Cedar Was last seen in those parts by Rokh Captain Temple clapped his hands vigor ously
In moment Rokh appeared
Hot on the trail of the mystery The Seventh Cedar Temple explained soon found Rokh
His testimony struck me as sincere and it matches Alicias
Come Rokhgive ft to Mr Conroy as briefly as possible have the only seagoing launch at Palika Rokh said
His response came so quickly that it might have been re hearsed
Where wanted to know is Pali ka Whats the difference Bud Arkles complained
If you must know Palika is village on an island separated by about tenhour deepwater cruise from Cedars bungalow
Get along Rokh TkOKH continued
Four times Mr Ce dar he charter my launch to go with very new wife to this very pretty island
He have very nice bungalow there
Each time we get there he tell me go back to Palika
He say maybe he live there little while with new wife
Always next time see him at Palika he have another new wife
Five plenty nice wives he take to this very pretty island Naturally you got suspicious eh Rokh Temple prompted
So when you beached him there with his fourth bride you did bit of spying
Instead of heading out to sea on your return trip to Palika you prowled up through the jungle to see what you could see Rokh nodded his bald brown head vig orously
And what did you see see Mr Cedar push wife into pit So what did you do then put to sea for Palika You reported the murder there asked severely
When Rokh shook his head Temple came quickly to his rescue
Theres no police force at Palika he said
Then he tried to make me understand that Rokh had lived too long amongst savages to concern himself with the uxori cides of Nordic
And what man did with his own property wife by the East ern code being mans property was not vitally Rokhs business
He was however convinced that the same fate had befallen the other three wives of Septimus Cedar
He knew that he had taxied them all to the island and never seen them again
New was able to find anyone who ever saw them again Temple said
put in year at it Are you sure they ever existed was eying the Lascar suspiciously
Quite sure of it Temple said
Many of the Palika natives saw Septimus Cedar on each of the five occasions when he embarked from there with wife Gravely and sympathetically faced Alicia Carterall Cedar
She was staring straight ahead her face pallid from the shock of these recollections
John Tem ple stood with brawny hand on her shoulder
Dinner for seven at seven oclock Temple had said
We here in the room were only four
Three more there fore were due
turned brusquely toward Rokh
So while you werent setting the law on this man Cedar you did summon up enough human decency to warn his fifth wife
Later she escaped the clutches of Cedar and was rescued by your present master
In the meantime after his vain pursuit of his wife what did Septimus Cedar do He bring his baggage down to the beach and say we go back to Palika
We go back to Palika
On the way there he knock me overboard with capstan bar and go on alone Temple nodded confirmation
Palika fishermen picked Rokh up half drowned
His launch was found beached just around headland from Palika
Cedar disappeared bag and baggage
He was never seenuntil Alicia and spotted him not long ago in New York You were living in New York then asked
Dime Detective Magazine Yes
hadnt bought this country place then
In fact bought it for the sole reason that the man we think is Septimus Cedar lives directly across the road fjPHAT left me gasping
Yet in one illuminating flash saw Temples strategy
He was challenging Cedar
Every time the man fared forth from his house he must see this onewith its bold suggestion of missing seventh cedar
had six mature cedars planted by forester Temple explained
That thought would at least get rise out of him You mean that he denies hes Septi mus Cedar Stoutly
That is rang up his house from pay station and asked for Septi mus Cedar
This is the house of Leonard Landren the man himself answered
No such person as Septimus Cedar has ever been here Are you sure its the same man Alicia is sure of it
He hasnt seen her yet but shes managed to see him many times
Having been his wife she should be competent to identify him What about Rokh Rokh also positively identifies Lan dren as Cedar Temple said
Have you accused the man asked
Temple shook his head
In court or out of it he said he would simply deny he is Cedar
Then the case against him would fall flat And even if identified thought the case against Cedar would be weak
His assault on Alicia was not committed but merely contemplated
His alleged mur ders of the first three wives were not witnessed
As to the fourth the only witness was Rokh
Rokh would make none too convincing witness
Aside from all that was the matter of jurisdic tion
New Jersey courts were not con cerned with South Sea murders
Temple admitted all that
Alicia wanted to leave the entire busines alone he said
In fact she insisted on it until new development forced us to act And that inquired
Is that Septimus Cedar is about to take to himself sixth bride Temple an nounced gravely
Shes local girl just out of school and sowell we just cant let it happen Ill say we wont Bud Arkles barked savagely whacking fist into his other palm
Ill see him in hell first damn him At last was able to catalogue Arkles
The boy was of course either kinsman or close friend of the sixth bridetobe
When bluntly asked him which the question confused him
Temple answered quickly for him
close friend Con roy
They went to school together So then knew that Arkles was dis appointed sweetheart
neighborhood romance no doubt with its bud just ripen ing when along had come the dashing and muchmarried Septimus Cedar to spoil everything
You can see my own position Con roy Temple said
could hardly go to the girl or her parents with my evi dence in its present form saw that clearly
Yet Alicia is determined to save this young girl
Eve Marland from tying up with Cedar
The man is twice the girls age but he fascinates her
Since he would deny the identity it would do no good merely to warn the girl
So Alicia sug gested that we frighten him away
tried that with row of six cedars and misnomer on the gate but it produced no results So next confided in Bud Arkles
So we plotted to meet Landren and Miss Mar The Seventh Cedar land as though by accident on golf course
There Bud introduced me as friend
cultivated the acquaintance until it was mature enough to warrant inviting them to dinner Except for the contradiction of six Cedars and the name over your gate has the man any reason to suspect you as challenger
None at all
have kept Rokh out of sight
And Alicia with her maid only arrived this afternoon Just then the mantel clock struck seven
Theyre due now Temple said
Fve invited them for dinner tonight Septimus Cedar and his sixth asked
Then heard the front door ringing eerily through the house
There they are John Temple said grimly
Try to compose yourself Alicia
Rokh show them in CHAPTER TWO Dinner for Seven TOKH went to confront the man who unless we were absurdly astray he had last encountered on the occasion of being batted overboard with capstan bar
And here among us Alicia Carterall sat waiting with such strained tension that we were all bound to share it
Sep timus Cedar we knew did not expect to see her here
Nor had he seen her at all since she had broken away from him at the death pit
moved to the hall arch spying past the drapes there
wanted look at the fellows face at the first instant of his contact with Rokh
If guilty surely such startling encounter would surprise him into making some move or exclamation which would give himself away
When it distinctly failed to do so was almost ready to drop the case against Leonard Landren
He looked Rokh straight in the eyes without even flush
Well here we are Eve he said easily to the pretty young girl who entered with him
With nonchalance not overdone he tossed his golf cap to the lascar and said Were Miss Marland and Mr Landren
And not late hope As Rokh came backing toward my por tieres they followed him
got out of the way just in time
Then took post from which could size up the man at his first sight of Alicia
She saw was braced as for blinding shock
She was seated directly in front of and facing the hall arch
The caller was bound to see her first of all when he entered the room
He did see her
But again he failed to flush
He permitted his eyes to rest upon her for moment impersonally then quite calmly at ease he looked about for Temple
Hello Buddy
And how do you do Mr Temple Those greetings came from Eve Marland
This girl seemed even younger than had been led to believe
Temple making the best of it intro duced them to Alkia Carterall
Then he presented me
In Alicia Landren seemed to take no more interest than is the due of any pretty woman
single glance at Landren and one could understand why the girl had found him attractive
He was not only finely built and handsome but he had the way of man who has been everywhere and knows everything
One of my guests heard John Temple say has not arrived
We shall not however wait long Landren dropped easily into chair beside Alicia
You live hereabouts Miss Carterall He faced her smiling pleasantly
Which showed thought that he could not pos sibly be the rogue we wanted
After push ing four wives into pit surely no human could thus face fifth who had escaped him
In this encounter it was the woman Dime Detective Magazine who was agitated
No live in New York she said and looked so upset that went to her rescue
Youre an old settler here in Sussex County are you Mr Landren Landren laughed
Not never set tle long in one spot
Been here though nearly year
Rather like it WENT out into the hall and found Rokh
See here said
Is that the fellow you knew in the South Seas as Septimus Cedar He are the man Rokh said
He hit me here knock me off boat Returning to the library found Eve and Arkles still paired while Landren was engaged by some question of Tem ples
That gave me chance for whis pered aside with Alicia
Is he Septimus Cedar asked
She nodded quickly
am positive We were presumed waiting for the seventh guest
half dozen times be tween seven oclock and seven thirty John Temple looked at his watch and frowned
Who kept wondering was this person for whom we waited
At seven thirty Temple said to Rokh Ring him up Rokh and find out if hes coming The lascar went out
He returned in about three minutes and reported that he had been unable to call the belated guest because the telephone was out of order
Well wait no longer Temple said
He offered an arm to Eve Marland
Without batting an eye Leonard Landren offered his to Alicia who by the record of testimony had been his fifth wife
She was game enough to take it though plainly she loathed the man
Temple and Eve Marland led the way into the hall followed by Landren and Alicia
The leftovers Arkles and myself went next while Rokh brought up the rear
In the dining room we found table set for seven
There was no light other than candles aligned from end to end of the table
Each candle stick noted was shaped like the bole of tree and had the look and smell of red cedar
There were seven of these candlesyet only six of them were lighted
No apology was made for the unlighted candle
There it was we could make of it what we would
John Temple took the head of the table placing Eve at his left and Alicia at his right was directed to the far end
Landren was placed next to Alida
His position was such that the unlighted candle stood squarely before him
On the other side of the table places were set for three
Two of these posi tions were occupied by Eve Marland and Bud Arkles
They did not sit next to each other though
Between them was an empty chairthe place presumably of the unarrived guest
This vacant seat was directly across from Landren with the unlighted candle directly between
An odd arrangement surely yet polite guest could hardly question it Nor did Temple refer to it
All the while knew he was posing an insidious challenge be fore Landren
ANDREN bafflingly composed di rected lively chatter at Alicia
He drew from her barely more than one word responses while Eve had no better luck with Arkles
Buddys feeling lowspirited Eve said across the table
Tell him funny story Leonard and cheer him up Landren knew funny stories and how to tell them
He took ready command of the conversation through three courses served awkwardly by Rokh
The lascar when not engaged took post directly back of the empty chair
There he would stand with his bald bullet head inclined forward and his eyes fixed in baleful stare at Landren
Occasion The Seventh Cedar ally he touched the deep scar on his fore head
And Landren faced it with no visi ble disconcertion
With apparently per fect innocence he faced the unlighted can dle the empty chair and Rokh
Nor did the presence of Alicia at his side in any way upset the mans aplomb
was aroused to envy at the way in which he served her pretty compliments
There was false note somewhere though
And at last placed it
It was that Landren was too composed
He was ignoring the evident tension of Alicia
An innocent man decided would note that he would perhaps make some com ment on it or at least he would permit it to guide the flow of his chatter
Eve by now had noticed it
She knew something was afoot was looking askance now and then from one to an other of us
And that realized was natural reaction of innocence
Innocence would feel the tension in the air and be subdued by it
It subdued Eve Marland
Yet Landren quite ignored it
Suddenly knew that Landren was guilty as Satan himself
He was Septi mus Cedar as Alicia said
Rokh was staring steadily at him now across the empty chair and the unlighted candle
Which reminded me that didnt yet know for whom the empty chair had been provided
Hastily reviewed the testimony of Rokh of Alicia and of Tem ple
Most of the characters involved were assembled here
Was one of them absent
There was and after moment of thought placed him
What about that old clubfooted caretaker Hargis
But Hargis was dead
Temple himself had found him dead
Even so did the chair signify Hargis confronting Landren in line with the unlighted candle
TVTOW well along in Landrens account of tiger hunt the bell of the front door rang shrilly
It cut raucously in on Landrens recital and he was forced to pause while Temple said to Rokh There he is at last
Well better late than never
Show him in Rokh The lascar withdrew
Stepping into the front hall he closed the diningroom door behind him
Then he went forward to the main entrance of the house
We heard him open the door heard the faint hum of his voice as he greeted caller
He came back along the hall conduct ing the visitor toward us
We could not see but we could hear
What we heard was limping clumping tread
Certain indication that this caller progressed un der the handicap of some pedal affliction
He came bumping along down the hall with an uneven cadence as would man with wooden leg or club foot
Of course not for Hargis was dead
But Startled breathless almost forgot to watch Landren
When did look his way he seemed to be no mare than mild ly curious
Certainly there were no moist beads on his forehead
Clump clump
The steps reached the very door of our room
Then we were let down ridiculously
The lame visitor turned to one side down narrower hall which knew led to the study
In moment Rokh came in alone
Who was it Rokh Temple asked
Man come to fix telephone Did only imagine that smile of de rision formed for an instant on the lips of Landren
Was the man laughing in his sleeve at this futile trap set by Temple
thought could read defeat on my hosts face
Had he played his last card
saw him shrug his strong broad shoul ders then his eyes met Alicias
And now as Temple weakened Alicia seemed to grow more determined
The resolution of her slim trim shoulders the set of her lips assured me that she did not mean to give up
Landrens marriage with Eve Marland was due within the Dime Detective Magazine weekunless Alicia Carterall and John Temple succeeded in revealing the true identity of monstrous murderer
CHAPTER THREE The Man with the Club Foot INNER over our procession back to the library was in different order
Alicia took possession of John Temple while Eve followed with her fiance
The older woman managed that in frantic effort to hold council of war
When reached the library Alicia had my host and client aside in an alcove
could see that she was insisting upon some move to which he objected
Suddenly Temple beckoned to me
Nothings left he said in sotto voice but to accuse the devil to his face
My idea now is to take him into the study alone and give him until midnight to get out of the state forever
In that case we promise not to tell the facts to Eve and her family agreed that the kindest thing we could do would be to let the girl think Landren merely hounding deserter
But Alicia objected
She wanted to ac cuse Landren was sure she could do it more effectively than anyone else
While they argued Rokh took the is sue quite out of their hands
His voice startled us
Turning quickly we saw that he was addressing not Landren but Eve Marland
You are his sixth the lascar said to Eve
When he tires of you he will push you into deep pit
It was so with the others Rokh bowed caressed the scar on his forehead and fixed steady gaze on Lan dren
Then while we were all still gasp ing he backed from the room
Landren gaped after him
Then he turned with an assured smile and asked of Temple Is he screwy Eve after moment of speechless shock exclaimed It isnt at all funny
dont like it
want you to take me home Alicia went to her beseechingly
Please be warned she said
myself heard that same warning and didnt believe it
was as loyal and trusting as you are now
And yet later he tried to push me into pit thought the girl would scream
But it seemed to freeze on her lips as she shrunk away from Alicia and clung close to Landrens arm
If its joke dont like it at all she said faintly
was his wife Alicia insisted
His right name is Septimus Cedar Landrens expression had been amused ly tolerant
Now it became bit impatient
Im like Eve he said
If this is joke it doesnt wash down bit His arm went around the girl
Lets go home Leonard She took his arm and urged him toward the door
But Landren didnt retreat
If theres music he said with shrug to Alicia lets face it
Do you really think Im someone else know you were my husband Septi mus Cedar Thats perfectly wild Eve protested
Please sit down wont you Alicia urged her gently
You must hear what have to say Do Eve Landren himself seconded
prefer to stand the girl said
She was perfectly sure saw that Landren was impeccable
TEGINNING her story Alicia spoke directly to Eve in tone infinitely gentle and compassionate
You will know tell the truth she said because of what it costs me
When am through man who has honored me with an offer of his namfe will forever despise me
have told him only part of the truth
When he hears the rest of it he will know me for cheat and hate me The Seventh Cedar Beyond doubt she was referring to John Temple
saw blank astonishment grow now on Temples face
Beyond any doubt he had been asking Alicia to marry him all of these past three years
Now em bodied in her warning to Eve she was telling him why she had refused
When Septimus Cedar met and mar ried me Alicia said was trapeze performer in an Australian circus by sum mer
Winters had bit parts in stock company
Soon after he married me Mr Cedar put me up at Honolulu hotel and went away on business
He was scouting for new pearl beds he said
At bamboo bungalow which he kept on an almost deserted island he came upon fugitive thief
He recognized the man as Guy Affering trust officer who once absconded from New York with large fortune in cash Guy Affering
Immediately remem bered the case
The man had absconded years ago with more than million dol lars and had never been found
Eve was still highchinned and hostile toward Alicia and Landren was still half tolerant and half impatient But Alicia had their ears anyway
Arkles Temple and moved closer
To one side glimpsed Rokh as he peered from be hind the draperies at the hall arch
My husband Alicia said accosted ffie fugitive by his right name
Affering an old man with misshapen foot at first denied the Identity
But after few nights of heavy drinking he admitted he was Affering
What of it
His only crime was larceny and from here they could not extradite him
In any case the cash was safely buried on the island
To get it for himself my husband took pains to woo the confidence of Affering
He befriended the old cripple who was in ill health from succession of fevers and half mad from lonely brooding
He told Affering to make himself at home at the bungalow
If anyone chanced to stop by he could call himself Hargis thg caretaker Landren interrupted
Do under stand he inquired without heat that when you say your husband Septimus Cedar you refer to myself do Alicia said keeping her gaze on Eve
Eve was the color of chalk
To her Landren whispered Its crazy dear
But lets hear her out Nights of drinking there with Affer ing Alicia said disclosed to my hus band the reasons for the old mans in sane brooding
Safely aflight and using new name Affering had married young blond girl at San Diego California
Forty years his junior she had married him for his money with the idea of spend ing it with chosen lover
Old Affering found that out when she filed suit for divorce and half his estate on trumped up charge
He didnt dare fight the suit because it would expose him fugitive to the scrutiny of the courts
So he ran off taking all his cash with him to South America
It was during that period of his career that street car crushed his foot maiming him for life
Three times later in his wanderings he again married each time to young girl
His second was Chilena at Iqueque his third Russian in the Slavic colony at Shanghai his fourth was Kanaka girl from the island of Maui
The Chilena probably played fair with him Alicia said
But the old man was jealous of her young friends
He was bitter in state of mind to imagine in fidelities
His next the Shanghai Russian was tartar
She tried to poison him
Affering found it out and left her for the Kanaka on Maui where again he imagined infidelities which did not exist
He ended up half crazy with bitterness at my hus bands bamboo refuge on the island
Dime Detective Magazine There in his drinking bouts with my husband he constantly heaped impreca tions against his four deserted wives
should have throttled them all he would rage
If werent coward and cripple Id go back and do it now tTVHE ordeal of this recital was taking terrific toll from Alicia
She halted it for moment during which tried to picture the mentality of Affering as he rotted amongst the weeds of his bitter ness on that island
One night in his cups Alicia said he offered to give all of his money to the man who would do it for him
My husband was interested
He led the dis cussion on
Immediately he saw way to deceive the old manhe saw way to make it appear that the four women were murdered when really there was no vio lence at all
His first idea was to go away and return in suitable time with faked news accounts telling of four sepa rate homicides
Now he bargained with Affering through many nights of drinking
Finally he got the names and addresses of the four women
But Affering was sharp enough to see the news accounts could be faked
So he would not trust them
fThe four women must be brought to the island one by one and killed before Affer ings eyes
Affering coward would him self have no contact with the crimes
He would merely watch from distance
Then he would pay the price Eve Marland by now was gripped with horror
One small white fist was pushed against her lips
Landren stood with his arm around her keenly attentive
What struck me most forcibly was the revela tion that the four wives were not after all Cedars but Afferings
My husband Alicia resumed pre tended to agree
One of the approaches to the bamboo bungalow was path be side which was deep pit
The plot finally hatched was this as the agent ar rived in turn with each wife he would lead her toward the bungalow along that path
Affering would be watching from the bungalow
certain signal would sig nify that he saw the couple coming
Then in each case the agent would topple the victim into the pit My throat was dry when asked But surely you Miss Carterall didnt agree to lend yourself to any such monstrous deceptions She shot pleading glance toward John Temple
thought was lending my self only to the saving of four lives Temples hand was on her shoulder
Of course Alicia he said gently
could see now why she had refrained from telling him of these horrors before
Though her motives at the time were honest later knowledge of the facts had shamed her
She bared them now only as last bitter resort to warn Eve Marland
Affering gave my husband four letters one to each wife
Each letter said he was side and dying and for the woman to come
Theyll come fast enough he said bitterly for they each want my money My husband then went to Honolulu where had been all this while
He told me about the plan but entirely distorted his motive for pretending to comply
He is very persuasive man
Miss Marland
And was infatuated with him as you are now
His method of pretending to comply was this we would go in turn to San Diego Iqueque Shanghai and Maui
Without accosting any of them we would observe each woman who had worked on the stage would prepare costume and makeup for each one
The motive he gave me for pretend ing to comply was that if he refused then Affering would seek another agent
Ha would entrust those errands of murder to the first beachcomber who came along
The Seventh Cedar and in the end his offer would be ac cepted
So why not make him think the crimes had been consummated
What harm would there be in deceiving him
My husband glib and convincing made me think it fine chivalrous crusade
For pay Affering would give my husband the cash fortune which would then be sent anonymously to the New York trust com pany from which it had been embezzled
Dont you see every end of justice would be served
TOR moment we were all breathless
Instead of being absurdly fantastic the thing now was really beginning to seem neatly plausible
Yet Landren chose to exclaim Amaz ing my dear young lady
As under stand the first four wives were Affer ings only the fifth was mine and she doubled for the victims at each murder His vein of sarcasm was plain enough
Alicia ignored him faced Eve
We did it she said
Four times from distance the rheumy eyes of Affering saw me pushed into the pit
But swing had been erected in it in each case un beknownst to Affering
As an extrapeze artist it was easy for me to catch the swing then to lower myself on rope to the bottom
From there crawled through the tunnel to the beach hiding under the cliff until my husband had chance to pick me up Did you deceive Affering on all four occasions asked
We thought we did but probably we didnt
Or maybe Affering simply welched on the bargain
Anyway he declined to turn over the money
was at Nukualofa when it happened
But when my husband returned to me he did not admit the failure
He told me that he had received the money from Affering and had shipped it anonymously to the rightful owners For what reason would he tell you that To keep me from writing letters of warning to the four threatened wives
If did that would start hornets nest buzzing
Affering would soon have visi tors
He would no longer be private mark for my husband who still hoped to get the money
After while Alicia told us be gan to worry about Affering
He was now just broken old cripple sick and dying on lonely island
had conspired to deceive him so now thought of him and pitied him
insisted that we take him supplies of food and medicine
When my husband agreed mistook his motive for kindness
Actually he merely wanted to stalk that buried fortune once again
We went
This time was in my true character
Rokh did not recognize me as the Nordic blonde the Iqueque Chilena the Shanghai Slav or the brown Kanaka he had transported on earlier occasions
Thinking me fifth wife he warned me AT THAT statement of Alicias could no longer doubt any part of the story
It made Rokhs testimony match perfectly with Alicias
Reaching the island she said we left Rokh on the beach with his boat and climbed to the hilltop bungalow
There we found Affering dead in bed
He had succumbed to fever
Toward the last how ever he apparently had made desperate effort to gather up his loot and get away
How did you gather that asked
Because we saw all of the longburied money right there on the table
Septimus Cedar tried to explain away the lie he had told me about the return of the money
Disgusted refused to listen to his pro testations
As left the bungalow he took my arm to guide meit was darkand as he argued we moved along that jungle Dime Detective Magazine path toward the cliff
Suddenly saw the pit
This time there was no swing or rope in it
And felt my husbands grip tight en on my arm
He intended to kill me so that he could take the money with out it being known Soyou escaped Landren asked even ly of Alicia
Now please let us
Tins has been rather exhausting you know He directed weary smile first at Tem ple then at Arkles then at me
We re turned it with frigid stares
John Tem ples hand was still resting lightly on Ali cias shoulder
It must have told her that the new light she had thrown on the mat ter made no difference
Nor was Eve Marland less loyal to the man who called himself Landren
What flashed through my own lawyers mind was this there was really nothing on Landren even if we baited him into admitting he was Cedar
Cedar had mur dered no one
More and more it was clear that all we could hope for was to make Eve Mar land see that he was Cedar
Please take me home Leonard she said now
And Alicia beseeched her Please be convinced
was his wife
He cant look at me and deny it But Landren couldand did
Then he permitted Eve to draw him toward the door
Alicia followed still pro testing courageously
Very well she said
He is brazen enough to face me
But could he face the four wives of Affering That challenged them into stopping
Are you going to pull them out of hat came derisively from Landren
Alicia said in breathless rush to Eve Its test he cant face
dare him to try
mean dare him to look at me as was made up to deceive Affering Eves eyes were like saucers
Alicia said In trunk upstairs have all four of those costumes
My maid is there to help me make up
Hes afraid to she said tensely to Eve
She had guessed some ace in the hole
Hes afraid she challenged
Theres evidence in those four characters which he cannot face
And he knows it Her words fired our imaginations
And to Landren they gave no choice
If he withdrew now he would seem to retreat in poor order from new and vital evi dence
Lets see it through Eve he sighed
And we might as well make ourselves comfortable When he had induced Eve to sit down Alicia Carterall left us
We heard her run up the steps tb her room
CHAPTER FOUR The Seventh Cedar TN remarkably short time Alicia came down made up to represent the first of Afferings four wives
was disap pointed for the deception was not par ticularly effective
The San Diego woman had been described as blonde and Alicia had had no time to treat the blackness of her own hair
She had overcome that drawback par tially by concealing her hair under jaunty yatching cap
She wore white duck trousers and middy blouse and was smoking cigarette
Her lips and cheeks were redder and she had done something to her eyebrows
It would be fairer if we had moonlight she said
When she turned off all the lights ex cept one dim yellow globe in far comer the deception was slightly improved
Like manikin Alicia posed before Landren turning so that he saw each profile
Her hobby was boating you remember she reminded Landren
It was in this dress we saw her so we copied it Isnt that so The Seventh Cedar You know Landren said to Eve Im really beginning to believe shes sincere and that she has me confused with someone else My maid has the next costume ready and Ill be down again quickly Alicia said
Be patient please She hurried out and up die stairs
As we waited in the gloom spoke in an undertone to Temple
This is no part of your program It is not he said
And cant see her object Chilena Russian and Kanaka was thinking would be brunettes
Therefore Alicia herself brunette would be better fitted for those parts
With stage experience and maid to help her she could make quick changes
When Alicia appeared before us as the Chilena she was much more convincing
Over her head was crimson mantilla its fold pushed back just far enough to show her fine ebon hair
This hair was now centerparted
The ends of the man tilla hung forward over her shoulders
Her dress had laced bodice and short wide skirt and in this hands at hips she whirled like dervish before Landren
It was my scream she reminded him softly which helped most to deceive Affering
You remember how always screamed when you pushed me into the pit
Like this Alicia screamed earsplittingly
It was enough to curdle ones blood
If Landren lost color we couldnt blame him
For so did all of us
Then in flash Alicia was gone
TN little while Alicia appeared before us as the Shanghai Russian
This time she looked weirdly wicked
She wore long jade earrings
The slave bracelets on her wrists were coiled silver serpents and her slim figure was tightly gowned in anklelength satin
Her painted face
was dappled with round black spots
feather fan half hid it as she weaved sinuously in the gloom before Landren
Do you remember she challenged what time we had duplicating these She shook the twin bracelets before the eyes of Landren
That Shanghai girl had wheedled them out of Affering
Fail ing to duplicate them you posed as collector and actually bought the originals from the girl
Later as straggled in your grasp by the pit one of them came off and fell on the path
Seen there next day by Affering it was compelllngly con vincing Take me away Leonard Eve Mar land pleaded
She was clinging as loyally as ever to Landrens arm
But theres only one more model believe Landren said
So lets see it through
Would you mind getting done with it quickly
Miss Carterall shall get done with it quickly enough Alicia promised and left us
That last be tweenacts interval was solemn and silent
myself was anything but confident
Alicia had paraded in three characters without as far as could tell making any impression upon Landren
At last the fourth and final model ap peared before us
This time she was really convincing
Here as real as life seemed to be chocolateskinned Kanaka
was amazed that Alicia could have so transformed herself thus swiftly
Nor had she depended much on ornaments or properties of costume
Her dress was simple house frock
Her head and arms were bare
Bare and as brown as India
No won der we stared
The model posed for long minute before Landren then quite suddenly the lights came on
Instantly Landren was on his feet
One single word was shocked from him Kalanilu Dime Detective Magazine That is my name the model said
And the voice was not Alicias
Then the truth flashed
Instead of com ing down herself Alicia had sent her maid
And the maid not only looked like the Kanaka bride of Guy Affering but she was that very girl
Suddenly Alicia still dressed as the Shanghai vampire appeared beside her Kanaka maid
Septimus Cedar knows her name of course she said to Eve although have not mentioned it
Only for brief moment did the sur prise shatter Landrens defense
But it was long enough
Eve had seen his face in that moment and heard his one spoken word
He had given himself away
Expecting to see mere imitator sud den sight of the real article had proved too much for him
It had slipped his mask and could only marvel at the genius of the thrust
It far outshone any which had been offered by Temple
What fine foundation had been laid in the deliberate parade of three spurious char acters
Then when she had him smugly off guard Alicia had bowled him over with the real thing
ANDREN was trying to right himself with Eve
But Eve was backing away from him
She was disillusioned
That one peep behind the mask had been enough
Instantly she was through for ever with Landren
Gazing at him with growing horror she took the ring from her finger
When she held it toward him he de clined to take it
It fell with tinkle to the floor
When Landren stepped toward her arms futilely outstretched his own foot crushed it
Then Temples voice boomed decisively
Rokh please show Mr Cedar to the gate
Not merely to the door Rokh but to the gate Septimus Cedar turned on his heel and left the room
Rokh followed
They went out the front door and we heard it bang shut behind them
Then possibly half minute later thought heard some sort of cry out there
wasnt sure though
Those with me were too engrossed to hear anything at all
The maid had gone upstairs
Eve was crying while Bud Arkles vainly tried to comfort her
John Temple was speaking earnestly aside with Alicia
Lighting cigar puffed it thought fully
After while tried to join Temple and Alicia but there found three to be crowd
So strolled across the hall to the gunroom
Once more three made crowd for found Eve and Bud seated on bench the girl weeping on the boys shoulder
There seemed nothing for me to do but pace the hall and chew on another cigar
Half an hour later went out on the dark front porch
The sky was overcast not star or moon in sight
It was trying to storm
The atmosphere was depressingly sultry
Occasionally the horizon gave wink of lightning
In one of them glimpsed the six cedars
And thought saw Rokh engaged in seme odd chore to the right of the rightmost cedar
There was only the splitsecond glimpse of him
It exposed him with garden spade in the inexplicable act ef tossing shovelful of earth into newly dug hole
Rokh shouted but he did not answer
Perhaps thought was mis taken
It was as dark as Egypt again
Yet in few minutes there came another wink of storm light
This time was sure saw Rokh
He was at the same spot still to the right of the rightmost cedar and this time saw him patting down block of sod with his spade
When the dark girlstark horror in her eyeshanded Johnny Connell that cryptic note in the hotel lobby he never guessed it would be the
initial twist that would turn murder setup into OHNNY CONNELL had seen the dark girl once or twice about the hotel but he had never spoken to her didnt know her name
She had lovely mouth finely curved and dark eyes above it that were uncertain and anxious in pale young face
Now she seemed to be coming to him straight across the lobby smiling with the slightest trembling of her lips both hands outstretched to him
Jack Ballard she cried with the smile wavering desperately
How nice seeing you
When did you get in Johnny Connell was puzzled
Im sorry he said
There must She did not turn her head but her eyes moved quickly to the man at her shoulder and her palm gripping closer against lift Dime Detective Magazine Johnnys pushed square of paper into his hand
He stopped speaking and in the same instant the girl released him stepped back her laugh brittle forced
Im so sorry she said
Of course its mistake
You arent Jack Ballard at all are you
Do forgive me The tall dark man standing behind her had dead black hair worn long at the back almost like mane his mouth was narrow and wide under high brows arched over heavily lidded black eyes
He did not speak nor did the girl again but her strained features kept telling Johnny Con nell something
When he dropped his hand to his side with the paper still hid den in it he thought he detected sudden relief in her expression
Of course Johnny Connell said
He bowed the tall man bowed
The girl smiled brilliantly took her companions arm said Sorry again and moved away
Johnny Connell stared after them puz zled
When they vanished inside the ele vator cage he opened his palm glanced at the paper
It was heavy linen folded in quarters still damp from her touch
On the outside was written in womans hand To Mr Paul Aberdeen Folsotn Road North
Wont you take this over at once Nick
Frowning Johnny Connell turned it over and looked inside
There was more writing on the inner fold but he did not read that
After moment he put it in his pocket and crossed to the elevator
OHNNY left the cage at the ninth floor and turned down the corridor to the room he shared with Nick Mallory
Nick was blond young man with white teeth and nice grin he played the saxophone in the hotel orchestra from nine to one
When Johnny came into the room he was standing before the dresser mirror tying black bow around his wing collar
Hows the little Rock Mountain golf pro he asked cheerfully
Fine Johnny Connell said seriously giving him the note
just got this down stairs in the lobby
It must be for you Romeo
dark girl gave it to me just now the one saw you talking to last night The cheerfulness went out of Nicks face it twisted little under suddenly sullen eyes
He straightened out the ends of his tie got into his coat picked up the note and put it down again
He went half way to the door and then stopped
Johnny Connell said quietly It cant be as bad as all that
If you want to tell Papa Why not Nick said
His anile was crooked
Its an old story and you heard it before
Not that theres hell of lot to it Johnny
knew the girl when she was Diane Aberdeen she danced in night club back in New York while was in the house orchestra
Young love He waved his hand tried to grin
Soft music and stuff like that
guess Id been seeing too many movies
figured on marrying her when bankers kid turned upthis Noel French that died on her two months back
You know how it ends dont you Nick kept smiling broadly
She gives this millionaire boy the gate didnt have any money but what was that
She loved me and she gave up everything for me After moment he added tiredly Nuts
It wasnt movie
woke up one morn ing and saw it all in the papers
Theyd been married in Greenwich
So what He laughed with kind of leaden sound
Johnny Connell didnt say anything
Nick looked down at him repeated Im not sucker
was once and learned something from it
learned to stay clear
She tried to speak to me last night when you saw us but ducked her
You can forget them Johnnyany of them
Suicide Pact He stopped his eyes were suddenly dark and miserable
Whos this Aberdeen she wants the note to go to
Her father guess Nick said
Hazelher mothermarried twice
met Paul Aber deen the first one Dianes father
He and Hazel played secondclass vaudeville houses all their lives
The old lady raised up Diane as dancer took her around with them on their trips
She divorced Aberdeen two years ago and married some Spaniard Johnny Connell remembered the tall man in the lobby
His eyes grew thought ful and he moved one hand toward the note
What are you going to do with that
Nothing Nick Malloiy told him the darkness coming back into his eyes
Slip it into an envelope and give it to bellhop if you want She could have phoned him Suppose she couldnt Johnny said
Couldnt Nick stared at him
Whats to stop her
Cant you see what it is
This French is dead now and she has all the money shell ever need
She liked me once and when she sees me here she thinks itd be nice if we He turned with his eyes savage went over to the dresser poured out drink
Johnny Connell looked doubtful
He said Maybe youre wrong
Shes just kid Nickshe looked scared as hell Nick pulled his coat smooth over his shoulders and crossed to the door
He said with it half open The old army game
Youll wise up Johnny
did CK went out slamming the door and in moment Johnny Connell got up roamed absently over to the window
funny guy Nicktrying to kid himself trying to be hard when he wasnt really underneath
And the girl She had looked frightened no matter what Nick said
Johnny Connell wondered what had scared her
The buzzer sounded
Johnny Connell crossed the room and opened the door
The tall Spaniard who had been with the girl downstairs bowed in at him from the corridor
He had quiet slightly harsh voice while he spoke his heavily lidded eyes seemed fixed on Johnny Connells nose
He said Mrs
French is sorry about the mistake
She did not wish to trouble you
The resemblance unfortunately He shrugged and his thin lips drew in without looking much like smile
His right hand came out palm up
You will let me have the note now please Connell said dont understand The Spaniards lips contracted his hand moved fast
Johnny Connell was surprised at its grip
It fastened on his arm swung him easily to one side as it might child before he had time to brace himself
The Spaniard went past him into the room
Johnny left the door open and took three long steps
When he was before the Spaniard again his face was no longer pleasant
He said Get out of my room The Spaniard looked from under droop ing lids at Johnny almost quizzically without answering
Then he turned away saw the note on the table where Nick Mallory had dropped it
His hand had nearly closed on it when Johnny Connell hit him
He got to his feet slowly all the blood in his face gathered beneath the dark bruise just under his jaw
When Johnny Connell said again Get out his body twitched his chest moved deeply with out sound
The Spaniard moved unsteadily like drunkard back to the door
He kept watching Johnny Connell silently with his insane eyes until the panel of brown wood shut him off
When he had gone Johnny Connell Dime Detective Magazine rubbed his knuckles
Why would the girl send him up now to get the note
Ten minutes ago she hadnt wanted him to know anything about it Staring at the note Johnny could see her lovely mouth and the terrified look in her eyes
girl like that scaredand then this bird Johnny Connell swore
He took the note from the table grabbed light gray coat from the closet and went out to the hall
In the lobby he stopped just long enough to get directions from the night clerk for finding Folsom Road
AUGUST was the busy season for Rock Mountain
Outside the resort hotel village streets that would be de serted in winter were now crowded with groups of vacationists
Guitar music strummed faintly in from the lake over the lazy slap slap of oars far off girl laughed and the sound came to Johnny Connell thin tinkling
It set him think ing about Diane and he was thinking about her as he reached Folsom Road
There were no street lights but most of the houses were lit and he stopped his roadster at the sixth one ina threestory frame residence with square dark porch facing the road
His ring was answered by pleasantlooking woman with gray hair and plump face
Aberdeen she said
Im afraid he just left
If youd like to come in and wait Im sure hell be back shortly She smiled at him again and Johnny Connell went in followed her brisk feet up to the third landing
There was small space here barred off by walls of new plaster with doors on either side
The woman opened one on the left
There She snapped on wall light in the room watched him sit down patted her clean apron anxiously
Just make yourself comfortable
Mr Aberdeen al ways wants his guests brought up
Im sure he wont be long Johnny Connell put his hat on the table and looked around after she left him
It was sitting roan not large rather drab
There was grass rug on the floor some pieces of worn wicker furniture scattered around tall lamp at the farther side that wasnt Kt
The wall bulb threw weak glow over his chair but left the rest of the room shadowy and vague save for the dull glitter of brass smoking stand lying flat on the floor near the farther wall
Just under the edge of the stand there was womans shoe
It made Johnny Connell uneasy he didnt know why
He got up and took restless step staring at the shoe
One shoe
Where He turned and looked over the rug walked to one side so that he could see behind chair
The mate wasnt anyplace
There was thick reddish stain on the sharp edge of the heel
Johnny Connell began to feel intensely hot
He wondered what the hell was the matter with him
The quietness of course nerves
Anybody might have had nosebleed
Taking the smoking stand with him he went back to his chair and sat down
Five minutes went byten
Nothing at all happened
His eyes began to ache and he realized suddenly that he had been staring at the door on the far side of the room ever since his cigarette went out
The door was closed shadows were thick over it
If there was bathroom inside there where he could get some water His throat was parched
Aberdeen shouldnt care if He got up quickly and walked over opened the door
It was dark inside though not wholly so he could see pale curtains motionless at window the paler white splotch of bed
There was some thing on the bed
Johnny Connell stayed where he was in the doorway something inside his stomach cold and hard
The quietness was like Suicide Pact death
The thing on the bed didnt move
Even before he forced himself to go over to it Johnny Connell knew that it would never move
TTHE woman had her face down on the coverlet
She had black hair cropped close and below it on her neck thin strand of Cord was drawn tight into the puffed flesh
Her feet dangled over the edge of the bed and one shoe was missing
Her fingers were drawn up in fist on blanket folded at the foot of the bed
Johnny Connell touched it briefly went back to the sitting room with his face pale and hard
Just inside the door he heard steps on the outer stairs
While he stood there the corridor door opened and small man in white pants and blue coat came in
The small man stopped
Johnny Con nell said was asked to bring this note to you
Your daughter He had to clear his throat Youre Mr Aberdeen The small man came into the light
He blinked quickly furrowing the flesh of his forehead into ridges read the note and put it in his pocket his head bent slightly to one side so that he still looked up at Johnny Connell
Then he turned his eyes darting to the bedroom door and Johnny turning too saw that he had left it open behind him
The small mans face blurred and ran together
Words tears tumbled out brokenly his hands came up and pawed
didnt Before God Its plant kid
came home and she was there like you saw her
Gods truth He stuttered gasped his lips wobbled
Connell said Who killed her Aberdeen came close his eyes moving anxiously up and down over the others face
Im telling you kidGods truth
came home from the movies and there she is where you see her
The first tiling thought was to get train out of here
Then theyd find her tomorrow and if left like that everyone would think killed her
thought then could leave her on road somewhere so they wouldnt know where it happened Johnny Connell watched him
He asked after moment Dont you even know her
She couldnt get in here without being seen
Your landlady would have No no His words beat out feebly
asked Mrs Harris did anybody come
She didnt know because shed been over at her mothers and just got back
She just made the place over into apartments
Theres no bells yet for the different ones so she leaves the porch door open all the time
Tonight shes out and so am
Anybody couldve come up
Whod have seen them Then you dont know who she is Aberdeen hesitated shifting his eyes
After silence he admitted know her
Her names Esther Greenberg
Sheshe was nurse He raised his hands caught Johnny Connells lapels
You go see Diane
Tell her Miss Greenbergs dead the nurse that took care of Noel
Maybe shell Johnny Connell stared at him at the bedroom door then took his hat from the table
Ill see Diane he said
Dont go away TVHE clerk at the hotel gave him the number of Mrs Frenchs suite and he went up in the elevator and rang twice at the door of before it drew back
In the opening negligeed woman with face shiny from cold cream stared at him
The woman said Well Over her shoulder Johnny Connell saw Diane
Its all right mother the girl said slipping before her
Dont bother
Then the Spaniard was there too just behind her gripping her wrist
He said Dont go out Dime Detective Magazine Dianes mother looked at Johnny Con nell sharply
The gentleman can come in
That is if its No Diane tried to edge out
want to see him alone
Its important mother
Its about Nick Her small wrist twisted in the Spaniards hold and Johnny Con nell breathed hard
He took half step forward in the same instant that Diane got her arm free and came out to him dosing the door on her mothers protest ing voice
Nick couldnt bring the note he said
He was due on the floor at nine
took it over Oh She smiled faintly
thought Nickbut it doesnt matter awfully
It was nice of you It took long time for more words to come
He asked finally Did youdo you know girl named Esther Green berg Her eyes searched his frowning
Johnny Connell tried to dress it up and couldnt
There didnt seem any way
He said at last quietly Esther Greenbergs dead
Shedied tonight in your fathers apartment Her whole body was shaking
Johnny Connell gripped her elbows gently and said Its all right Diane
Dont worry about it
Nobody knows but your father Knows She rubbed one side of her face dazedly
But you dont understand
You know dont Johnny Connell said
came back to find out
want to help you Diane Three people got off the elevator in the center of the corridor walked up toward them and entered room ten feet away
When they had closed the door Johnny Connell said Dont be afraid
told you want to help you Diane
Just tell me what its all about
Why did you ask me to bring that note to your father to night
Couldnt you have gone yourself Her white face smiled desperately
Yes of course She raised her arm and the puffed part of her sleeve dropped back
Against her wrist Johnny Connell saw purplish marks
She made an aimless little gesture with her hand
Noel she said
Noel Her voice broke
Noel was killed too HTHE slow whisper died while he stared at her
Everybody thought it was pneumonia
You see Noel had had that once but hed recovered
Then last Sep tember he went out with Ramon to party and he came home drunk
The next morn ing he was sick again
hadnt slept in his roomnot for months
Wewe hadnt got along
When wanted to call doctor this time Ramon wouldnt let me
He said Noel would be all right
And then the next night went in late thought heard Noel call
He he had nothing over him but sheet and all the windows were open
got some blankets and put them over him and while was fixing the bed had to touch the sheets She shuddered her voice became so low that Johnny Connell could scarcely hear it
They were wet soaked through
Then Ramon came in
He said it was just night sweat and it meant that Noel was getting better
But it frightened me and called doctor when got back to my room
He came up in little while and went into Noels room with him but someone had changed the sheets then they were dry
The doctor said Noel was very sick and he had to have nurses all the time he sent one up that morning and Miss Greenberg relieved her the next night
thought that would make every thing safe but it didnt
went in to see Noel again about twelve that night and the same thing had happened
There werent any blankets and the bed was soaked just as if someone had poured ice Suicide Pact water over it
Noel was raving could hear Ramon and Miss Greenberg talking in the living room downstairs
Ramon had some bottles out on the table
think he was trying to get Miss Greetiberg drunk so she wouldnt know anything about it
made her go upstairs and change the bed
Ramon came with us and when he said it was night sweat Miss Greenberg looked at him queerly
Then in the morning he told me it must have been an accident and hed fired her for being careless
He made me give him five hundred dollars for the doctors he said
But think he gave it to Miss Greenberg so she wouldnt say anything
Two days later Noel died She began to sob quietly
And then he said if ever told anyone about it theyd say planned it to get Noels money
He said hed swear that he caught me once soaking the sheets
Id go to prison maybe the chair
No one would believe me Johnny Connell murmured something from between gray lips for the first time in his life he wanted to kill man
The girl went on dully was afraid
The only person told was father
Ive never done anything wanted even when was child
Mother decided everything never thought of questioning her Her lovely mouth quivered faintly she looked past Johnny Connell over his shoulder
When met Nick it was the same
Mother said he was no good that he had nothing that owed her every thing and should do what she wanted to pay her back little
She talked to me about marrying Noel all the time
Id be ungrateful if didnt hed be so good to me
And when told her wouldnt that II loved Nick she got sick she had bad heart
She said shed die Her strangled sobs seemed to rise in Johnny Connells own body
He patted her shoulder said softly But its all right now Diane
What was in the note Mother told me to cash some bonds Noel left
She said Ramon had informa tion that the company was going to crash and if didnt get the money soon theyd be valueless
The bank here arranged it this morning Ramon was to get the moneya hundred thousand dollarsand put it in safedeposit vault
But he didnt do thatI happened to see it in his traveling bag upstairs just before dinner
When asked him he lied to me he said he had put it in the vault
was afraid to say anything to him but thought if father knew he could tell me what to do
Father has no phone
thought Nick would take it over
When couldnt see him in the lobby gave the note to you Id seen you talking to Nick once and hoped youd know who it was for Johnny Connell took her arm
Im going to get your father
want you to wait in my room until get back The terror gathered again in her eyes
But cant
Ramon Ramons through
He wont bother you again
Ever TEN minutes later he stopped his road ster in Folsom Road
Without ring ing for the landlady he pushed back the unlocked porch doorthat part of Aber deens story was apparently truewent past it into the vestibule and up the stairs
The little man relaxed nervously mop ping his face when he saw who it was
Johnny Connell closed the door to the hall and said Ive seen Diane she told me what happened to her husband
She said you knew too Aberdeens tone was cautious
knew sure
Thats why Ramon tried to frame me dyou see
He was afraid Id talk and he wanted to get something on me so couldnt Johnny Connell frowned
Its not clear yet
Why should Esther Greenberg come Dime Detective Magaxii here
You had nothing to do with her Im telling you Aberdeen said
If open my mouth now about young French theres this to pin on me
Say this nurse knew about how he died and was blackmailing Ramon
He gets my address off letter write to Diane and then sends Esther Greenberg note to meet him here at eight oclock
just found it in her bag Aberdeen moved his shoulders
The landladys rooms are in the back and he knew she wouldnt see him if he didnt ring the bell
He warns the girl not to ring the bell but just to come up It began to fit in Johnny Connells head
If this nurse was blackmailing him he wanted to meet her here to pay her off
She had stiff price Aberdeen hundred thousand dollars hun The little man scuttled around the table his mouth twisting
What are you talking about
Where would he get that kind of money Johnny Connell told him
When he had finished Aberdeen said his voice shaking Hes robbing my girll knew it
Thats why He gripped Johnny Connells wrist feverishly
You see it dont you
My girl and young French werent getting along and this rat sees two million dollars slipping out from under his hand
So he kills young French and in smart enough way so no one suspects
Only this nurse knew and she bled him
Today she prob ably wanted the money all in lump and he gets it for her then he must have fig ured shed want more all the time and theres no sense in giving her this much
So he kills her and pins it on me He stopped breathing very fast crossed the room and vanished inside closet
When he came back he had revolver in his right hand with long clumsylook ing silencer attachment on the barrel
Aberdeen snarled trembling He cant get away with this
Not on Diane nor on me Johnny Connells hand stopped him
Wait minute
You cant cant Aberdeen said
He stepped away and the butt of the gun came up like flicker of gray light
Even as he threw his hand out Johnny Connell felt it strike his head whirl him down endlessly through darkness and dreadful quiet TTE CAME to on the grass rug in dark ness with dull wave of torture beat ing in the back of his head
The wall light above him had been extinguished and the door to the corridor was closed
After minute he pushed himself up to wobbly legs groped for the wall switch and found it
It was ten minutes to one by his watch
In his room at the hotel Diane was sit ting in the leather chair where he had left her
Her face whitened when she saw him and she came instantly to her feet
Diana moved to him with chocked sound
Youre hurt she breathed
Did father The door in the outer room closed
Under her arm Johnny Connell saw Nick cross to the table his cheeks hollowed out by tuneless whistle
He stopped sud denly as he reached it staring at her his eyes going once to Johnny Connell and then back
She said Hello Nick in voice that wasnt quite steady
Nicks face flushed he inclined his head faintly
When no one spoke again he didnt seem to know what to do with his hands he put them in his pocket took them out again said Hello without looking at her
His mouth comers twitched little in face he tried to keep composed
Johnny Connell couldnt think of any thing to say
He sat where he was star ing at Nick until the girl turned to him
Suicide Pact think Ill go now
Youve been awfully kind but mother may be worry ing
Its very late Thats all right Johnny Connell said
His throat was dry
Just wait few min utes more Diane
Out there
want Nick to help me clean up She hesitated
If you think its Johnny Connell nodded
Its very important
wont keep you long She went out without looking at Nick and sat down near the door
Nick came in at his nod and when he had closed the door behind him Johnny Connell said Shes in trouble
Her husband was killed
The nurse that took care of him tried to blackmail the Spaniard and she was strangled tonight in Aberdeens place
Shes still there Nick said What very loud the word bursting from him
Take it easy
Her father told me Ramon killed this nurse
According to him he sent her note to meet him at Aberdeens place while Aberdeen was out
But theres no way of checking his story maybe Aberdeens lying and killed her himself
dont know
was over there just now and he laid me out with the butt of gun
This Ramons got Diane fright ened he says hell swear she killed her husband if she doesnt do what he wants Nicks eyes glittered
He said Ill tear the louse apart
Where Johnny Connell said Dont be down
She never loved Noel French the mother made her marry him
Get out there and talk to her and stop acting like kid thats been stood in comer He went out first
Diane got up her young face strained and desperate trying to smile
think Id better go
Youve Johnny Connell said gravely Im go ing to ask you something very important
You said Ramon was with you all evening
Did he leave you at any time even for half hour after eight oclock Her brows wrinkled
Im quite sure
We had supper together and then went up to our suite
He was there in the room until you came Nick came out from behind him and went over to her
She tried to get off the chair but his arms on either side held her down
He said Youve got to listen to me Diane She said No
dont want to
Please let me They seemed to have forgotten Johnny Connell
He went out closing the door quietly behind him
TN THE corridor he turned right to the stair shaft and went down three flights
The door of was unlocked the sit ting room within was lit and the Span iard and Dianes mother were sitting on couch just before him
Facing them little Aberdeen was almost lost in the arms of morris chair
Johnny Connell walked across the rug and sat down next to Aberdeen
Ramons body shifted on the couch one arm drop ping inside his scarlet bathrobe
He said Let me Hazel his voice purring
The hand came out again with long narrow bladed stiletto balanced unevenly on his fingers
He was halfway to his feet when the woman said sharply We dont need that
can call the manager and have him put out
He cant come here without any reason She reached for the phone brought it to her
Johnny Connell said came up for reason
came up to talk about girl named Esther Greenberg She put the phone back carefully on the table as if it were made of thin glass
Esther Greenberg She repeated the name as if it surprised her
What hap pened
Whats he talking about When nobody answered shrillness crept into her voice
And wheres Diane
She went out with him two hours ago and she hasnt come back since
Its after one Dime Detective Magazine She wont come back Johnny Con nell said
Youre never going to bother her again Why youre crazy Hazel was screaming beating hand on her knee
Bother her
My own daughter Behind her Ramons breathing became audible in sharp sound that halted even the womans voice
His arms moved and the scarlet bathrobe dropped off them his head went little forward so that he stared at Johnny Connell from under his high brows and his right arm came up to his breast slowly with the knife blade glittering in steel flashes as he flexed his wrist from side to side
Aberdeen said something in croaking tone but the woman remained silent her palms pressed against the back of the couch one knee bent on the cushion supporting her body
This time she did not stop the Spaniard he came forward with his steps spaced and light
Johnny Connell got free of his chair
The instant that he waited seemed very long
The thick hate in him tensed his muscles made breathing difficult
He had his weight forward on his toes and when Ramon was quite close he shot his body in against the Spaniards his right arm swinging up in vicious arch his left flung out to the knife
Taking the punch high on the cheek Ramon went back with it but he did not lose his bal ance and as Johnny Connell lunged after him he stepped in fast knife hand mov ing soundlessly like flame
Johnny Connell got the wrist with his hand pivoted smashed in his right to the Spaniards stomach
Ramons breath burst out his white face contorted in an instant he was against Johnny Con nells chest body strained to body arms bent to arms
For moment they were motionless
Johnny Connell tried to tear his right hand free his lips drawn back with effort but the Spaniard held him steady forced him back step by step with the centered pres sure of his arms
Ramons face smoothed out he smiled again but the smile was drawn out thinned by the straining of his body
The knife came closer to Johnny Con nell very slowly in jerks that moved perhaps an inch at time
He could not hold it away not even when the wall was behind him with his elbow braced out ward from it like lever
He had no longer any feeling in his arms save dull torment beating high in his shoul ders
When he was flat against the wall with his right arm spread eagled on it by Ramons left the Spaniards face raised above him composed and cruel with no sound but the rapid whistling of his breath
CROSS his shoulder Johnny Con nell could see the woman still kneel ing on the couch her hand against the back her negligee drawn up by the curve of her body almost over her knees
One foot dangled out of its slipper on the other leg just under the knee patch of adhesive was whiter than her skin
Johnny Connell stared foolishly at it
Somehow little Aberdeen was in the picture behind Ramon trying to push him aside his voice making high mono tonous sound
Ramon did not look at him he kept smiling at Johnny Connell the wide harsh mouth drawn in against gold teeth until its edges were lost in the flesh
Johnny Connell braced his body desper ately tore his right hand from the Spani ards and swung it up in blow that had no force
He knew that
It surprised him to see Ramons stomach cave in as he struck as if metal bar had smashed it
The Spaniard went down to the floor his tall body twisting rolling over got to his knees with the knife still in his hand and began to crawl forward again shak Suicide Pact ing his head
Johnny Connell seemed to hear the first pop then
At the second Ramon went down flat sprawled out his body shuddering lit tle
He held fallen on his back and his eyes stared up at Aberdeen at the smoke that trailed thickly from the long barrel of the little mans silencer
His black eyes fixed on that motionless and un winking but not until the knife slid from his hand to the hardwood floor with metallic tinkle did Johnny Connell rea lize he was dead
Pressed back against the couch Hazel stared at them silently her crimson mouth extraordinarily vivid and alive in her face
Aberdeen looked down at the dead man with perspiration watering his lean cheeks the gun in his hand jerking
When Johnny Connell came out from the wall he turned and spoke to him in squeaking voice
had to Kid
Hed have killed youhe was crazy
slugged you back there because didnt know who you were
When you tried to take the gun off me thought he might have sent you He nodded down at the dead man
Johnny Connell took the gun away from him
Go over to your place
Wait there
Ill help you later with Esther Greenberg Hazel began to cry
The little man hesitated nervously at the door and John ny Connell waved the gun at him until he went out
Hazel moaned brokenly Oh my God
But Ramon deserved it
He killed the Greenberg girl because she knew about young French
She wanted money off him and he went over there and killed her
He He couldnt have killed her John ny Connell said
He was with Diane all night Then who She stopped crying on her flabby face tears dried
Who You Johnny Connell said in flat voice
It grew very quiet they stared at each other in silence across the dead man
Hazels face grayed but she said calmly enough as if she were arguing with him over something that didnt mat ter great deal Youre insane
Why would kill her
Theres nothing Theres your leg Johnny Connell told her pointing the gun at it
You gat behind Esther Greenberg and strangled her and while you were doing it she kicked backward and cut your shm
In the excitement you forgot to wipe your blood off her slippermaybe you didnt even notice you were cut until you got back here
found her shoe in Aberdeens apartment with blood on the heel but until saw the adhesive on your leg couldnt understand what it meant After that it was plain enough she did what anybody would do who was being choked from behind
Kicked back
The blood puz zled me because knew that she didnt bleed but if she didnt her killer must have His tone was tired unargumentqtive
Hazel answered him in tone she tried to make amused and only made loud and slightly breathless
Youre insane

Aberdeen and can get the Green berg girls body away
If they find it on road tomorrow theyll think she was here on vacation and somebody picked her up and robbed her
She was black mailing Ramon and you and probably didnt say anything to outsiders about it
So nobody knows why she really came PHERE was another silence longer
She made two attempts to speak be fore words came out
What are you going Of course this is absurd
You cant tell the police
Just because cut my leg Johnny Connell rose from the arm ofl Dime Detective Magazii his chair
Youve forgotten something
They can test the blood on the slipper and find out if its ycmrs No she said
You wontyou cant

Be cause Im Dianes mother Gose to him her gray eyes glittering she repeat ed Im Dianes mother
And you love that girlyoud do anything for her
Thats the only reason youd be doing all this just so she wont be implicated
Youre taking chance on murder charge yourself so shell be clear Johnny Connells face was stony she hesitated watching it went cm after moment If you charge me with the murder theyll find out why Esther Greenberg came here theyll find out how Noel died
And theyll blame Diane you wouldnt want that Her clenched fist pounded on his chest
So youve got to give me chance
Ill do what can to help youI swear that
Ill make Diane marry you even if She grew breathless and her voice became almost inaudible
She turned away from John ny Connells eyes
Dont look at me that way
Johnny Connell said hoarsely his throat strained We can get rid of Esther Greenberg but we cant take your hus band out of here
So theyll have to find you with him
Thats the outthe only out for Diane With him She pushed hand back dazedly through her hair
cant see what you mean
What am going to tell the police Nothing Johnny Connell said
She was watching him stupidly
You can leave note and say you killed him and yourself because you couldnt stand the pain
Diane said you had bad heart
The police wont question suicide pact Ilis
right arm moved and the gun sailed through the air bounced on the couch
Her head turned slowly to look at it stopped there as if she were paralyzed
Johnny Connell said Theres bullet left She sat down on the couch her face grotesque astounded as if she couldnt understand his words
Standing by the door with one hand on the knob he turned once more as her voice broke hoarsely after him
If dont If you dont Johnny Connell said theres Esther Greenbergs slipper
This way its better than the chair
Youve got an hour He returned from Aberdeens at half past two
In the lobby he put through phone call to Suite holding the receiver to his ear until the operator told him that there was no answer
He asked her to try again listened for thirty sec onds more then put the instrument back on its shelf with his gray eyes colourless and dull
Upstairs on the ninth floor Nick opened the door of the room and behind him Johnny Connell could see Diane sit ting by the window her face lovely and pointed against the night outside her dark eyes glowing
She looked very hap py she smiled at him briefly but even while she did her eyes kept following Nick
Johnny Connell told her that thered been an accident that her mother and Ramon
Breathless with hand outstretched gropingly to Nick she ran out of the room and when he was alone Johnny Connell grinned stiffly at the floor
In the quietness presently he got up and moved around but that didnt help any
He still felt tired and as if nothing would ever matter much again
Kicker Dell whirled
Then Zeph was upon him
INDIAN THICK by Maxwell Hawkins To the hardlooking pair who drove up in the big car that night Zeph Kingdom was just another hick to be used and gotten rid of
They couldnt have known that in his veins flowed pioneer bloodand that in his bead still lurked few pioneer tricks
HE last cracker barrel orator the last sawdustspitter had gone home
Zeph Kingdom who ran Kingdoms General Store at Potterstown was get ting ready to dose up for the night
He had just placed his hand on the oldfashioned bolt of the front doors when car drew up in front
Zeph bent his long frame slightly put his face close to the grimy glass and peered out
He could tell by the distance between the headlights and the ruddy glow of the taillight that it was big car
Beyond that he could make out little
The sound of the car door opening came to his ears
Then man moving with rapid dedsive steps emerged from the gloom
He caught sight of Zephs fig ure silhouetted against the lights of the store
We want some gasl In hurry Zeph nodded and opened the door
reckon can fix you up He walked across the store to the coun ter
He was tall and gaunt with slight Dime Detective Magi stoop to his shoulders although only little past forty
His hair was thinning at the top of his forehead but over his temples it grew in sandy tufts that gave him an odd appearance
His face like his body was long and solemn
But his slategray eyes at times held shrewd twinkle
For more than twenty years Zeph Kingdom had run the store
His father had run it before him
And before that Zephs grandfather who had come out from New York State with his Conestoga wagon loaded with meager stock of merchandise
tough customer that first Kingdom to settle in Potterstown
He set up his store in log cabin he traded and fought with the Indians by turn
And although Zeph wasnt conscious of it some of his doughty ancestors iron will and resource fulness had been passed along to him
When he returned with flashlight his midnight customer had stepped inside
He was young not more than twenty five or six
His dark suit flared at the lapels was pinched in at the waist but it covered tall broadshouldered body
His soft hat shielded his eyes and Zeph could see only the lower part of his face
He had glimpse of thick nose with wide nostrils mouth that looked almost lipless
Standing at one side the customer let Zeph go out the door first
He followed close behind
Fill her up he said
Shes almost dry Zeph put the nozzle of the gas hose into the tank at the rear of the big sedan
How far to Grider Lake the strang er asked
Eighteen miles
Two miles beyond the forest rangers tower Good roads No Zeph replied
Bad fWhat do you mean by that All dirt
Rough Road marked Zeph laughed briefly
Mister he said dryly youre in the back country
Theres few signs
If they havent fallen down The stranger nodded slowly
His tight mouth lifted little at one corner as he digested this information
As Zeph swung his flashlight to look at the gauge on his gasoline pump Zeph got quick view of the interior of the car
woman was sitting in the front seat
In the rear was second man
He had moved to the far side and was talking through the open door to the big fellow who had ordered the gas
The gauge showed twenty gallons
Zeph stepped to the back of the sedan and lifting the nozzle of the hose from the tank flashed his light inside
The tank was full almost to the brim
His sharp ears caught voice from the far side of the car
Hellits the only out moment later the big stranger reap peared moved close to Zephs side while he screwed the tank cap bade on
Zeph straightened up
put in twenty gallons he said
Thats threesixty His customers reply was to glide be hind Zeph jam hard object in the small of his back
Listen hide he said his voice low and threatening youre cornin alongto show us the way EPH knew what that hard object against his spine was
He felt too that the big man who was pressing it there wouldnt hesitate touse it
And this sudden turn of affairs not only took him by surprise but gave him decidedly uncomfortable feeling
He gulped
Youyou mean you want me toto go along to Grider Lake Indian Trick You got good ears the man with the gun sneered
Come on He prodded Zeph to the far side of the sedan where the door was open
Gimme that flash Zeph held out the light and it was seized from behind
The big man snapped it on turned the beam inside the sedan
Get in back
Make it fast The girl who had been sitting in front didnt say anything
But she crawled over the seat to the back of the car
She was young with white face and big frightened eyes
Her blond hair cut in long bob was topped by hat that tilted at rakish angle
Get in hick the man with the gun ordered
And if you let out sound
Ill plug you Zeph climbed into the seat the girl had vacated
His captor turned to the man in back
Hurry up Kicker and bring the stuff
Dont forget some candles The man called Kicker got out the oth er side of the car and entered the store
He returned presently with his arms load ed with canned goods which he placed in back
He made half dozen trips each time with an armful of supplies
On his last trip he carried couple of coils of clothesline
Then Kicker put out the lights closed the store door and took his seat directly behind Zeph
You make just one funny move he growled wamingly and Ill blow the back of your head off The big man who had been keeping watch over Zeph slipped behind the wheel
The heavy car started forward with smooth powerful purr
Which way Straight ahead for nigh onto mile It was no time to argue Zeph realized
These two men were dangerous deadly
The only thing he could do was guide them to Grider Lakeand hope for the best
He soon discovered that the best threatened to be pretty bad
few miles out of Potterstown and the big man stopped the car
All right
Tie him up Kicker bound Zephs hands
He tied his ankles too with the clothesline
Not tightly just so as to hobble him if he tried to run
Then the sedan moved for ward again
Zeph was trying to figure out the situ ation
The fact that his captors had looted his store of supplies indicated that they planned to stay somewhere in this Grider Lake wilderness for several days at least
They were hiding out he was cer tain now hiding out from the law
And the thought caused him to wet his lips nervously with the tip of his tongue
Think theyll trace us
Jack Kicker asked the man at the wheel at one point Not chance They may identify Buds body
Fig ure we might lay out up here The big Jack sneered
Four hundred miles away
Listen boy cops aint that smart
Im tellin you this is the spot
If what Bud said was true At least hed learned something Zeph decided
The girl was Babe the drivers name was Jack and the man behind with the gun trained on the back of his head was Kicker
Bud whoever he was was apparently dead four hundred miles away
The name struck respon sive chord in Zephs memory
RIDER LAKE which covered about three square miles was on low ground its shore on two sides merging into the swamps
On the other two sides the land was higher and dry
Here half dozen camp cottages had been built at widely spaced intervals
Now however in late October they were all closed
Even though the springs of the big sedan ironed out some of the roughness of the rutted dirt road it had taken Zeph Dime Detective Magazine and his captors almost an hoar to reach the lake
It was dismal sight Hie head lights illuminated
Thickets of alders willows and in the background funereal pines
Theres the lake Zeph said
Big Jack nodded indifferently
Lis ten hick he said do you know where the Chehnan farm is Instantly Zeph understood why the name Bud had sounded familiarly in his ears in connection with this trip to Grider Lake
Its about mile up this shore
Aint nobody there now though
Aint been since old man Chelman died
His boys in the pen he added
His boys in hell fella Kicker said dryly
That clinched it for Zeph
The Bud theyd referred to was Bud Chelman
And that accounted for the presence of these two men and their girl in the back country
Theres no one there Zeph repeated
The houses about falling down
No body wants to buy it We didnt come up here to buy Big Jack growled
Which way do we go to get there Youll find road leading off to the right about ten rods or so ahead It was barely discernible route they followed the wheel tracks were almost erased dried and matted weeds choked the center
The girl whined softly and Big Jack cursed her told her to shut up
She fell silent
They all were silent
At last the trees and shrubbery began to thin out
Suddenly the road emerged into large clearing
Directly ahead was the farmhouse
It was onestory structure small with peaked roof
The door was dosed
But on either side of the door were gap ing windows
They were dark now
Thats it Zeph said
Thats the Chehnan farmhouse
The property lines right here
To hell with the property line Big Jack snarled
It was plain that the eerie surroundings were putting his nerves on edge
He drove the sedan almost up to the door before he stopped
When he did he sat for moment contemplating the building
The paint was almost gone
Only few panes of glass were left in the two windows
What had once been stoop was rotted and leaning at crazy angle
Kicker spoke
What dump to drive four hundred miles for
Big Jack grumbled agreement
Wait here he muttered
He got out walked to the door and tried it
It was fastened but he pushed against it with his shoulder and it gave readily
He entered
They could see the ray of his flashlight as he went from room to room
In few minutes he came back to the car
Its hell of hideout he snarled
But we gotta make it do for few days
Till things cool off
Well get the hick parked first
Then we can lug the stuff in He opened the door alongside Zeph
Get out
he ordered
Zeph hobbled from his seat to the ground
Kicker got out too and he and Big Jack took Zeph into the house
It had four rooms
They put him in one of the back rooms which had once been the kitchen and Kicker tied the rope tightly about his ankles
Then they stretched him on the dirty floor near the wall
As they Heft he heard Kicker say Why bother with him
Lets get him out of the way now Naw Big Jade growled
got an idea
TEFGRE he had been ordered out of the car Zeph had noticed the clock Indian Trick on the dash
The hands stood at one fifteen
There was no moon but the sky was clear and the stars brilliant in the autumn sky gave cold feeble light
Looking up from the floor now Zeph could glimpse this chill radiance through the window above him
He heard his captors moving about in the front of the house
The mumbling of their voices fell upon his ears
door closed and then the footsteps ceased
The low rumble of conversation still continued punctuated occasionally by higher voice
The girl
Zeph tried his bonds
They had been expertly fastened and he soon decided it was waste of strength to strain against them
So he made himself as comfortable as he could on the hard floor and tried to think things out
What were these men and their blond girl fleeing from
He guessed it must have been some kind of robbery
And evidently Bud Chelman had been one of them
But Bud Chelman had been killed
They had planned to hide out up here and after young Chelmans death they hadnt been able to find it without help
That was why theyd forced Zeph along
But always the question burned through his brainwhat were they going to do with him
The man called Jack had said he had an idea
The way he had said it had been ominous
Zeph had spent all his life in Potterstown and the Grider Lake country
But he knew men knew human nature
He saw his captors clear ly for what they were
Gradually the sound of voices dimin ished
Then it ceased entirely
Zeph figured an hour must have passed before all grew still in the front room
Another hour passed he estimated
That would make it quarter past three
But at this time of year it wouldnt begin to grow light for several hours more
And then he became aware that door was opening
few seconds later the ancient rotten floorboards gave faint creak
Was it only his nerves beginning to play tricks on him
His doubt ended when low guarded whisper came to him
Where are you It was the yellowhaired girl
He swallowed quickly
His throat was dry and he didnt want his voice to boom out Herealmost under the window he said softly
There was silence then for long time
Once more the floor creaked faintly this time close behind him
Careful he whispered
Im right in front of you Her groping hands found him passed over his face and shoulders
She leaned close till he could feel her breath on his cheek
Im gonna help you mister
But for Gods sake you gotta help me too GAIN Zeph made sure of his voice before he replied
Then he whispered slowly Ill do anything can
But cant do anything tied up like this Ill bring knife
But do you know how to get away from here
On foot know every inch of this country Youll take me with you Yes II gotta get away Whats the matter She moved even closer
Listen mis ter
got mixed up with Jack before knew what he was
Down in Indiana
Then he wouldnt let me go Whywhy not know too much Whats he going to do then She began to breathe more rapidly
My God dont you understand
There was another girl before me
He got tired of her too
Nobodys ever found out what became of her Dime Detective Magazine Youyou mean mean he kilted her Her fingers dug into his arm
But that dpvil hasnt got me footed
He doesnt intend to take me away from here
Now do you under stand Zeph was aghast
reckon do Shh Once more he fdt her fingers pressing into his arm
They waited in silence silence heavy with menace of an unseen peril
He could fed her hand trembling
Hed heard nothing but evidently her ears had caught some warning sound
For long time they waited in the ghastly blackness
Nothing happened
II must have been mistaken she whispered nervously
They were both asleep when left She paused mo ment then went on Youre safefor little while
They think if things get hot and they have to make getaway through the woods theyll force you to guide them
Do you see
Yes But youll never leave them alive Whowho are they
Zeph asked
My God dont you know
Jack Kil lifer and Kicker Dell And in that second Zephs fears for his life crystalized into dead certainty
Jack Killifer wholesale murderer the bandit who always fired on sight Jack Killifer wanted in dozen states hunted by hundreds of law officers
Wed better hurry miss Zeph whis pered
Get that knife wanted to be suresure you would nt leave me she said
IU She got no further
dazzling white beam stabbed through the darkness
Like spotlight picking out the principals on stage its white circle revealed the kneeling girl the man stretched upon the dirty floor
You doublecrossing hellcat Killifers voice choked with rage
He strode across the room seized the girl by her hair and jerked her to her feet Then he began to shake her
Dontdont she screamed her voice rattling in her throat
Suddenly he ceased to shake her
Go ing to let him go were you he said more calmly
But his calmness seemed even more threatening than his anger
Honest wasnt
Jack She was crying now
felt sorry for him
only came in toto see if he wanted drink Youre lying The words came through set teeth
Again he grabbed her shoulder
He shoved her violently before him into the other room
The door was slammed
An instant later from beyond that closed portal her voice rang out in shrill agonized shriek of terror
As sud denly as it had broken out it stopped
There was moment of ghastly si lence followed by dull thud
FEW minutes later the door was opened again
From his place on the floor Zeph could see that the other room was lighted and he recalled that Big Jack had told Kicker to bring candles from the store
Zeph moved onto his side so he could see better
In the orange rectangle of the door towering black figure was out lined for moment
Then Jack Killifer flashlight in hand strode up to the man on the floor
He rolled Zeph over on his face and examined the clothesline bonds on his wrists then his ankles
Apparent ly satisfied he straightened up
Now maybe can get some sleep he growled and strode from the room
Zeph tried to picture what had hap pened behind that dosed door only few Indian Trick minutes before
With shudder he came to the conclusion that Killifer in his blind rage had strangled the girl with the yel low hair
That shriek of terror still echoed in Zephs ears
The girl had told him that he was in no immediate danger because these two killers hoped to use him as guide if it should became necessary to take to the woods
But he couldnt count on that
And he realized also that there was slim chance that the girl with the yellow hair had not been killed yet
If she was still alive something had to be done to save her
He pressed his teeth together until his jaws ached
His utter helpless ness was agonizing
He had to get rid of his bonds he told himself over and over
And he lay there on the floor his mind groping frantically for some possible means of accomplishing this
By pushing with his bound hands he finally managed to jerk up to sitting position
That was help
He could now look out the window with its broken panes
Not more than third of the glass was left
Gradually thoughtful smile crossed his long face
One eyebrow lifted almost imperceptibly he nodded slowly as if to confirm the idea that had flashed into his head
Inch by inch he wriggled to the wall to the window
By stretching he was just able to reach the sill
He hooked his chin over it
He pulled himself slowly up got his forehead onto the sill and gave quick push
He was on his feet
Leaning forward he examined the window as well as he could in the dim Hght
Then by rocking from heel to toe he moved across the short distance and backed up to the broken panes
He bent backward shoved out his bound wrists as far as possiMe
Finally he found what he neededa splinter of glass that still stuck in the frame
Slowly and painfully he began to saw the rope against it
He stopped often to listen
But no sound came from the front room
He cut himself again and again he could feel the warm blood on his palms
At last Zeph detected that the soft rope was yielding
moment later he had freed his hands
Swiftly he bent over and removed the bonds from his ankles
He stretched his cramped limbs to re store circulation wiped the blood away with his handkerchief
tiptoe Zeph crossed the kitchen to the door leading to the front room
He placed his ear close to the panel and listened
From beyond came faint snor ing mingled with heavy breathing
Zeph smiled to himself
His captors exhausted from their long drive were sleeping
It would be easy now for him to make his escape he realized
Yet he gave that scarcely passing thought
It was not in his nature to retreat when he had chance to capture the enemy
And there was the girl
Perhaps she was already beyond any help but until he was certain of her death he meant to use every means in his power to save her
He recrossed the kitchen slowly opened the back door
Outside he paused to look around for few seconds
It was grow ing lighter
Hed have to work fast
Circling the house at some distance he reached the big sedan parked at the front
Carefully he raised the hood that covered the powerful engine
In the deep shadow which enveloped it he could see nothing but his groping fingers found wire and he gave it jerk
One by one he removed half dozen sections of the ignition cable
Then he lowered the hood into place again
Retracing his steps Zeph passed the Dime Detective Magazine rear of the tumbledown farmhouse kept going
From time to time he hurled one of the pieces of wire into the underbrush
Temporarily at least he had blocked any swift dash for freedom by automobile
As soon as he had put considerable distance between himself and the house Zeph increased his pace
He headed down the narrow weedchoked lane by which they had arrived few hours earlier
Half mile down he angled off from the roadway into the underbrush
little farther and the trees and ground growth thinned out into small rocky clearing
Zeph smiled grimly
He hadnt forgot ten the lay of the land around Grider Lake
Briskly he set to work
The light was increasing rapidly as he set about gather ing pile of dried branches
When he had enough he stooped low and presently was fanning tiny blaze into life
He added fuel until he had sizable fire then made his way into the surrounding thickets and returned with an armful of green twigs
These he added to the flames
As the fire swiftly turned into heavy smudge he stood watching it for few moments
He nodded an expression of satisfaction on his lean face as the smoke climbed upward in the still air
From his pocket he took out his hand kerchief stained with blood from his lacerated wrists which he fastened to sapling near the smoky fire
Something else went with the handkerchief little later
And then he glided from the clear ing back into the woods and headed to ward the farmhouse where Killifer and Dell were sleeping
Concealed behind thick clump of un derbrush Zeph looked across the open field toward the dilapidated structure
It was daylight now and he could see the place plainly
There were no signs of life about it as yet
The killers must still be sleeping
EPH squatted on his heels
He was ready to watch and wait with the patience of the Indians who had once roamed this timbered wilderness
His first impulse on slipping his bonds had been to go for help
But if he went for help there was the possibility that either Killifer or Dell might wake up go into the kitchen dis cover he had escaped
In that case Zeph figured theyd lose no time making getaway
When they found their car had been put out of commission theyd probably take to the woods on foot
Zeph wasnt enough of woodsman to follow trail of that kind
Hardly anybody could
If Jack Killifer and Kicker Dell were to be captured and their murderous careers brought to an end he couldnt let them out of his sight
That was why Zeph squatted there in the underbrush that was why he fre quently turned and gazed with thoughtful eyes back toward the spot where he had built the fire
The sun climbed higher
Still there was no sign of life in the crumbling building across the clearing
The smoke from his fire no longer mounted toward the sky and Zeph estimated that he had been waiting there in the brush for couple of hours
He was about to shift his position and relieve his cramped muscles when sud den shrill cry broke upon the morning air
At the same instant figure burst from the front door of the farmhouse
It was the yellowhaired girl
She stumbled over the stoop started running across the open field toward the woods
And the huge Killifer was close behind her
Then she tripped sprawled forward with arms flung wide
Instantly Indian Trick Killifer was upon her
He yanked her upright
She screamed frenzied blood chilling sound filled with stark fear
Dont kill me
didnt help him get away
For Gods sake Jack Killifers fist cut off her frantic pleas
It caught her on the side of her head and again she went tumbling into the dirt and stubble of the field pitiful crumpled heap on the brown ground
Zeph started forward his eyes blazing with rage
But suddenly he halted glided swiftly behind concealing tree trunk
Kicker Dell pistol in hand had ap peared from the house and was standing on the stoop
He ran toward Killifer who was lifting the limp form of the yellow haired Babe
Wed better get the hell out of here Kicker cried
Yeah How about her Well take her along Killifer growl ed
aint done with her yet
You get our stuff together and Ill get the bus started Kicker Dell nodded turned and hurried back towards the farmhouse
Killifer carrying the unconscious girl made for the sedan
grim smile twisted Zephs mouth with clenched hands he backed into the woods until he was sure he could not be seen
Then he slipped through the brush as fast as he could go
circled the clearing till he was at the rear of the house
Casting caution aside he dashed to the back door
Noiselessly he stepped into the kitchen
The door to the front room was open and he saw Kicker Dell bend ing over suitcase which he was closing
His gun lay on the floor beside him
Slowly and silently Zeph eased for ward to the doorway into the front room
And as he stepped across the sill the ancient floorboards creaked
THICKER DELL straightened up and whirled in single movement
And then Zeph was upon him
tangled mass of arms and legs they crashed to the floor
Over and over the two men rolled
Kickers hand found Zephs face the fingers clutched for his eyes
But only for brief moment
Zeph twisted side ways brought his knee up and sent the cursing panting Kicker hurtling from him
Outside car door slammed
Zeph scrambled to his feet
Kicker was only on his knees when Zeph pounced upon him again
The tall mans arms shot around Kickers body beneath the armpits and before the killer realized what was happening he was pulled upright
As Killifer gun in each hand burst through the doorway Zeph had drawn Kicker close to him
Killifers guns came up but he hesitated
His pal was an un willing and cursing shield between those ugly weapons and their target
The big killers face turned livid with rage
His eyes became shot with blood and the nostrils of his thick nose quivered
Zeph Kingdom knew then that he was looking into the face of man gone mad with lust for blood
Killifers hands moved ever so slightly
There was deafening roar
Both guns vomited forth their lethal slugs
The im pact sent Zeph and his human shield stag gering backwards then to the floor
Without waiting to see the effect of his shots Killifer leaped out the doorway into the farmyard
Vaguely Zeph was conscious of shouts
And as his head cleared he realized that somebody was shootinga lot of people must be shooting
It sounded like battle
He dragged himself from beneath the limp figure he had been pressing to him even as he fell
In daze he stood up stared at his hands
They were red hideous bloody red
He looked down
In Dime Detective Magazine Kicker Dells stomach was great gaping hole
Zeph swayed dizzily
He ran the back of his hand across his face and it left gory streak
He took step and almost collapsed
And then he knew that one of the slugs that ripped into the body of Kicker Dell had passed on through into his own groin
With an effort Zeph reached the door way
There he paused supporting himself against the frame
He looked out into the farmyard
Fifty feet away was still figure stretched upon the ground the lifeless fingers clutching pair of guns
Several men were standing over him
They stared at Zeph for moment
One of them ran toward him and Zeph recog nized Ed Colvin the sheriff
Is he dead Zeph asked
The sheriff nodded
We blew him to hell
He wouldnt stop Zeph noticed with faint smile that one of the men was wearing the uniform of forest ranger
Theres girl in the car Zeph said
Youd better see how she is He limped out into the farmyard
The forest ranger and one of the other men hurried to him and took his arm
Ed Colvin ran to the sedan and jerked the door open
You got my note seethe one left in the bloody handkerchief Zeph said to the ranger
thought you would Ben Ben nodded The first thing saw this morning was lot of smoke over here near the lake
didnt lose any time in vestigating counted on that Zeph said
But there was chance you wouldnt see the handkerchief Not me Ben answered
And when read what youd writtenthat Killifer and Dell were hiding here and you were standing watch on emI phoned the sheriff from the tower
He brought his gang Just in time Zeph murmured
The sheriff came up
The girls Listen Zeph Ben asked suddenly what the dickens made you think of building that smudge You mean mysmoke signal Zeph asked with funny sort of smile
Sure reckon youll have to give old Grandpa Kingdom credit for that The sheriff looked puzzled
Why Zeph your grandpas been dead thirty years Yep
But when was kid he used to tell me about the Indians lot Zeph said softly
So guess just naturally thought of an Indian trick when needed one GUN ANGLES OUR APOLOCIESt We had all ready for you sheaf of redhot dope on certain much disputed points regarding guns and their use sent us by two of our authors who know what theyre talking about
But when the issue went to press so crammedfull was it of stories that there was no room for GUN ANGLES
We were confident that every one of the seven yarns in this issue was knockout and felt that youd rather have the stories than the department
So we left it outnot for good but until the next issue
Watch for it thenits mighty interesting stuffTHE EDITOR
