Living dead men
Emaci ated mortals without soul raised from graves by satanic power and driven to toil by the will of merciless tyrant for greed and power
Hokum says science
Death will not sell its heritage even to the devil
Drugs sus pended animation hypnotism of such things are Zombies
But have you ever seen Zombie
Many men have
Such men do not scoff they run for they sense the ungodliness of Zombie eyes the atmosphere of hell that permeates the presence of these things be yond the grave who neither talk nor eat nor bleed when torn apart
Corpses of Corruption Haiti Inner China eyewitness accounts by those who do not want to talk afraid of the demonic power which might reach out to fasten uncanny fangs on those who tell too much
Even starving rats and wolves of China shrink from these corpses of corruption nor will the snakes of Haiti strike at these walking things which defy poison
United States Marine lost in the swamp given up for dead by his comrades forced to seek refuge with natives preparing for Black Magic
He would have become human sacrifice to the Zombie god had he not at one time saved the life of wounded native
And now this native pleads for the white marine and he is allowed to see but never tell under penalty of what he knows would be worse than torture
But he has now spoken to one he can trust
The Zombie god will understand because this one in whom he has confided does not scoff nor seek to punish by man made laws
Unholy Discord The night is dark the wet mist of an eerie fog rises like the breath of hell from the stinking swamp where reptiles crawl and wait to devour insects which venture into the night
Tom toms accompany weird incantation of unholy discord as tiny lights appear on surrounding hillocks
Then stronger light looms up in the depths of the swamp fire before crude altar ready for the kill
The smaller lights of single torches begin to move like fire flies slowly converging on the altar fire until they are dimmed by the greater light and then go out
The assembly is ready
The Master giant native clothed in filthy shroud steps forward and stands before the altar
The black skin of his fiendish face smeared with rancid oil and blood shines in the firelight and his eyes gleam like pools of phosphorus
The incantations grow louder broken only by mumblings of demonic ritual
The Sacrifice scream
The sacrifice
young virgin her body writhing like captured python as it is carried to the altar by two naked blacks each holding leg and an arm of the victim
The sight of the altar and the fire is too much for the terrified girl
She swoons
Voices stop but the torn toms pound with increased fury
The great moment has arrived
Gently the quivering body is laid upon the bloodstained altar
The Master steps forward knife flashes and the body is still
The torn toms stop as though in si lent respect for the departing soul of this child of sacrifice
No sounds save the crackling of the fire and the noise of in sects
The Master withdraws his knife and raises his hands above his head
Instantly voices mumble and the torn toms once more begin their dirge of death
Sinister Operation Down again comes the knife this time slowly
The incantations continue
Then with the precision of surgeon the Master cuts into the breast of the girl
Slowly carefully he removes the heart
He drops the knife and takes the bleeding heart in the hollow of both his hands and holds it before him
All but the Master drop upon their faces in supplication
None sees what the Master does with the heart for when the natives come to their feet again the heart has dis appeared
Somewhere in the folds of that filthy shroud rests the cherished organ of girl who might have found love
But the ceremony is not over although the swamp is now quiet
The body of the girl is quickly removed
Authorities must never find it

Marked Grave ZOMBIE
Another Zombie for the Master
For days prior to this festival of evil grave has been marked grave where rests the body of strong man who died in the prime of life
He must live again and this time work for the Master
The unholy procession soon arrives at the designated grave
By this time the moon has risen
The Master halts
No words are spoken
only queer move ments of fingers and lips
The Master steps back
The men come forward
Crude shovels appear
And soon the wooden box which houses the corpse pronounced dead by white mans doctor is opened
Death looks up into the moonlight
It matters not if rigor mortis has stiffened the body or if putrefaction has brought stench beyond white mans endurance the corpse is lifted by strong arms and stood up on its feet in front of the Master
The Master then grasps the hand of the corpse and holds the body upright before him
Then the followers fall prostrate and watch no more
Only the Master speaks but his words are whisper
His other hand passes over the head and face of the man perhaps buried for weeks
There is sickening gurgle stronger than the rattle of death
And this sound comes not from the Master but from the thing before him
Zombie Is Born The Master still holds the hand of the corpse but not for long
The dead man is standing alone
His eyes open but in those eyes are no longer look of human intelligence
but vacant stare of soulless creature without consciousness or the breath of God
Another Zombie is born
compact with hell Deaths bargain for the virgin sacrificed to the devil
Who knows
dont believe it says the skeptic
It might have looked true but the man wasnt dead
He had been drugged by the socalled Master perhaps some strange drug known only to the witchdoctors of Haiti
This drug might have the power to suspend animation stop the heart and lungs sufficient to fool any doctor
Maybe the drug would soften the brain
And then when the Master dug him up days later another drug was administered and the man came back to life his mind blank
An imbecile not Zombie

mm Send this coupou ii address shown above Continued from page John who was employed by French planter
Says the Frenchman saw John die of pneumonia
He was pronounced dead by the doctor and before we could bury him rigor mortis had set in and his body turned green
saw him buried
Three weeks later my son said he saw John working in field back in the hills but John seemed deaf and dumb
In order to quiet my son investigated
The man looked like John even to the scar on his cheek and the pock mark on his nose
But John didnt know me
He seemed to look right through me with the expression of an imbecile
No it couldnt be John
John was in his grave
Of course it was possible for two men to look alike even to similar scars but this man didnt have Johns expression
dismissed the thought but my son was not convinced
He had heard too much about Zombies
So secured permission to open Johns grave
We dug
The grave was empty
But someone must have learned about my secret investigation for when we went to claim Johns body he was missing
The native owner knew nothing about him
He said we must have been dreaming or see ing ghost
And the skeptic replies Of course they were dreaming
Perhaps the grave was robbed by body snatchers who sold it to medical students for dissecting purposes
Strange Experience But how about the Japanese corporal who confidentially revealed his strange ex perience in Northern China to an English friend within the past year
Here is the story For many miles northwest of Peiping Japanese regiment had advanced finally nearing the objective not far from Mon golia
But before they could reach this point they had to pass through small mountain village situated in tiny valley
The road was narrow bounded by two hills which commanded the road
On the cliff like sides of these two hills were huge rocks ideal for machinegun nests which could mow down any soldiers entering the village
There were several of these nests and many Japanese soldiers had been killed
Finally the Japanese commander brought up his artillery and gave orders to blow those machinegun nests to bits
They were demobilized
Any Chinese gunners in them were buried under pile of rocks and debris
All but one
Heavy shells could not stop this gun which kept firing whenever any Japanese soldiers came into view
Something had to be done to silence that gun
Finally Japanese corporal with one man was ordered to climb the rear of the hill and try to sneak down on the Chinese gunner and destroy him
The whole regiment waited
An hour passed
Then the corporal and his man were seen crawling on their bellies down from the top of the hill
They had to be careful
The slope was steep
It was an intense moment
If the Chinese gunner saw them he would be able to swing his gun around and exter minate them with ease
But the gun kept shooting at the road below whenever Japanese soldier ap peared in the open
The Japanese pur posely coaxed the fire so the gunner would not notice the men creeping down behind him
Tense Moments It was not until the corporal was fifty feet away that he could barely see the Chinese gunner protected under heavy arch of rocks sitting at his gun which pointed through small opening
The corporal was afraid to hurl hand grenade for fear that the explosion might loosen the dirt beneath his own body and he and his man would slide to death
And it would be difficult to throw grenade in the small archway
Furthermore the gunner was so protected that even pistol shot would have to be too accurate
There wasnt enough of the body exposed to view
No the only way was to knife him or shoot him at close range
Suddenly as the corporal crawled closer small rock under him gave way
It rolled down the slope and bounced on the archway
The Japanese corporals heart almost stopped from fear
If the gunner heard it and looked around it would be sure death for the Japanese
But the gunner didnt budge
He seemed to be glued to the spot his eyes on the opening in front of him
Forty feet
thirty feet
They were upon him
Now to rush him
The corporal drew his gun and the private grabbed his trench knife in readiness
Both men jumped at the same time and inches away the corporal shot the Chinese in the back while the private plunged knife into the filthy neck
The gunner seemed to slump over his gun from the force of impact and the two Japanese satisfied they had killed him jumped to the top of the archway and shouted to their comrades
cry of victory went up from the troops below as they ran into the road in answer to the brave corporal
But something was wrong
The gun sup posed to be silenced began firing again and several Japanese soldiers dropped in the road below
The corporal infuriated dropped behind the archway and this time hurled hand grenade tearing head and arms from the Chinese gunner

torn APRIL Death Has Five Guesses What Frightening Force in Clintons Brain Wove the Scarlet Pattern of His Mysterious Fate
By ROBERT BLOCH Author of The Curse of the House Feast in the Abbey etc
THE real horror lay in the fact that Harry Clinton was just an ordinary college boy
He sported disreputable suede jacket the left underarm wellworn from the rubbing of the textbooks he carried
He was given to whistling popular song hits and he owned most of the latest swing phono graph recordings
He drove non descript car and worried about the price of gasoline
He played basket ball on the second team he liked ketchup on his hamburgers he oh well he was an ordinary college boy just one of thousands
And yet he knew grinning Fear
Harry Clinton had gone to West ern Tech for two years when Pro fessor Bairn began his experiments
Like the other students in Psychol ogy Clinton participated in the initial trials
It was just routine matter nothing more
Professor Bairn was interested in the Rhine Experiments the Duke University studies in extrasensory perception
He summarized his in tentions to the Psych
class briefly at the outset
The Rhine Experiments were an effort to determine the laws of Chance and their relation to human guesses
Youve heard of hunches and in tuition and telepathy Bairn told his STRANGE STORIES class the first day
Well heres your chance to find out what its all about
have here pack of twenty five playingcards
They are special cards five suits of five each
There are five stars five circles five squares five sets of wavy lines and five crosses
They are single black line figures on white background and these five were more or less chosen for their simplicity and their sym bolic association with ordinary con scious and subconscious images
Is that clear enough
Five sets of cards square circle cross star wavy lines
Ill pass these sets out and allow you to examine them
He did so and Harry Clinton looked at the little cards with the rest
Professor Bairn continued The basic idea in using these cards is simple
The operator holds one of them up to the subject with only the back visible
The subject closes his eyes allows his mind to become blank
Then he calls out the name of the first of the five sym bols to cross his consciousness
He may actually seem to see square or circle or star as the case may be
Perhaps the operator and the subject are seated back to back so that there is no possibility of facial expression or eye reflection on the part of the operator informing the subject or giving him hint
THE class exhibited tepid interest Clinton included
According to the experiments the score of correct guesses in most cases is five
This seems natural enough because if you were to go through the deck of twentyfive and call out star each time youd have to be right five times since there are five cards in each of the five suits
But and this is very large but in the course of these experiments it was discovered that some students were able to guess perhaps ten or twelve cards correctly
Upon repeat ing the tests over period of days many achieved scores of fifteen or even twenty
Certain people seemed peculiarly apt guessers
While the scores of others varied from high to low there were some who persist ently turned in the same or nearly the same high score
This has led to the setting upof theory of extrasensory perception an unknown quantity which may or may not account for certain peo ple having the knacks in making hunches or foreseeing the future or even for receiving telepathic com munications
Harry Clinton was thinking about betting on football games
Certain students submitted to months of testing
It was discovered then that odd effects on their scor ing ability could be brought about by getting them drunk or by testing them when they were fatigued or excited or stimulated
Some of them scored higher when told they were making progress others dropped woefully
It was ascertained that guessing ability has nothing to do apparently with the actual intelligence of per son
But and this is important the variance of reaction under differen tiated forms of stimuli implied that there was definite power affected Rhine has chosen to call this power the power of extrasensory percep tion
believe that Professor Rhine has shown the way to opening up new frontiers of the human mind
And with your permission should like to call upon few volunteers today
Clinton was one of the five chosen
He watched three others sit blind folded in chair while Professor Bairn held up the cards one by one and waited for them to call out symbol
He sorted the cards into piles of correct and incorrect guesses
Clinton noticed that the first sub ject girl guessed very swiftly
The second hesitated often
The third went quite fast for space slowed down and regained speed to ward the end
Clinton sat in the chair placed the warm blindfold over his eyes and began guessing
Square circle circle star square curly line star cross cross curly line cross no thats square now cross circle DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES He felt queer
It was hardly his own voice droning
It was hardly his brain that saw in the darkness the rapid flickering images of circles and squares and stars and curly lines and crosses
Something directed him made him speak
He completed the test in fortytwo seconds
BAIM said nothing
He discoursed on individual peculiarities men tioned how some guessers were fast others slow others erratic
He also intimated that memory that is the knowledge that one had already called star five times and conse quently would not call it again dur ing the same testing might subcon sciously influence the guessing
real definitive score he said can be obtained only after seven consecutive tests
Ah Mr Clinton would you care to go through the pack again six times for the benefit of the class
Clinton agreed sat down in the chair again
The images came swiftly
The period bell rang as the tests were concluded and the students trooped out
Bairns bulky figure leaned close as Clinton rcse and removed his ban dages
Mr Clinton Id like to have word with you
Yes Professor
Mr Clinton should very much appreciate your working with me this semester on these tests
Your initial scores might say are ah remarkably high
This might be fluke an accident but any extraor dinary ability should be cultivated
Of course this will be credited to your regular work you know
Why sure
Why not
Say what is my average anyway
Twentythree Mr Clinton
An amazing twentythree
Clinton worked with Professor Bairn for months
The experiments broadened in their technique
New methods were employed
One night Baim called Clinton on the phone and requested him to guess the cards over the wire
They worked in sep arate rooms for several days worked with screens between them worked in total darkness conducted the tests with telegraph keys and called the guesses in French and German
It made no difference Clinton showed his remarkable aptitude throughout
At first for Clinton it was lark
Then it became problem to wonder over
After time it reached the stage of competition battle of wits against the Unknown
And finally during the third month it was drudgery
Baim was writing monograph on his work with Clinton
Although the professor endeavored to repress his enthusiasm Clinton knew that he was highly pleased with the venture
The extraclassroom nature of the studies kept Clinton very busy
Bairns demands on his time and his insistence on undertaking tests at odd hours and under odder circum stances began after while to annoy him
There were days when Clinton went through the deck thirty times running
He grew sick of the sym bols exasperated
Even the surpris ingly high percentage of totally cor rect scores no longer seemed worthy goal to him
Despite all the work he understood no more of his unusual power or ability than he had at the beginning
He merely closed his eyes and the pictures came the five symbols loomed up almost au tomatically
He tried guessing ordinary play ing cards and failed miserably
He lost two dollars on the home team in football game
He had no luck in guessing examination questions
Undoubtedly this peculiar sixth sense was uncontrollable
By the conclusion of the third month it was worse than that
He left his daily tests with headaches
He began to experience periods of moody irritability
Moreover he had tendency to forget trifles and de tails
sort of mild amnesia seemed to steal over him at times so that he was unable to account for his actions for halfhours at time
Usually after his testing periods he would have difficulty in concen STRANGE STORIES trating on anything else for quite while
The symbols stuck with him and closing his eyes he would invol untarily conjure up images of crosses and stars and curly lines and squares and circles
They floated in his head and when he opened his eyes again an hour had passed some how
This got worse
Clinton told no one for he himself did not quite know what was the matter
But in the middle of May he suddenly ex perienced an attack of amnesia which lasted for three days
IT WAS so hard to think
Harry Clinton that was his name had gone into room and now his hands were around some thing soft
He had done many things in the past three days and somehow he couldnt think just what they were
Or rather part of him didnt want to remember what they were
They had been bad things
Was he at home in the rooming house in his own bed
Was this all nightmare
No it was real
He was standing with his hands around something soft and three days had passed
Three days of school of study of work
Why couldnt he remember them
It was even hard to see
He felt as though his eyes were closed as though he was taking the tests guessing at the brightlycolored mental pictures of crosses stars curly lines squares and circles
That was why he couldnt remem ber
It had something to do with the tests and the way they had af fected him lately
He must think back now
For week or so he had been taking forty turns through the deck day
Pro fessor Baim had asked him to as final experiment to be written up for his almost completed monograph
Each days testing had left him with terrific headache
More than that he had been un able lately to shake off the recur ring visions of the five symbols
He would leave the college and one or more of the symbols would come and stay in his brain
He would fall asleep thinking of the cross and awake with the same thought static in his mind
That had caused his memory lapse
But where was he now
He stared down again at his hands and gasped as mists cleared
He Harry Clinton remembered
He remembered that first evening when he had thought he was going to be sick and had stepped into the alley
He had leaned over the refuse box as consciousness dissolved into swirling mist
But now he could recall what happened
He had leaned over the refuse box had gazed into it and seen what lay at the bottom
Two broken sticks lay there probably torn from some packingcrate
They lay there one atop the other and they had formed cross
Clinton had picked them up that is his hands had done so
Clinton himself did not exist
There were only hands and something guiding them which was not Clinton or Clintons brain some alien force that felt drawn to the symbol of the cross
The hands picked up the sticks fumbled about in the trash box for length of wire bound the sticks into permanent crucifix shape
Then Clintons body had walked down the narrow alley and Clintons eyes had kept looking at the base of the cross where the stick was broken and ended in jagged point
Clintons eyes had gloated
But Clinton himself had hated what he was doing because he did not understand and hated the other part of consciousness which drove him to fashion symbol he wished to forget so that as he walked he grew very angry
Every time he closed his eyes the cross was there in his forehead
It was burning up there just the way it did when Clinton guessed the cards at school
Only there were no cards this time and still the cross remained
The memory was haunt ing him making him do absurd DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES things like fashioning this wooden crucifix with the pointed end
If only Clinton could forget the cross
He closed his eyes quite tightly lurching down the alley wishing that the two crossed iron bars against his brain would go away
He must not see the cross Clinton opened his eyes and saw the man coming down the alley from the opposite direction
It was dark but the moon was up and he saw that the man wore black skirts
For moment he feared he was delirious and then he realized the truth
It was priest
Coming near he saw the moonlight pick out glittering pattern on the priests chest
glit tering pattern of cross
The golden cross dangled it swayed from side to side as the priest walked
The moon was cruelly bright so that its rays made of the crucifix blinding blur
Clinton looked and could not tear his eyes away
But he wanted to he wanted to with all his soul
He did not want to do what he And then Clinton stepped over to the priest just as he passed and from behind his back he drew the wooden crucifix with the pointed end and drove the point straight into the priests chest
He walked away his empty hands clutching at the air with sort of joy born of the fact that they were empty they no longer held the cross
There was joy in his mind too for it was empty of the symbol which when normal he so deeply respected but which in his dream like state of abnormality obsessed him
No cross now only that tin gling emptiness his whole brain was empty and free
Harry Clinton went home and slept slept gratefully without dreams
For he was empty and when he awoke he had forgotten the night before with the cross and the priest
In the class the next day when the cards were called Clinton scored only seven
Two squares had come two circles one curly line and two stars
But no cross
Never during the entire test had he called out cross or thought of one
There were times when his eyes closed he had almost consciously tried to conjure up the vision of the cross in his mind
He had failed
He knew that there were five cross marks in the pack of twentyfive and yet in honesty he could not call aloud an image that he did not see
This Clinton now remembered
HE remembered the following day the day he guessed the five stars correctly
It was the day of the astronomy lecture too
Had that affected him
He wondered
He had called the five stars cor rectly
After leaving class the head ache had come

and EX LAX THE ORIGINAL CHOCOLATED LAXATIVE At all druggists STRANGE STORIES He walked through the cool streets of dusk his feet moving automati cally along unbidden paths
Thoughts refused to come
He stopped in at drug store and bought some as pirin then meandered along the streets again
He had not wanted to go to his room
He caught himself straining to hear the sound of cars passing the conversation of others in the street
For some reason he was particularly anxious to be amidst noise and lights and people any thing that might arrest his attention and ease the ache in his temples the ache that was all dull nothing ness in which bright star blazed
Erratic footsteps followed his gre garious urge until he was moving along downtown
The welcome clangor of streetcars began to fade and only constant blinking enabled him to keep his eyes open
Abnor mal nictation seemed the sole salva tion at the moment when now even sounds failed to hold his attention
GRATEFULLY he had entered the vaudeville theater sunk into loge seat and willed himself to watch the final reels of the motion picture flashing across the screen
At the conclusion he experienced nasty shock when the trademark of the producing company flickered into view with its crest of five stars
The theater was nearly deserted at sup perhour and in the darkness Harry Clinton fought losing battle with the fivepointed image that thrust itself again and again between his inner eyes and his outer vision of the screen
The brassy orchestra heralded the stage show and for few minutes Clinton again knew peace
But the star act Clinton had winced when the master of ceremo nies announced the turn as such was the personal appearance of movie queen
The whole thing was madness
Movie star she swept onto the stage against background of glittering silverfoil star
Garishly lighted the five silver points gleamed painfully and Clinton could not move his eyes away
The image mocked him and the blonde girl before it undulating about the stage in sequins seemed part of the star itself
Clinton bit his hand to keep from screaming
His mind groped for thought any thought to hold his attention to swerve it from the thought which en gulfed him
And in the darkness he lost
He rose to his feet and started down the aisle before the act was over
No longer was he conscious aware of thought or action
He passed the boxes and entered the passageway which led backstage
Some part of him was moving slowly cautiously
All he saw was great glittering star star which was em blazoned on his mind and which ob truded between any other image and reality
He must get rid of the star in his mind
Cautiously he moved along the de serted backstage corridor
The act was over the hallway momentarily deserted
He walked slowly down toward the door under the light paused before it
There was gold star on the door of the dressingroom
Its five points were sawteeth biting into his brain
He stared at it then pushed the door open
The blond girl was sitting at her dressingtable eating
Clinton did not see her
He saw star
There was heavy bluntended mirror on the table
There was large sturdy walkingstick in the corner
Clinton did not see them
He saw stageproperty artificial mace in wallstand
Its head was studded with fivepoints
Clinton ignored the other weapons
Walking slowly he seized the mace as the door closed behind him
The girl turned around
Clinton saw the star burn brighter
She rose said something
Clinton saw the star move closer
It was close enough to reach now
Some part of him held the mace
And then dream fused with reality as he brought the mace down
One two three four five times each time point fell away from the core of torment in his brain
Then there was only blur DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES that became red red as the pool on the floor where something lay
Clinton turned opened the door walked out back through the passage and resumed his seat in the theater
He must have fallen asleep for when he awoke the last show was over and the houselights were going up
He did not remember how he had come to this place or what he had done here
And he did not think about stars
The next day in class he had re fused to take the test telling Pro fessor Bairn that he was indisposed
At the time he did not know any reason for doing so except that he felt vaguely tired and incapable of effort
He asked to be excused early and went home
He did not even read the papers had he done so he might have seen the accounts of the mys terious death of Father Pornelski who had been murdered by an un known religious fanatic two days before
He could have read of second murder which was already making national headlines the strange death of wellknown mo tion picture actress
HARRY CLINTON was oblivious to all he only knew that he felt tired and quite unaccountably he did not wish to continue with the extrasensory perception experiments
They had given him these recent headaches and peculiar lapses of memory he felt sure
Today he was glad that his mind was free
Once in his room he lay back in the win dowless gray and almost revelled in the blankness of his brain
Funny since taking up these psych experiments hed thought hell of lot about his own mind
Before that he had never even known he had one
Oh well
It was pleas ant and soothing here
Closing his eyes he watched the two dancing lines of parallel curlicues two gray curly lines wriggling before his naked brain
Two curly lines
What did they remind him of
Of course Sally
Sallys curly hair
He sure was forgetful these days why he hadnt seen Sally for over week
Mrs Johnson the land lady had left note under his door three days ago saying that Sally had called the night he was out some where walking off his headache
The poor kid she was worrying about him
Why had he neglected her that way
OW that he thought of it thought of gray lines he could not stop
This psych stuff was sure de veloping his concentration all right
It seemed as though he just had to go and see Sally
She would be home now Thursday afternoon
Her biology lab
period was over at eleven on Thursdays
He must drop in and surprise her
He had to sur prise Sally
Sally with the curly yellow hair
Two curls in back
Long golden curls
Oldfashioned girl
He was already walking down the street turning up
light misty rain was falling and glancing into the street Clinton noticed the tread markings caused by the tires of skidding car
They left two curly lines
He was going to see Sally
One block more
The curly lines
They got mixed up with his thoughts of Sally
Two golden caterpillars on her neck
On her white neck
Two curly lines
Ring the bell
No one in
Open the door her room is in front
Curly fringes on the carpet be neath his feet
Curly fingers knock ing on the door
Curly lines of two red lips to kiss
Oh Harry where have you been
Ive worried so Curls
On her neck
Think about Sally not the curls
What are you staring at
You look funny
Must feel the curls
Dont want to but must
Cant think until they are felt
Cant think at all
It was only after touching the curls that Harry Clinton did begin to think
It was then that he re membered everything the death of the priest and the star and the ob sessive mingling of Sally and the STRANGE STORIES curly lines
Clinton thought of all these things because he had been shocked into doing so shocked by gazing down at his own hands clutch ing Sallys curls
Sallys curls which his hands had wound about her neck and tightly pressed to strangle her to death
Clinton knew then
Even as he ran through the streets he knew
He could think only too clearly now
He was in the grip of some obsession concerning the five symbols on the extrasensory perception cards
The strain of guessing those symbols with closed eyes day after day for months in variety of experiments his facility in conjuring up the proper mental images these things had induced some abnormal condi tion whereby one or more of the symbols now came to his mind with out conscious effort to recall any
It was sheer habit to think of star cross curly line square or circle
Telepathy what was it
What peculiar force in the brain aided him in his guessing
Was it psychic power or an alien intelligence prompting him
Whatever the cause the matter had passed all controllable bounds
He was helpless to fend off the power of the symbols for symbols they had become
When preyed upon by the recur ring image of the cross he had en countered the priest and some part of his brain had identified the holy man with the cause of his torment
He had killed the priest to erase from his mind the cross symbol
And had not instinct guided him to choose symbolic weapon
In the vaudeville theater he had seen the star
Out of several weap ons in her dressingroom he was prompted by the symbolism of the macehead
Was he actually guilty of such crimes
Or was he dual person ality
Some subconscious murdering impulse had guided him very cun ningly in the execution of his kill ings
Was he insane
He must have been to kill Sally
Good God he had killed her
That was why he was running
No one had seen him
Her curly hair two curly lines on her neck writhing through his brain he was forced to erase the crawling curly lines from memorj
Symbolically he did so with her death
That was another thing
He had not taken the test
Merely thinking of Sally this last time had caused identification
And there was still the circle and the square to go
Would he murder two images of transference because of them
He panted with exhaustion lying on the bed in his room
Would he murder two more
What could he do to prevent it
HAD to drop psych
That was cer tain
And keep from anything which might even vaguely be asso ciated with the last two symbols
He could not he fancied play poker any more with the three boys down the hall
They sat at square table and there were four of them
It might suggest the square
Or the chips might suggest the circle
fat man could evoke the circle image
Or even the phrase square shooter applied to some man was liable to set him off
Yet he needed squareshooter
He had to tell someone about this
That was the way they did it in psychiatry wasnt it
The old idea of the confessional
Whom could he trust
Whom could he tell
He would state the case hypothetically of course and get the dope straight
But whom
Professor Bairn
Yes Bairn was the logical man
He knew about all this
Clinton would have to see him to drop the class anyway
And per haps Bairn knew of way out
There had to be way out at once
Murders could not continue
He was going crazy
It was all insane and at any minute the torturing images might recur to blot out all thought and sanity
Why not go now
Clinton rose and walked swiftly out of the room out of the house down the street to the Campus Square
DEATH HAS FIVE GUESSES It was four oclock
He had murdered Sally at two thirty
It was an absurd thought
An hour and half ago he had mur dered woman
Now he was going to what was he going to do
Oh yes see Bairn
Good old Bairn
He would know way to help
His classes were over hed be working in his office
The wide office door loomed before him
It was very wide
Almost square
Clinton walked in
Bairn was sit ting at the desk his square shoul ders hunched over Oh no
Mustnt think of squares
Hello Professor
Dont think about the square jaw
wanted to talk to you
Think of something else quick
Whats he doing
Oh yes he has the cards out on the desk
Why the cards are square
Your cards are square Profes sor
HAT was he saying
The cards are square
Professor Bairns cards are square
Professor Bairn taught me to think of squares
Pro fessor Bairn will play square with me
Professor Bairn is square
Whats the matter
Dont be afraid Professor
Professor Square no Bairn hes afraid
Hes backing away
What do look like
What am doing
Hes backing up to the window
The window think of the window for Gods sake think of anything but Professor Bairn is square
Think of the window
The window is square
Bairn is backed against the open square window
Square against square
Square accounts
Professor Hes falling
Twisting around
Twisting why he isnt square any more
Hes all crumpled
That was easy
Its gone
Now to get rid of that damned circle
Clinton was almost happy as he slipped out the side entrance
He walked slowly back to the room inghouse even listened to the news boy on the corner of Hale and Jef ferson shouting about the Extra
Reedalla bouta moider
Collichgoil foundead
He didnt buy paper
He knew all about the murder
He knew all about lots of murders
But what worried him was that he didnt know about the next murder
There had to be one
There sim ply had to be one
He must get rid of the circle
Then hed be all right again
Somehow he realized that these things were not right but it was all necessary
man couldnt live when his brain was on fire with incomprehensible images
This pe culiar power of his this psychic power of guessing correctly it was somehow alien and evil
Poor old Bairn had he actually realized the full extent of the forces he had tampered with
There was certainly lot to it he hadnt sus pected
Must have had his suspicions though when he went out the win dow
Perhaps he knew now
This stuff was all from across the Border
Clinton didnt know and couldnt control it
Funny idea
Suppose this was really some extra sensory perception of his this guessing faculty hed developed
Suppose it were and that it was not meant for men
Something or some one might guard it
Or per haps this faculty merely opened up new part of the mind in such way that the old mind was unable to govern or control the actions of its augmented self
There was dark stuff here and Clinton didnt want to tamper with it
Do the murder get rid of the last image forget about it all erase the circle and be free
Whom to sacriSce
The moonfaced husband of Mrs Johnson the landlady
Rogers the kid with the shaved head and the round skull
The circle is the symbol of in finity eternity
All life is circle
Curved space
Curved existence
Round and black
Up the stairs around to the room
STRANGE STORIES Think deliberately of the circle so that it may provide key to the way out
Release the brain
This would be planned deliber ate murder
Why not
There was gun in the drawer
Clinton took out the gun filled it with round cartridges gazed down the round hole in the muzzle
He was trying hard to think of the person he meant to kill and strangely no thought came although by this time he could see the circle quite plainly in his mind and for the first time he actually rejoiced in the pain
The blazing circle coruscated swirling round and round and round as he looked down the dark round muzzle of the gun
It was then that he heard the sounds from below and the tramp of footsteps on the stairs
Sluggishly he realized the truth
They were coming for him
After all four murders he was in daze must have left many clues
They were coming for him now
But they couldnt come
They couldnt lock him up now
Not now when the circle was squeezing tightly around his brain
He must get rid of the circle first find peace
Be cause they would shut him away for the rest of his life in madhouse and he couldnt stand it there with nothing but the thought of the cir cle
They were coming up the stairs
Clinton rose and stepped forward wildly gun in hand
The circle of his room
Something bright arrested his at tention
Something bright and round like the circle in his head
He tried to see it
He could see it
It was the mirror the silver cir cle of the mirror over his bureau
He stared into it
In the silver circle he saw himself his own round head
The knocking on the door came
But Clinton stared into the silver circle at his own round head
Clin ton stared into the dark circle of the gunmuzzle
He put the round muz zle to his round head and looked into the round mirror as though for confirmation
Yes it was right
Open in the name of the law
He had found the fifth symbol
It was the circle of life back to him self
He was the last symbol
Once he erased that he could find peace
Harry Clinton sent circular bul let into his circular brain
Whatever the source of his extra sensory perception he had guessed right at the end

All LL right here we are said Major Crosby halting
He glanced briefly at the four men who formed his body guard and then turned to young Henley
Now Henley he said dont want any interruption from you
Im going to handle this thing myself understand
You know how much influence these native witchdoctors have and its no go angering them needlessly
And Logodas bad one he and his filthy heads
Henley flushed beneath his bronze
One of those heads may be all thats left of my brother he said shortly
Logoda knows too much to bother an Englishman returned the major
My brotjier knew his magic
He knew too much of his magic said Henley staring through the bushes toward the squat hut of the witch doctor Logoda
Well for Gods sake dont start anything
The major started forward but Henley caught his arm
Wait Major he said
What is it
Crosby snapped
Talk to him in his own language said Henley
STRANGE STORIES havent mastered the native tongue yet returned the major crossly
didnt mean that said Henley significantly
Oh said the major startled for moment
Then he shook his head moodily and strode on across the clearing with Henley at his heels
few natives scattered warily as they came on leaving the door to Logodas hut clear
There was col lection of trophies about the en trance some of them were not pleas ant to look at
Major Crosby reflected briefly upon Englands inability to stamp out certain practises
Then he turned and curtly ordered his men to stay outside
Major Crosby lifted the matted doorway and went inside followed by Henley
It took them minute to get used to the darkness
Then they saw Logoda and the ugly stained heads dried and strung along on poles above the witchdoctors head
Major Crosby had been in the hut once before not so very long ago
There were ten heads then now there were eleven
The additional one in the light of Bob Henleys dis appearance made him uneasy
LOGODA an ungainly hulking man sat on his haunches in cor ner
He wore an odd headdress ap parently hastily put on at the inti mation of visitors but apart from this and few streaks of none too fresh paint he looked very little different from his fellow natives
Yet the man was very tangible and irritating power to the English sta tioned at the nearby post
Logoda white man is missing said the major coming directly to the point of his visit
He was known to have come in your direction
week ago seven days
Seven times the sun he came this way
Where is he
No white man said Logoda se renely
He moved the upper half of his body slightly forward so that his outflung arms came to rest on palms pressed flat against the ground
No white man he said again
Logoda Crosby replied sternly many men will come to search
They will burn your village they will put you in room with many bars
Surprisingly Henley interrupted
Youre wasting our time Major
told you to talk to him in his own language
Will you let me talk to him
No snapped the major angrily
Im convinced youre needlessly worried
Weve no actual proof that your brothers dead and theres Once again Henley interrupted him
Im going to look at those heads he said and before Crosby could stop him he stepped forward
Instantly Logoda pointed furiously at Henley and shouted You go way But Henley paid no attention
He stood under the dried heads gazing at them imperturbably mid Logodas furious mouthings and Major Cros bys nervous scrutiny
Suddenly Henley caught his breath and expelled it again with sharp hissing sound
he muttered
Major Crosby expostulated
Now look here Henley Logodas not had time to dry head
Only week hardly that
Henley looked at him
You are too new here Major Crosby he said
know how quickly they can dry them
There was something about Hen leys cold stare that stayed Crosbys angry words on his
Abruptly Logoda crossed his hands before his face bowed his head quickly to the ground and turned to ward the dried heads flinging out his arms as if in entreaty to them his palms turned upward toward them
From his mouth issued stream of weird gibberings
He is talking to the heads said Henley softly
Do not be surprised if they answer
You dont actually believe in this torn foolery Henley
demanded the major incredulously
Yes said Henley simply
Bob and have studied it long LOGODAS HEADS time
There is more in it than you think
Logodas gibbering quickly ceased
For moment there was complete si lence
The major was about to stalk out disgusted Then there sounded as if from far away shrill strange tittering it grew it mounted until it sounded all about them
and then it sub sided it subsided into subdued whispering which was lost grad ually lost in silence again
Above them Logodas heads were The majors skepticism was shaken and he was trying not to show it
Will you do me this favor Major
will not bother you again on my honor
want to talk to Logodas heads and do not want him to hear what say to them
The simplicity with which this re quest was uttered was in strange con trast to the wierdness of its content
The major swallowed with some difficulty and asked in thick voice Will you go after that
Yes Ill go then replied Henley
Coming in the NEXT ISSUE THE MAN WHO WAS DEATH Complete Novelet of Supernatural Powers By NORMAN DANIELS PLUS MANY OTHER GRIPPING TALES OF THE UNCANNY swaying back and forth though no one had touched them
Good God whispered the major
Major said Henley in strong voice will you take Logoda out of the hut for minute or two
want to be alone here
LOGODA sat smiling to himself his eyes hslfclosed rocking back and forth little like drowsy joss
But thought you promised stammered the major
Nothing will be disturbed promise you
Logoda will have no cause for complaint
But then why must he go out
Very well
The major stepped to the doorway and signalled to two of his men knowing they would be needed to move Logoda who would certainly not go of his own volition
Despite his furious protests Logoda was dragged to the doorway where he rose and walked so that his natives might not see this indignity being visited on him
Henley was left alone in the hut and his whispering voice drifted eeri ly to Major Crosby and his men who looked questioningly at each other
Henley was speaking in na tive tongue
STRANGE STORIES Only few minutes elapsed
Then Henley stepped from the hut his eyes glittering strangely and Lo goda after glaring at him in mur derous fury entered his home again
Im ready now Major said Hen ley Very well said the major in low voice
The five men made their long way back to the English post where they arrived just in time for suppsr
For long time Henley and the major did not speak to each other but over coffee at last Henley spoke
How much would you people give to be rid of Logoda
he asked softly
Major Crosby was startled but re solved not to show it
good deal think
But if youre planning to go back there to get him stop now
We could have potted him long time ago but for an Englishman to be seen anywhere around when witchdoctor dies suspiciously is cer tain to cause an insurrection and nasty one
Will you guarantee me passage to the coast
pursed Henley
told you it was impossible Hen ley
need all my men here any way
didnt mean protection meant money
have money waiting for me in Cairo but thats hellish long way off
want to get there and havent enough money
Oh said the major softening
had no idea
Well you dont have to earn it he went on smiling now
Im glad to be able to help you out
And get rid of me murmured Henley smiling too
But theres one more favor want to ask of you before leave
And that
asked the major ap prehensively
want you to tie me to my cot tonight and set guard over me said Henley grimly
What an extraordinary request exclaimed Major Crosby
Nevertheless an earnestly meant one
Will you Major
Well if you insist
And will you go then in the morning
feel very odd about this said the major some hours later as he sat beside the cot to which Henley had been tied
You neednt said Henley shortly
Im just protecting myself
Logo das afraid of me
He isnt afraid of you if youll forgive my saying it
He knows know too much
Bob did too and Bobs dried head now
have decided dont want to die and there are so many ways of bring ing about my death for man like Logoda
He could call me and would have to follow
Or he could come himself maybe little white dog or snake almost anything
Thats the why of all this you see
Really Henley
said the major somewhat stiffly youre talking like the most impossible madman
find it difficult to believe that youre the same man who has been so sane in my company the previous weeks
Yes understand that said Hen ley
know how you feel
am sorry to disturb the waters like that
Most of us like them smooth
But there are things like this and they do happen
Bob and have studied them too long to deny them
You dont have to believe them youd probably be better off without know ing anything about them
fWKHO made that laughter this ww afternoon and who made those heads sway like that
asked the major curiously and obviously against his will
told you Logoda spoke to them and they answered
Thats not telling me thing re plied the major
Perhaps not
Thats the only an swer though
Now forgive me Ive got long journey ahead of me and Ive got to get some sleep
In the morning Henley awoke to find the major bending over him un tying the ropes that bound him
Good morning Henley said
Hope you slept well
Thanks said the major smiling
Did anyone call for me in the LOGODAS HEADS night
asked Henley his voice grim
No one
watched for dogs and snakes and things and even consid ered potting couple of birds that got lost in the clearing
Good old major

asked the major then
am expecting message and as soon as it comes Ill be on my way
From whom
asked Major Crosby bluntly
That cant say
But you have scouts out havent you
Of course said Crosby shortly
Henley smiled
THEY were at breakfast when one of the majors scouts came dodg ing out into the clearing
He was ex cited and breathless from the exer tion of running
Theres my message think said Henley calmly
How about my passage money Major
The scout came up to them
Lo godas dead he said jerkily
Hes been killed
echoed the major
Good God
hope there werent any Eng lishmen around
Howd it happen
The natives say his magic killed him
Its queer business sir
His guards didnt see anyone enter the hut or anyone come out
They heard Logoda talking to his heads and they heard the heads answer
Then they heard him cough once or twice and finally he slept
That was all
This morning he was found in his hut with his throat torn out terribly mutilated cut and torn as if by thou sands of rats
Go back and find out whatever else you can ordered Major Crosby
The scout disappeared at once into the jungle
Crosby turned to Henley
You were on the bed all night Henley
And you guessed Logoda would be killed
Who did it
the question came angrily

Major Crosby flushed
Nonsense he snapped
Henley stood up smiling
Yet his voice was grim
told you it wasnt good to know about forbidden things
But Ill tell you
You heard Logoda and those heads and you will recall my insist ence on being left alone with them
Logoda knew how to make them talk and sway back and forth
knew how to make them rend and tear

inJi ed This is the tale they tell King that ere the royal banners were lifted upon the tall towers of Chaldean Ur before the Winged Pharaohs reigned in secret Aegyp tus there were mighty empires far to the east
There in that vast desert known as the Cradle of Mankind aye even in the heart of the measureless Gobi great wars were fought and high palaces thrust their minarets up to the purple Asian sky
But this King was long ago beyond the memory of the oldest sage the splendor of Imperial Gobi lives now only in the dreams of minstrels and poets
The Tale of Sakhmet the Damned
CHAPTER The Gates oi War IN THE gray light of the false dawn the prophet had climbed to the outer wall of Sardopolis his beard streaming in the chill wind
Before him stretching across the broad plain were the gay tents and pavilions of the besieging army em blazoned with the scarlet symbol of the wyvern the winged dragon be neath which King Cyaxares of the north waged his wars
Already soldiers were grouped about the catapults and scaling towers and knot of them gathered beneath the wall where the prophet Complete Novelet of Inhuman Bondage Someone Bung shield
Kialch Pan Plays His Pipes and Rushing Wind By HENRY KUTTNER uthor of The nresting Dead The Frog etc
Roars Through the Cradle of Mankind
STRANGE STORIES stood
Mocking rough taunts were voices but for time the white bearded oldster paid no heed to the gibes
His sunken eyes beneath their snowy penthouse brows dwelt on the far distance where forest swept up into the mountain slopes and faded into blue haze
His voice came thin piercing
Wo wo unto Sardopolis
Fallen is Jewel of Gobi fallen and lost for ever and all its glory gone
Dese cration shall come to the altars and the streets shall run red with blood
see death for the king and shame for his people
For time the soldiers beneath the wall had been silent but now spears lifted they interrupted with tor rent of halfamused mockery
bearded giant roared Come down to us old goat
Well welcome you indeed
THE prophets eyes dropped and the shouting of the soldiers faded into stillness
Very softly the ancient spoke yet each word was clear and distinct as swordblade
Ye shall ride through the streets of the city in triumph
And your king shall mount the silver throne
Yet from the forest shall come your doom an old doom shall come down upon you and none shall escape
He shall return He the mighty one who dwelt here once
The prophet lifted his arms star ing straight into the red eye of the rising sun
Then he stepped forward
Two steps and plunged
Straight down his beard and robe streaming up till the upthrust spears caught him and he died
And that day the gates of Sar dopolis were burst in by giant bat teringrams and like an unleashed flood the men of Cyaxares poured into the city wolves who slew and plundered and tortured mercilessly
Terror walked that day and haze of battle hung upon the roofs
The defenders were hunted down and slaughtered in the streets without mercy
Women were outraged their children impaled and the glory of Sardopolis faded in smoke of shame and horror
The last glow of the setting sun touched the scarlet wyvern of Cyaxares floating from the tallest tower of the kings palace
Flambeaux were lighted in their sockets till the great hall blazed with red fire reflected from the silver throne where the invader sat
His black beard was all bespattered with blood and grime and slaves groomed him as he sat among his men gnawing on muttonbone
Yet despite the mans gashed and broken armor and the filth that besmeared him there was something unmistak ably regal about his bearing
kings son was Cyaxares the last of line that had sprung from the dawn ages of Gobi when the feudal barons had reigned
But his face was tragic ruin
Strength and power and nobility had once dwelt there and traces of them still could be seen as though in muddy water through the mask of cruelty and vice that lay heavy upon Cyaxares
His gray eyes held cold and passionless stare that van ished only in the crimson blaze of battle and now those deadly eyes dwelt on the bound form of the con quered king of Sardopolis Chalem
In contrast with the huge figure of Cyaxares Chalem seemed slight yet despite his wounds he stood stiffly upright no trace of expression on his pale face
strange contrast
The marbled tapestried throneroom of the palace was more suitable to gay pageantry than this grim scene
The only man who did not seem incongruously out of place stood beside the throne slim dark youth clad in silks and velvets that had apparently not been marred by the battle
This was Necho the kings confidant and some said his familiar demon
Whence he had come no one knew but of his evil power over Cyaxares there was no doubt little smile grew on the youths handsome face
Smoothing his curled dark hair he leaned close and whis pered to the king
The latter nodded waved away maiden who was oiling his beard and said shortly Your power is broken Chalem CURSED BE THE CITY Yet are we merciful
Render homage and you may have your life
For answer Chalem spat upon the marble flags at his feet
curious gleam came into Cy axares eyes
Half inaudibly he mur mured brave man
Too brave to die
Some impulse seemed to pull his head around until he met Nechos gaze
message passed in that si lent staring
For Cyaxares took from his side long bloodstained sword he rose stepped down from his dais and swung the brand
CHALEM made no move to evade the blow
The steel cut through bone and brain
As the dead man fell Cyaxares stood looking down without trace of expression
He wrenched his sword free
Fling this carrion to the vul tures he commanded
From the group of prisoners near by came an angry oath
The king turned to face the man who had dared to speak
He gestured
pair of guards pushed forward tall wellmuscled figure yellow haired with face strong despite its youth now darkened with rage
The man wore no armor and his torso was crisscrossed with wounds
Who are you
Cyaxares asked with ominous restraint the sword bare in his hand
King Chalems son Prince Ray nor
You seek death
Raynor shrugged
Death has come close to me today
Slay me if you will
Ive butchered about dozen of your wolves anyway and thats some satisfaction
Behind Cyaxares came rustle of silks as Necho moved slightly
The kings lips twitched beneath the shaggy beard
His face was sud denly hard and cruel again
Well you will crawl to my feet before the next sun sets
He gestured
No doubt there are tor ture vaults beneath the palace
Su drach
brawny leather clad man stepped forward and saluted
You have heard my will
See to it
If crawl to your feet Raynor said quietly itll be to hamstring you bloated toad
The king drew in his breath with an angry sound
Without another word he nodded to Sudrach and the torturer followed Raynor as he was conducted out
Then Cyaxares went back to his throne and mused for time till slave brought him wine in gilded chalice
But the liquor had no power to break his dark mood
At last he rose and went to the dead kings apartments which the invaders had not dared to plunder for fear of Cy axares wrath
Above the silken couch gleaming image hung from its standard the scarlet wyvern wings spread barbed tail stiffly up right
Cyaxares stood silently star ing at it for space
He did not turn when he heard Nechos soft voice
The youth said The wyvern has conquered once again
Aye Cyaxares said dully
Once again through vileness and black shame
It was an evil day when we met Necho
Low laughter came
Yet you sum moned me as remember
was content enough in my own place till you sent your summons
Involuntarily the king shuddered
would Ishtar had sent down her lightnings upon me that night
You worship another god now
Cyaxares swung about snarling
Necho do not push me too far
have still some power You have all power the low voice said
As you wished
For dozen heartbeats the king made no answer
Then he whispered am the first to bring shame upon our royal blood
When was crowned swore many vow on the tombs of my fathers and for time kept those vows
ruled with truth and chivalry And you sought wisdom
was not content
sought to make my name great and to that end talked with sorcerers with Bleys of the Dark Pool
Bleys Necho murmured
He STRANGE STORIES was learned in his way
Yet he died
The kings breathing was unsteady
slew him at your com mand
And you showed me what happened thereafter
Bleys is not happy now Necho said softly
He served the same master as you
Wherefore The quiet voice grew imperious
Where fore live
For by our bargain shall give you all power on earth fair women and treasure beyond imagina tion
But when you die you shall serve me
The other stood silent while veins swelled on his swarthy forehead
Suddenly with bellowing inarticu late oath he snatched up his sword
Bright steel flamed through the air and rebounded clashing
Up the kings arm and through all his body raced tingling shock and simul taneously the regal apartment seemed to darken around him
The fires of the flambeaux darkened
The air was chill and it whispered
Steadily the room grew blacker
Now all was midnight black save for shining figure that stood im mobile blazing with weird and un earthly radiance
Little murmurs rustled through the deadly stillness
The body of Necho shone brighter blindingly
And he stood without moving or speaking till the king shrank with shuddering cry his blade clattering on the marble
he half sobbed
For His mercy no
He has no mercy the low voice came bleak and chill
Therefore worship me dog whom men call king
Worship me
And Cyaxares worshiped
CHAPTER II Blood in the City PRINCE RAYNOR was acutely uncomfortable
He was stretched upon rack staring up at the drip ping stones of the vaults roof and Sudrach the torturer was heating iron bars on the hearth
great cup of wine stood nearby and occa sionally Sudrach humming under his breath would reach for it and gulp noisily
thousand pieces of gold if you help me escape Raynor repeated without much hope
What good is gord to flayed man
Sudrach asked
That would be my fate if you escaped
Also where would you get thousand golden pieces
In my apartment Raynor said
Safely hidden
You may be lying
At any rate youll tell me where this hiding place is when burn out your eyes
Thus Ill have the gold if it exists without danger to myself
Raynor made no answer but in stead tugged at the cords that bound him
They did not give
Yet Raynor strained until blood throbbed in his temples and was no closer to free dom when he relaxed at last
Youll but wear yourself out Sudrach said over his shoulder
Best save your strength
Youll need it for screaming
He took an iron bar from the fire
Its end glowed redly and Raynor watched the implement with fascinated hor ror
An unpleasant way to die
But as the glowing bar approached Raynors chest there came an inter ruption
The iron door was flung open and tall hugemuscled black entered
Sudrach turned involuntar ily lifting the bar as weapon
Then he relaxed his eyes questioning
Who the devil are you
he grunted
Eblik the Nubian said the black bowing
bear message from the king
lost my way in this damned palace and just now blundered to my goal
The king has two more prisoners for your hands
Sudrach rubbed his hands
Where are they
In the The other stepped closer
He fumbled in his belt
Then abruptly bloodreddened dagger flashed up and sheathed it self in flesh
Sudraoh bellowed thrust out clawing hands
He doubled up slowly while his attacker leaped CURSED BE THE CITY free and then he collapsed upon the dank stones and lay silent twitching little
The gods be praised
Raynor grunted
Eblik faithful servant you come in time
Ebliks dark gargoylish face was worried
Let me He slashed the cords that bound the prisoner
It wasnt easy
When we were separated in the battle master knew Sardopolis would fall
changed clothes with one of Cy axares men whom slew and waited my chance to escape
It was by the merest luck that heard you had offended the king and were to be tortured
So He shrugged
Raynor free at last sprang up from the rack stretching his stif fened muscles
Will it be easy to escape
Many are drunk or asleep
At any rate we cant stay here
The two slipped cautiously out into the corridor
guard lay dead weltering in his blood not far away
They hurried past him and silently threaded their way through the pal ace more than once dodging into passages to evade detection
If knew where Cyaxares slept Id take my chances on slitting his throat Raynor said
This way
At the end of narrow hall was door which pushed open showed moonlit expanse of garden
Eblik said remember entered this way
Here He dived into bush and presently emerged with sword and heavy battleax the latter he thrust in his girdle
What now
Over the wall Raynor said and led the way
The high rampart was not easy to scale but spreading tree grew close to it and eventually the two had surmounted the barrier
As Raynor dropped lightly to the ground he heard sudden cry and glancing around saw group of men armor gleaming in the moon light racing toward him
He cursed softly
Eblik was already fleeing his long legs covering the yards with amaz ing speed
Raynor followed though his first impulse was to wait and give battle
But in the stronghold of Cyaxares such an action would have been suicidal
Behind the pair the pursuers bayed menace
Swords came out flashing
Raynor clutched his comrades arm dragged him into side alley and the two sped on frantically search ing for hidingplace
It was Eblik who found sanctuary five minutes later
Passing the bloodsmeared corpselittered courtyard of tem ple he gasped hasty word and in moment both Raynor and Eblik were across the moonlit stretch and fleeing into the interior of the tem ple
From high roof hung golden ball dim in the gloom
This was the sacred house of the Sun the dwell ing place of the primal god Ahmon
Eblik had been here before and knew the way
He guided Raynor past torn tapestries and overthrown censers and then halting before golden curtain he listened
There was no sound of pursuit
the Nubian warrior said
Ive heard of secret way out of here though where it is dont know
Maybe we can find it
ME drew the curtain aside and the two entered the sanctuary of the god
Involuntarily Raynor whis pered curse and his brown fingers tightened on his rapier hilt
small chamber faced them with walls and floor and ceiling blue as the summer sky
It was empty save for single huge sphere of gold in the center
Broken upon the gleaming ball was man
From the wall single flambeau cast flickering radiance on the twisted bloodstained body on the white beard that was dappled with blood
The man lay stretched across the globe his hands and feet im paled with iron spikes that had been driven deeply into the gold
Froth bubbled on his lips
His hoary head rolled eyes stared un seeingly
He gasped Water
For the love of Ahmon drop of water
Raynors lips were hard white STRANGE STORIES line as he sprang forward
Eblik helped him as he pried the spikes free
The tortured priest moaned and bit at his mangled lips but made no outcry
Presently he lay prostrate on the blue floor
With muttered word Eblik disappeared and came back bearing cup which he held to the dying mans mouth
The priest drank deeply
He whis pered Prince Raynor
Is the King safe
Swiftly Raynor answered
The others white head rolled
Lift me up swiftly
Raynor obeyed
The priest ran his hands over the golden sphere and suddenly beneath his probing fin gers it split in half like cloven fruit and in its center gap wid ened
steep staircase led down into hidden depths
The altar is open
cannot see welL Take me down there
They cannot find us in the hidden cham ber
Raynor swung the priest to his shoulders and without hesitation started down the steps Eblik behind him
There was low grating as the altar swung back gleaming sphere that would halt and baffle pursuit
They were in utter darkness
The prince moved cautiously testing each step before he shifted his weight
At last he felt the floor level be neath his feet
SLOWLY dim light began to grow like the first glow of dawn
It revealedi bare stone vault roughly constructed of mortised stones strangely at variance with the palatial city above
In one wall dark hole showed
On the floor was circular disk of metal its center hollowed out into cup
Within this cup lay broken shard of some rock that resembled goldshot marble half as large as Raynors hand
On the shard were carved certain sym bols the prince did not recognize and one that he did the ancient looped cross sacred to the sungod
He put the priest down gently but nevertheless the man moaned in agony
The maimed hands clutched at air
Great Ahmon
give me more water
Eblik obeyed
Strengthened the priest fumbled for and gripped Ray nors arm
You are strong
Strength is needed for the mission you must undertake
The priests fingers tightened
Aye Ahmon guided your steps hither
You must be the messenger of vengeance
Not have not long to live
My strength ebbs
He was silent for time and then resumed have tale to tell you
Do you know the legend of the founding of Sardopolis
How long ago very terrible god had his altar in this spot and was served by all the forest dwellers
till those who served Ahmon came
They fought and prisoned the forest god drove him hence to the Valley of Silence and he lies bound there by strong magic and the seal of Ahmon
Yet there was prophecy that one day Ahmon would be overthrown and the bound god would break his fetters and return to his first dwell ing place to the ruin of Sardopolis
The day of the prophecy is at hand
The priest pointed
All is dark
Yet the seal should be there is it not
Raynor said bit of marble Aye the talisman
Lift it up
The voice was now peremptory
Ray nor obeyed
have it
Guard it well
Lift the disk now
Almost apprehensively the prince tugged the disk up finding it cu riously light
Beneath was nothing but jagged stone crudely carved with archaic figures and symbols
stone yet Raynor knew somehow that the thing was horribly old that it had existed from the dawn ages of Gobi
The altar of the forest god said the priest
He will return to this spot when he is freed
You must go to the Reaver of the Rock and give him the talisman
He will know its meaning
So shall Ahmon be avenged upon the tyrant
CURSED BE THE CITY Suddenly the priest surged up right his arms lifted tears streaming from the blind eyes
He cried Ohe ohi
Fallen forever is the House of Ahmon
Fallen to the dust
He fell as tree falls crashing down upon the stones his arms still extended as though in worship
So died the last priest of Ahmon in Gobi
Raynor did not move for while
Then he bent over the lax body
hasty examination showed him that the man was dead and shrugging he thrust the marble shard into his belt
suppose thats the way out he said pointing to the gap in the wall though dont like the look of it
Well come on
He squeezed himself into the nar row hole cursing softly and Eblik followed
CHAPTER III The Reaver of the Rock WITH slow steps Cyaxares paced his apartment his shaggy brows drawn together in frown
Once or twice his hand closed con vulsively on his swordhilt and again the secret agony within him made him groan aloud
But not once did he glance at the scarlet symbol of the wyvern that hung above his couch
Going to window he looked down over the city and then his gaze went out to the plain and the distant forested mountains
He sighed heavily
voice said You may well look there Cyaxares
For there is your doom unless you act swiftly
Is it you Necho
the king asked heavily
What new shamefulness must work now
Two men go south to the Valley of Silence
They must be slain ere they reach it
What aid can they get there
Nccho did not answer at first
His voice was hesitant when he said The gods have their own secrets
There is something in the Valley of Silence that can send all your glory and power crashing down about your head
Nor can aid you then
can only advise you now and if you fol low my advice well
But act can not and must not for reason which you need not know
Send out your men therefore with orders to over take those two and slay them swiftly
As you will the king said and turned to summon servitor
ffJOLDIERS follow us Eblik said shading his eyes with calloused hand
He was astride rangy dun mare and beside him Ray nor rede on great gray charger red of nostril and fiery of eye
The lat ter turned in the saddle and looked back
By the gods
he observed
Cy axares has sent half an army after us
Its lucky we managed to steal these mounts
The two had reined their horses at the summit of low rise in the forest
Back of them the ground sloped to the great plain and the gutted city of Sardopolis before them jagged mountains rose covered with oak and pine and fir
The Nu bian licked dry lips said thirstily The fires of all hells are in my belly
Lets get out of this wilder ness where theres nothing to drink but water
The Reaver may feed you wine or blood Raynor said Neverthe less our best chance is to find this Reaver and
seek his aid
mer cenary once told me of the road
He clapped his heels against the chargers flanks and the steed bounded forward
In moment the ridge had hidden them from the men of Cyaxares
So the two pene trated deeper and deeper into the craggy desolate wilderness place haunted by wolves and great bears and men whispered monstrous snakelike cockadrills
They went by snowpeaked moun tains that lifted white cones to the STRANGE STORIES blue sky and they fled along the brink of deep gorges from which the low thunder of cataracts rose tumultuously
And always behind them rode the pursuers grim and warlike company following slowly but relentlessly
But Raynor used more than one stratagem
Thrice he guided his charger up streams along which the wise animal picked its way care fully again he dislodged an ava lanche to block the trail
So it came about that when the two rode down into great grassy basin the men of Cyaxares were far behind
On all sides the mountains rose
Ahead was broad meadowlike valley strewn with thickets and green groves
Far ahead the preci pice rose in tall rampart split in one place into narrow canyon
To the right of the gorge lifted great gray rock mountainhuge bare save for winding trail that twisted up its surface to castle upon the summit
Dwarfed by dis tance the size of the huge structure could yet be appreciated castle of stone incongruously bedecked with fluttering bright banners and pen nons
Raynor pointed
He dwells there
The Reaver of the Rock
And here comes danger Eblik said whipping out his battleax
From grove of nearby trees burst company of horsemen glittering in the afternoon sunlight spears lifted casques and helms agleam
Shouting they rode down upon the waiting pair
Raynor fingered his swordhilt hesitating
Put up your blade he directed Eblik
We come in friendship here
The Nubian was doubtful
But do they know that
Nevertheless he sheathed his sword and waited till the dozen riders reined in few paces away
One spurred forward tall man astride wiry black
Are you tired of life that you seek the Reavers stronghold
he demanded
Or do you mean to en ter in his service
We bear message Raynor countered
message from priest of Ahmon
We know no gods here the other grunted
Well you know warfare or Ive misread the dents in your armor Raynor snapped
Sardopolis is fallen
Cyaxares has taken the city and slain the king my father Chalem of Sardopolis
TO his amazement bellow of laughter burst from the troop
The spokesman said What has that to do with us
We own no king but the Reaver
Yet you shall come safely before him if that is your will
It were shameful to battle dozen to two and the rags you wear arent worth the taking
Eblik started like ruffled pea cock
By the gods you have little courtesy here
For coin Id slit your weasand
The other rubbed his throat re flectively grinning
You may have trial at that later if you wish my ragged gargoyle
But come now for the Reaver is in hall and tonight he rides forth on raid
With nod Raynor spurred his horse forward the Nubian at his side and surrounded by the men of the Reaver they fled across the val ley to the castle
Thence they mounted the steep dangerous path up the craggy ramp till at last they crossed drawbridge and dismounted in courtyard
So they took Raynor before the Reaver of the Rock
great shining redcheeked man he was with grizzled gray beard and crown set rakishly askew on tan gled locks
He sat before blazing fire in highroofed stone hall an iron chest open at his feet
From this he was taking jewels and golden chains and ornaments that might have graced kings treasury exam ining them carefully and making notes with quill pen upon parch ment on his lap
He looked up merry eyes dwelt on Raynors flushed face and touseled yellow hair
Well Samar what is it now
CURSED BE THE CITY Two strangers
They have mes sage for you or so they say
Suddenly the Reavers face changed
He leaned forward spilling treasure from his lap
Now there is only one message that can ever come to me
speak you
Who sent you
AYNOR stepped forward confi dently
From his belt he drew the broken shard of marble and ex tended it
priest of Ahmon bade me give you this he said
Sardopolis is fallen
For heartbeat there was silence
Then the Reaver took the shard ex amining it carefully
He murmured Aye
So my rule passes
For long and long my fathers held the Rock waiting for the summons that never came
And now it has come
He looked up
Go all of you save you two
And you Samar wait for you should know of this
The others departed
The Reaver shouted after them Summon Del phia
He turned to stare into the fire
So Kialeh must fulfill the ancient pledge of my ancestors
And in vaders are on my marches
Well There came an interruption
girl strode in dark head proudly erect slim figure corseted in dinted armor
She went to the Reaver flung blazing jewel in his lap
Is this my guerdon
she snarled Faith the gods took Ossans castle almost singlehanded
And my share is less than the share of Samar here
You are my daughter the Reaver said quietly
Shall give you more honor then in our free brotherhood
Be silent
Raynor was examining the girls face with approval
There was beauty there wild dark lawless beauty and strength that showed in the firm set of the jaw and the latent fire of the jet eyes
Ebony hair unbound fell in ringlets about steelcorseleted shoulders
The girl said Well
Have you had your fill of staring
Let be the Reaver grunted
have tale for all of you
His deep voice grew stronger
Ages on ages ago this was bar barous land
The people worshipped forestgod called his hand moved in queer quick sign called Pan
Then from the north came two kings brothers bringing with them the power of the sungod Ahmon
There was battle in the land then and blood and reddened steel
Yet Ahmon conquered
The forestgod was bound within the Valley of Silence which lies be yond my castle
The two kings made an agreement
One was to rule Sar dopolis and the other the younger was to rear great castle at the gateway of the Valley of Silence and guard the fettered god
Until certain word should come
The Reaver weighed glittering stone in his hand
For there was prophecy that one day the rule of Ahmon should be broken
Then it was foretold that the forestgod should be freed and should bring vengeance upon the destroyers of Sardopolis
For long and long my ancestors have guarded the Rock and Kialeh am the last
Ah he sighed
The great days are over indeed
Never again will the Reaver ride to rob and plunder and mock at gods
Never whats this
manatarms had burst into the hall eyes alight face fierce as wolfs
An army is in the valley By Shaitan
Raynor cursed
Cyaxares men
They pursued us The girl Delphia swung about
Gather the men
Ill take com mand Suddenly the Reaver let out roaring shout
By all the gods Ive flouted no
Would you grudge me my last battle girl
Gather your men Samar but command
Samar sprang to obey
Delphia gripped her fathers arm
fight with you then
have another task for you
Guide these two through the Valley of Silence to the place you know
Here he thrust the marble shard at the prince
Take this
Youll STRANGE STORIES know how to use it when the time comes
Then he was gone and curtains of black samite swayed into place be hind him
Raynor was curiously eying the girl
Her face was pale beneath its tan and her eyes betrayed fear
Red battle she could face unflinchingly but the thought of entering the Val ley of Silence meant to her some thing far more terrible
Yet she said Come
We have little time
Eblik followed Raynor and Del phia from the hall
They went through the harsh splendor of the castle till at last the girl halted be fore blank stone wall
She pressed hidden spring
section of the rock swung away revealing the dim lit depths of passage
Delphia paused on the threshold
Her dark eyes flickered over the two
Hold fast to your courage she whispered and her Hps were trem bling
For now we go down into HelL
CHAPTER IV The Valley of Silence TT at first there seemed nothing terrible about the valley
They entered it from cavern that opened on thick forest and glancing around Raynor saw tall mountainous ramparts that made the place prison indeed
It was past sunset yet already full moon was rising over the eastern cliffs outlining the Reavers castle in black silhouette
They entered the forest
Moss underfoot deadened their footsteps
They walked in dim gloom broken by moonlit traceries filtered through the leaves
And now Raynor noted the curious stillness that hung over all
There was no sound
The noise of birds and beasts did not exist here nor did the breath of wind rustle the silent trees
But queerly the prince thought there was sound whisper ing through the forest sound be low the threshold of hearing which nevertheless played on his taut nerves
dont like this Eblik said his ugly face set and strained
His voice seemed to die away with uncanny swiftness
Pan is fettered here Delphia whispered
Yet is his power mani fest
Soundlessly they went through the soundless forest
And now Raynor realized that slowly and impercep tibly the shadowy whisper he had sensed was growing louder or else his ears were becoming more attuned to it
very dim murmur faint and far away which yet seemed to have within it multitude of voices
The voices of the winds
the murmur of forests
the goblin laughter of shadowed brooks
It was louder now and Raynor found himself thinking of all the in numerable sounds of the primeval wilderness
Birdnotes and the call of beasts
And under all dim powerful motif beat wordless shrilling faint piping that set the princes skin to crawling as he heard it
It is the tide of life Delphia said softly
The heartbeat of the first god
The pulse of earth
For the first time Raynor felt something of the primal secrets of the world
Often he had walked alone in the forest but never yet had the hidden heart of the wilderness reached fingers into his soul
He sensed mighty and very terrible power stirring latent in the soil be neath him thing bound inextric ably to the brain of man by the cords of the flesh which came up by slow degrees from the seething oceans which once rolled unchecked over young planet
Unimaginable eons ago man had come from the earth and the brand of his motherworld was burned deep within his soul
Afraid yet strangely happy as men are sometimes happy in their dreams the prince motioned for his companions to increase their pace
The forest gave place to wide clearing with shattered white stones CURSED BE THE CITY rearing to the sky
Broken plinths and peristyles gleamed in the moon light
temple had once existed here
Now all was overgrown with moss and the slowcreeping lichen
Here the girl said in low whis per
In the center of ring of fallen pillars they halted
Delphia pointed to block of marble on which metal disk was inset
In cuplike depression in the metal lay broken bit of marble
The talisman Delphia said
Touch it to the other
and the unearthly tide of hidden life swelling and ebbing all about them
Raynor took the amulet from his belt stepped for ward fighting down his fear
He bent above the disk touched marble shard to marble As iron to lodes tone the two frag ments drew together
They coalesced into one
The jagged line of break age faded and vanished
Raynor held the talisman com plete unbroken
Now quite suddenly the vague murmurings mounted into roar gay jubilant triumphant
The metal disk shattered into fragments
Be neath it the prince glimpsed small carved stone the twin of the one be neath the temple of Ahmon
Above the unceasing roar sounded penetrating shrill piping
Delphia clutched at Raynor arm pulled him back
Her face was chalk white
The pipes
she gasped
Back quickly
To see Pan is to die
Louder the roar mounted and louder
In its bellow was deep shout of alien laughter thunder of goblin merriment
The chuckle of the shadowed brooks was the crash of cataracts and waterfalls
The forest stirred to breath of gusty wind
the girl said urgently
We have freed Pan
Without conscious thought Raynor thrust the talisman into his belt turned and with Delphia and Eblik beside him fled into the moonlit shadows
Above him branches tossed in mounting wind
The wild shriek ing of the pipes grew louder
Tide of earth life rising to mad paean of triumph
The wind exulted Free
And the unseen rivers shouted Great Pan is free
CLATTERING of hoofs came from the distance
Bleating calls sounded from afar
The girl stumbled almost fell
Ray nor gripped at her arm pulling her upright fighting the unreasoning ter ror mounting within him
The Nu bians grim face was glistening with sweat
Pan Pan is free
The black mouth of cavern loomed before them
At its threshold Raynor cast glance behind him saw all the great forest swaying and tossing
His breath coming unevenly he turned following his companions into the cave
he whispered
What demon have loosed on the land
Then it was race sprint pound up the winding passage up an unending flight of stone steps through wall that lifted at Delphias touch and into castle shaking with battle
Raynor stopped short whipping out his sword staring at shadows flicker ing in the distance
Cyaxares men he said
Theyve entered
In the face of fleshandblood an tagonists the prince was suddenly himself again
Delphia was already running down the corridor blade out
Raynor and the Nubian followed
They burst into the great hall
ring of armed men surrounded little group who were making their last stand before the hearth
Tower ing above the others Raynor saw the tangled locks and bristling beard of Kialeh the Reaver and beside him his lieutenant Samar
Corpses lit tered the floor
roared the Reaver as he caught sight of the newcomers
You come in time
In time to die with us
STRANGE STORIES CHAPTER Cursed Be the City RIM laughter touched Raynors lips
He drove in sheathing his sword in brawny throat whipped it out steel singing
Nor were Eblik and Delphi far behind
Her blade and the Nubians ax wreaked deadly havoc among Cyaxares soldiers who not expecting attack from the rear were confused
The hall became filled with mill ing yelling throng from which one soldier burly giant emerged shout ing down the others
Cut them down
Theyre but three
Then all semblance of sanity was lost in blaze of crimson battle swinging brands and huge maces that crashed down splitting skulls and spattering gray brainstuff
Del phia kept shoulder to shoulder with Raynor seemingly heedless of danger her blade flicking wasplike through the air
And the prince guarded her as best he could the sword weaving bright maze of deadly lightnings as it whirled
The Reaver swung and his sword crushed helm and bit deep into bone
He strained to tug it free and soldier thrust up at his throat
Samar deflected the blade with his own weapon and that cost him his life
In that moment of inattention driven spear smashed through corselet and jerkin and drank deep of the mans lifeblood
Silent he fell
The Reaver went beserk
Yelling he sprang over his lieutenants corpse and swung
For few moments he held back his enemies and then someone flung shield
Instinc tively Kialeh lifted his blade to parry
The wolves leaped in to the kill
Roaring the Reaver went down blood gushing through his shaggy beard staining its irongray with red
When Raynor had time to look again Kialeh lay corpse on his own hearth his head amid bright jewels that had spilled from the overturned treasurechest
The three stood together now the last of the defenders Raynor and Eblik and Delphia
The soldiers ringed them panting for their death yet hesitating before the menace of cold steel
None wished to be the first to die
And as they waited little silence fell
The prince heard sound he remembered
Dim and far away low roaring drifted to his ears
And the eerie shrilling of pipes
It grew louder
The soldiers heard it now
They glanced at one another askance
There was something about that sound that chilled the blood
It swelled to gleeful shouting filling all the castle
breeze blew through the hall tugging with elfin fingers at sweatmoist skin
It rose to gusty blast
In its murmur voices whispered
Evohe They grew louder mad and un checked
They exulted
Pan Pan is free
soldier cursed
What devils work is this
He swung about sword ready
The curtains of samite were ripped away by the shrieking wind
Deafen ingly the voices exulted Pan is free
The piping shrilled out
There came the clatter of ringing little hoofs
The castle rocked and shud dered
Some vague indefinable impulse made Raynor snatch at his belt grip ping the sungods talisman in bronzed fingers
From it grateful warmth seemed to flow into his flesh and the roaring faded
He dragged Delphia and the Nu bian behind him
Close to me
Stay close
The room was darkening
No it seemed as though cloudy veil of mist dropped before the three guard ing them
Raynor lifted the seal of Ahmon
The fogveils swirled
Dimly CURSED BE THE CITY through them Raynor could see the soldiers moving swiftly frantically like rats caught in trap
He tight ened one arm about Delphias steel armored waist
Suddenly the hall was icecold
The castle shook as though gripped by Titan hands
The floor swayed be neath the princes feet
The mists darkened
Through rifts he saw halfguessed figures that leaped and bounded
heard elfin hoofs clicking
Horned and shaggy furred beings that cried jubilantly as they danced to the pipes of Pan
Faun and dryad and satyr swung in mad saraband beyond the shroud ing mists
Faintly there came the screaming of men half drowned in the loud shrilling
the demoniac rout thun dered
All hail Pan
With queer certainty Raynor knew that it was time to leave the castle and swiftly
Already the great stone structure was shaking like tree in hurricane
With word to his companions he stepped forward hesitantly the talisman held high
The walls of mist moved with him
Outside the fogwalls the monstrous figures gamboled
But the soldiers of Cyaxares screamed no more
Through castle toppling into ruin the three sped into the court yard across the drawbridge and down the face of the Rock
Nor did they pause till they were safely in the broad plain of the valley
The castle
Eblik barked point ing
It falls
And it was true
Down it came thundering while clouds of ruin spurted up
Then there was only shattered wreck on the summit of the Rock
Delphia caught her breath in little sob
She murmured The end of the Reavers for all time
lived in the castle for more than twenty years
And now its gone like puff of dust before the wind
The walls of fog had vanished
Raynor returned the talisman to his belt
Eblik staring up at the Rock swallowed uneasily
Well what now
he asked
Back along the way we came the prince said
Its the only way out of this wilderness that know of
The girl nodded
Beyond the mountains lie deserts save to ward Sardopolis
But we have no mounts
Then well walk Eblik observed but Raynor caught his arm and pointed
Horses probably stam peded from the castle
And Shai tan
Theres my gray charger
So presently the three rode to ward Sardopolis conscious of wierd dim throbbing that seemed to pulse in the air all about them
AT dawn they topped ridge and saw before them the plain
All three reined in their mounts staring
Beneath them lay the city but changed
It was ruin
Doom had come to Sardopolis in the night
The mighty towers and battle ments had fallen and huge gaps were opened in the walls
Of the kings palace nothing was left but single tower from which ironically the wyvern banner flew
As they watched that pinnacle too swayed and tottered and fell and the scarlet wyvern drifted down into the dust of Sardopolis
On fallen towers and peristyles distant figures moved with odd un gainly boundings
Quickly Raynor turned his eyes away
But he could not shut his ears to the distant cry ing of pipes gay and pagan yet with faintly mournful undertone
Pan has returned to his first altar Delphia said quietly
We had best not loiter here
By all hell agree the Nubian grunted digging his heels into his steeds flanks
Where now Raynor
Westward think to the Sea of Shadows
There are cities on its shore and galleys to take us to haven
Unless He turned ques tioning eyes on Delphia
She laughed little bitterly
cannot stay here
The land is sunk STRANGE STORIES back into the pit
Pan rules
go with you
The three rode to the west
They skirted but did not enter small grove where man lay in agony
It was Cyaxares figure so dreadfully mangled that only sheer will kept him alive
His face was bloody mask
The oncerich garments were tattered and filthy
He saw the three riders and raised his voice in weak cry which the wind drowned
Beside the king slim youthful figure lounged leaning idly against an oaktrunk
It was Necho
Call louder Cyaxares he said
With horse under you you can reach the Sea of Shadows
And if you succeed in doing that you will yet live for many years
Again the king cried out
The wind took his voice and shredded it to impotent fragments
Necho laughed softly
Too late now
They are gone
CYAXARES let his battered head drop his beard trailing in the dirt
Through shredded lips he mut tered if reach the Sea of Shadows
But if you do not you die
And then Low laughter shook the other
Groaning the king dragged him self forward
Necho followed
good horse can reach the Sea of Shadows in three days
If you walk swiftly you may reach it in six
But you must hurry
Why do you not rise my Cyaxares
The king spat out bitter oaths
In agony he pulled himself forward leaving trail of blood on the grass
blood that dripped unceasingly from the twin raw stumps just above his ankles
The stone that fell upon you was sharp
Cyaxares was it not
Necho mocked
But hurry
You have little time
There are mountains to climb and rivers to cross
So in the trail of Raynor and Eb lik and Delphia crept the dying king hearing fainter and ever fainter the triumphant pipes of Pan from Sardopolis
And presently patient as the silent Necho vulture dipped against the blue and took up the pur suit the beat of its wings distinctly audible in the heavy stagnant si lence
And Raynor and Delphia and Eb lik rode onward toward the sea

LORD OF EVIL Moncati Couldnt Be Positive Until He Developed the Fatal Negative
By TALLY MASON Author oi The Lost Wraith House Darkness etc
OLD WEMYSS gave him the packet without question and Moncati stood politely lis tening to him his head cocked little to one side
His bright dark eyes were smiling coldly but his thin lips remained devoid of any movement
confess Id have been afraid of your stepfather myself said We myss
There were some very strange stories about him and the man him self always impressed me as some thing evil
Wemyss coughed nervously and cast glance over his shoulder to where his law partner was at work on brief
Belatedly lowering his voice he added admire your fearlessness Moncati
Thank you said Moncati and left him
Outside his lips smiled and he said within his mind Wemyss you had the secret
His hand tightened little about the packet and the photograph in it
This kind of blackmail would never have occurred to Wemyss
The second print was authentic but the framed photograph had changed again in the night
STRANGE STORIES As he walked through Piccadilly in the sunlight so unusual for Lon don Moncati held his smile and his thoughts dwelt upon the photograph and the occasion upon which he had taken it
About his stepfather We myss had put it mildly indeed
Mon cati himself had heard the old man boast am the Lord of Evil
Sure of himself
Moncati remembered it well and had reason to believe it on natural grounds
Wemyss had not been wrong when he had warned him that the old man had an eye on the legacy coming to Moncati at twentyfive
Moncatis dabbling in photography had saved his life just as Teddifer his stepfather was preparing to leap upon him fingers already curved for his throat the flashlight bulb had gone off
Moncati had risen from his simu lated sleep thrust Teddifer away and gone with the camera and film
He remembered yet the fury and chagrin on the old mans face when he had learned about Moncatis elab orate precautions but he remem bered too that already then he had known that some day he would have to take other steps
MONCATI paused to tear into little pieces the letter that had been with the packet for Wemyss which began In case of my death please forward immediately to In spector Winslow at New Scotland Yard
and went on chuckling to himself now lighthearted and gay with eyes for every pretty girl he met
Deep in his mind he was well sat isfied with himself as proud as old Teddifer had ever been of his magic and necromancy and not little scornful of the evil old man who had come to such prosaic and untimely end
Moncati felt not qualm at re membering how carefully he had tied the cord which had tripped Teddifer at the head of the stairs and left him at the bottom with his scrawny neck broken
After all Moncati had had every provocation he had known that by some design or other Ted difer had meant to accomplish his death and take his legacy and the thought had irritated and at last had worried him into action
If fly bothers me kill it he had told himself then
Why Hot Teddifer
When Moncati reached home he unpacked the enlarged photograph found frame and hung the picture on the wall squarely over his desk so that he might remind himself from time to time of his own clever ness in circumventing the evil old man who had been his stepfather
He had already burnt up most of Teddi fers books and papers and had be gun to rearrange the house to suit his own convenience
He went whistling up the stairs and left the picture there in the patch of sunlight on the wall the evilfaced old man with head half turned toward the hidden camera and the flare that had surprised him Moncati himself in bed the glare of light that made strikingly clear the huge cruel old hands and the de signing mind behind
The sunlight was additionally merciless and there the picture hung Moncati in bed and Hercules Teddifer about to reach for his neck
For some days the picture com forted Moncati it gave him deep seated feeling of contentment of sat isfaction with himself and the world and he glanced at it smiling once or twice day
Then he went down to Sussex for weekend and when he came back he felt for the first time disquieting note about the picture
It was something intangible some thing upon which he could not put finger but it was there
The photograph gave him the old pleasure and satisfaction but there was something more something ma levolent about it and he was irritated to think he did not know what it was
For brief moment he thought that the old mans expression had subtly altered become more calcu lating but being careful about his imagination he dismissed the thought
Two evenings later as he sat at his desk writing difficult letter he glanced absently up at the photo LORD OF EVIL graph and saw movement there
Because the indirect light threw diffused glow over the picture he thought at first that the movement he had seen was normal hallucina tion springing from the slight re focusing of his gaze from paper to photograph but almost instantly his eyes fixed unconsciously upon the spot where he had thought the move ment to have been Hercules Teddi fers hands
With faint tremor he knew that he had seen the old mans large bony hands flex open and close and he involuntarily waited fascinated for the hands to move again
But only for second
He recollected himself and turned the light full upon the photograph faint feeling of panic guiding his hand
He looked at it closely but noth ing happened there was nothing changed about it and he suffered brief moment of distaste before he felt the old pleasure creep over him again the sense of proud security he had made for himself by so fortunately ridding himself of his menacing step father
He sat down again presently and resumed the letter but every little while he caught himself looking ex pectantly up at the photograph watching nervously and uncertainly so that in the end he was obliged to give up the letter somehow his mind would not return to it would not concentrate properly on the task before it
With faintly derisive smile half for himself half for the photograph he left the desk
He had no doubt that his eyes had played trick on him and he slept well that night without dreams
He rose in the morning got at his letter again and finished it without any trouble
On his way out of the house to the Victoria and Albert Museum he gave the photograph fleeting glance with his customary good humor and went whistling into the mornings fog
Not until he was seated comfort ably in the underground did it occur to him that Hercules Teddifers face as he had seen it in the photograph that morning was no longer turned toward the hidden camera
He had not actually realized it at first but his eyes had seen the image had been transmitted and now suddenly he remembered it with certain def initeness which he found difficult to escape
The possibility of any physical change in the photograph was too absurd to entertain seriously he be gan to think very clearly around what his eyes had seen in an attempt to find some explanation of it
But the more he thought the greater his confusion grew until he knew that he must return to the house and as sure himself that such change had not actually taken place
He made mental note at the same time to see about his eyes glasses certainly were indicated
HE let himself in the house with trepidation and went directly to the picture
He looked and looked again stepped back little and stared his mind in outraged tumult
There was change
The old mans face no longer peered out at him in stead it had turned ever so slightly and taken new cognizance of the fig ure in the bed the head bent little and the eyes lost in contemplation
It was incredible but it was true
Moncati took the photograph off its hook and peered closely at it
He rubbed his fingers over it as if be might feel some subtle difference his eyes could not see but there was nothing
Baffled he put it back and stood looking at it for long time until he became conscious of the fact that he was waiting for change to take place there before his eyes
Then angry with himself he turned away and went grimly out of the house intending to complete the days itinerary as he had set it for himself
But somehow before he knew it the museum palled on him and he found himself sitting down to tea with old Wemyss who eyed him little askance
Investment trouble
asked the barrister
Moncati shook his head
No dan STRANGE STORIES ger of that
Ive just developed some curiosity about my late stepfather
Wemyss put on his pincenez and looked at him
God bless my soul
he exclaimed
Whats put you in mind of him now
Hes dead and the worlds the better for it you particularly
Moncati smiled his most persuasive smile
Agreed Mr Wemyss but have reasonable amount of curios ity and Id rather like to know some thing of the nature of those strange stories about which you hinted the last time called on you
Wemyss eyes narrowed
What misguided impulse roused your cu riosity
he asked
Moncati shrugged
Is it mis guided
hesitate to talk about things dont myself understand and yet must put some belief in replied Wemyss because dislike being held up to ridicule even if only in the private opinions of my clients
dont suppose you believe in such things as magic and sorcery eh
Moncati smiled pleasantly and said
Only fool refuses to keep an open mind
Well said answered Wemyss shortly
Teddifer practised that sort of thing squares and circles and spirit rites and such
dont hold with it myself but understand that some very unusual occurrences took place in that house of his
Wemyss shrugged little irri tated but went on
The best can say is that some people died very oddly servants
Two that know of
Both strangled
But of course your stepfather was out of the city at the time
No question about that
Wemyss smiled little oddly with kind of menace behind his lips
He had some queer theories about the projection of psychic doubles and astrals and the like for that matter no one ever found any prints of any kind on those two dead serv ants
Of sudden Wemyss gulped his tea and was off saying over his shoulder God bless my soul
Ive forgotten my appointment with Dot son
Moncati waved at his back but he was puzzled the inference behind Wemyss words was clear enough and somehow Moncati could not get his thoughts away from Hercules Teddifers huge ungainly hands the tough clawlike appendages that had so greedily threatened his own throat
He shook himself presently paid for the tea and wandered somewhat re lunctantly homeward
HE looked at the picture but there was no further change
He was conscious of slight feeling of relief but this was dissipated at once in the memory of that first change
He took the photograph down again and examined it anew but could discover nothing remarkable about it
For the first time he began to be aware of something akin to fear he began to search his memory for some clue to this strange occurrence and at the same time he began to cast around for some manner of escape from the intangible dread he had be un to feel insidiously drawing upon him from the recesses of his mind malignant dread akin to that same fear he had known when first he had be come aware of his stepfathers evil design to kill him
Doggedly he put the picture back on the wall and went about his small tasks
By evening he had sufficiently recovered his composure to contem plate coolly some means of combat ting the subtle dread that lay in the back of his mind
He could not re frain from looking at the picture again but there was no further change and he felt renewal of faith in him self
He had thought once fleetingly of burning the picture but this seemed to him somehow reflection upon the resourcefulness and courage that had brought it into being and he could not contemplate with equanim ity the resultant drain upon his self esteem
Throughout the evening he sat in the room reading his desk light thrown upward upon the picture but nothing happened nothing what ever
He had come almost to expect LORD OF EVIL some further development but this absence of anything again set him doubting what he had first seen
Had there been any change in the first place
Or had his imagination overreached itself
Certain as he was that the old man had first been looking out at him from the photo graph he was equally certain that he was now no longer doing so but if this change had indeed taken place it was utterly against natural law
This thought gave him but little comfort until he realized that he could settle the question of whether or not his imagination had been re miss by taking the negative and hav ing separate print made for com parison
At once he was flooded with strange feeling of freedom from dread he felt that he was about to do the right thing
The possibility that his confidence did not come en tirely from within himself did not occur to him
In the morning he took the nega tive and made second print en larged to the same size as the orig inal
He came to his desk with it and stood it up below the framed photograph
What he saw was so far from re assuring that he caught hold of chair and eased himself into it
Not only was the second print as he had originally believed the framed photo graph to have been but the latter had again changed in the night Her cules Teddifer had moved closer to the figure in the bed and his hands were clenched
Moncati began to perspire coldly
For moment he sat there at loss to know what to do and he thought confusedly of the old mans strange beliefs
Somehow it had not before occurred to him that by photograph ing the old man he had managed however obscurely to himself to per petuate Teddifer and his evil design
But in the height of his misery hope came to him
He came to his feet and in two strides had torn the pho tograph from the wall
Three minutes later all that was left was small drift of ashes
He was utterly relieved at once
How the old man could have man aged recourse to his magic sorcery in this way was beyond Moncati but the knowledge that he had circum vented him second time was not
His opinion of himself soared
He went out to celebrate
He made night of it hilariously told some acquaintances that he was celebrating his freedom and congratulated him self upon shaking off the dread he had known so briefly again
He came in late after midnight his mind little sluggish and threw himself partly dressed on to his bed where he fell asleep at once
Not quite an hour later he awoke
The clock had struck two and he lay drowsily staring into the darkness for some minutes before he heard the sound like the rattling and rustling of paper
Even at that he did not come fully awake he pondered the sound sleepily and was not aware of its approach until it was almost upon his room
THEN he listened carefully won dering what it might be
It was like nothing he had ever heard be fore save for its dry rustling and crackling
He raised himself tiredly on one elbow just as the door of his room opened
This distracted him momen tarily from the sound of movement and he thought draft had drawn it open for at the moment there was nothing but darkness flowing in upon him
Not until an uncanny chill per vaded his senses did he realize that the darkness he saw was not the shadows in the hall but that it was something alive something malig nant
Instantly he was caught in cloud of dread he saw the darkness resolve itself into dim human fig ure one side aglow as if light were falling upon it and heard dry chuckling all too familiar
It was Hercules Teddifers grim face that looked down upon him
Even as an outcry rose to Mon catis lips the ungainly hands closed around his neck
The last thing Moncati remem bered was the thing he had unfor tunately forgotten the second print
BOX from the STARS Complete Novelet of Matter Over Mind
By AMELIA REYNOLDS LONG Author of The Undead The Mechanical Man etc
CHAPTER The Empty Cube WAS with Chatham when he discovered the box and can still remember his cry of de light and surprise when he unearthed it
We had been doing bit of fos sil hunting on piece of land of his in southeastern Pennsylvania where spur of primal rock strata reared its head practically to the surface
So far we had found little more than the usual fossil shells and few fern impressions so battered by time that they were practically worthless
But this was different
At his shout left my own dig ging little distance away and joined him
He was standing over what looked like pocket in the solid rock formed by some freak folding of the strata back in pre glacial times
Look Wilder
he exclaimed It Was Hollow But Not Empty Nothing jubilantly
was trying to chip off this upper layer when my pick went straight through
What do you make of it
got down on my hands and knees and peered into the opening he had made
saw what he was raving about
The pocket extended foot or two in all directions beyond the opening and about four feet downward
And resting flat upon its bottom was rectangular shaped object
What the dickens
exclaimed and began to pry away pieces of the loose rock with my hands
What is it
He got down beside me
Looks as though it might be manmade doesnt it
Nature doesnt work in such perfect cubes
dont know replied thought Was In It But Nothing WasSomething
STRANGE STORIES fully although the same idea had flashed across my own mind
There are certain slate formations But this isnt slate he inter rupted
He picked up shard of the dull colored rock
Its igneous stuff
Much older than slate
But later than the surrounding rock apparently said
scram bled to my feet
Lets enlarge the opening and see what youve found
few blows of our picks cleared away the top of the pocket giving us an unobstructed view into the cavity beneath
It now measured about four feet in all of its dimen sions with the two foot cube resting upon the middle of its floor
Ill drop in and pass it out to you Chatham said
Then we can examine it better
Think you can manage it alone
It looks as though it were made of solid metal
Ill try he answered letting him self down into the hole
If cant well attach ropes
He knelt in the confined space and wrapped his arms about the cube his muscles swelling beneath his khaki shirt in anticipation of the strain
The next instant he had al most gone over backwards taking the cube with him
MIS expression of stunned sur prise was so comical that laughed
Man you dont know your own strength told him
Here let me take it
He rose holding the cube easily under one arm
Believe it or not Wilder he said the things hol low
scoffed taking it from him while he climbed back be side me
But immediately realized that he had spoken the truth no solid could have been so weight less
If its hollow it must be box of some sort said and there must be way to open it
But careful examination first with the naked eye and then with powerful lens revealed not the slightest trace of latch keyhole or hinge
The six sides were as smooth as though they had been cast in one solid piece
Chatham was both excited and dis turbed
He shook his head
There was the beginning of awe in his eyes
One things clear at least he muttered
Its manmade
But made by what sort of man
Its too old for the stone age even if they pos sessed knowledge of metals in those days which they didnt
Why the rock this thing was embedded in must go back to the Pleistocene period
And that was just the beginning of the age of mammals said
We looked at each other and saw the inward sense of strangeness re flected in his eyes and knew that mine held the same reflection
We felt less elated even little subdued
Here was an object unquestionably made by human hands yet found embedded in rocks that had been formed ages before man himself had come into being
Chatham laughed nervously know what Im going to do he said with sudden determination
Im go ing to telegraph for old Gunthorp at the university
Hell be able to explain it if anybody can
got the odd impression that we were like children little frightened and therefore appealing to father for aid and advice
Professor Timothy Gunthorp was like ourselves an amateur archeolo gist but an exceptionally good one
His real work was in the physics department at one of Americas largest universities where he was working upon an experiment to con vert energy into matter thus reversing the usual process
We rode into town in my rattle trap car and sent off our wire at once
Before sundown we had re ceived an answer YOURE MISTAKEN
THERE AINT NO SUCH ANIMAL
WILL COME ON TOMORROW TO SEE IT
We felt better
We were clearing away our breakfast things the next morning when the familiar bald head THE BOX FROM THE STARS and steelrimmed spectacles of Pro fessor Gunthorp looked in at the open door of our shack
Youre fools both of you he an nounced with his customary abrupt ness
Tearing man away from im portant work with cockandbull story
Lets have look at this im possible marvel of yours
went over to our work table and removed the tarpaulin that we had thrown over the box
Gunthorp frowned disapprovingly
So you couldnt leave it where it was until got here he observed
Well you must have taken photo graphs of it in its original position at least
Feeling like utter simpletons we had to admit that in our excitement we had overlooked that bit of rou tine
Gunthorp clucked his tongue in annoyance
And you blockheads call yourselves archeologists he snorted
Only rank amateurs Professor Chatham said humbly
Gunthorp began to examine the box
First he lifted it to test its weight then he rapped upon it with his knuckles
Hollow as your two heads he vouchsafed
He bent closer and studied the metal
Looks like tung sten he observed
But it isnt
Either of you got any idea what it is
We both confessed that we had not
Well neither have he ad mitted sourly
Now take me out and show me where you found it
We conducted him to the spot and stood aside while he examined first the hole itself and then the sur rounding rocks
As his inspection progressed there grew upon his long lean face look of bepuzzle ment that afforded both Chatham and me secret satisfaction
Pres ently he picked up spade that we had neglected to take in the night before and with an energy surpris ing in man of his years began to clear away the rubble for about six feet on all sides of the hole
Of sudden he threw down the spade and whirled upon us
never before suspected either of you of possessing sense of humor he barked at us but in any case your socalled practical joke is rather thin
Practical joke
we gasped to gether
We were both accustomed to Gunthorps peppery outbursts but this did not sound like the usual thing
If theres practical joke Pro fessor its on us too declared
We found the box in that pocket yesterday precisely as we told you in our wire
If anybody put it there for little legpulling they did an unusually clever job for the rock stratum was closed above it
broke into it accidentally with my pick Chatham added
SOMETHING in cur words or at titudes must have convinced him for his manner underwent subtle change
queer unreadable expres sion crept into his eyes
Youve noticed suppose that this rock is not the same as the sur rounding rocks
he queried
We nodded
glacial boulder from the Riss or Wurm began but he interrupted me
Use your eyes Wilder use your eyes
This is no glacial boulder from the Wurm the Riss or any other glacier
Look at its pitted surface
Its fallen meteor
Even with my limited knowledge of meteorology realized all at once that he spoke the truth
The thought was dizzying
Millions of years ago this huge blob of mat ter had been drawn into the earths gravitational field and had become embedded in the still soft rocks
Probably it had originally been bu ried hundreds of feet deep and the gradual weathering and wearing down of the top strata through countless millenia had only within the past thousand or so years brought it near the surface near enough for our spades to strike
Chatham was staring at the gray pitted mass that the professors STRANGE STORIES spade had cleared
But but the box
he asked dazedly
Exactly Gunthorp repeated
The box
Without another word the three of us marched back to the shack for further examination of our myster ious find
But we learned no more than we already knew
Acid tests showed that it was composed of an alloy of tungsten and some other metal with which we were unfamiliar further proof if we had needed any that it was the work of intelligent beings
But that those beings could have been inhabitants of this earth was utterly impossible both because of the tremendous age of the rocks in which the box had been embedded and its unquestionable encasement in meteor
WILD thoughts flashed through my mind imaginings based on remembered legends of race be fore the time of Adam and of things that had supposedly drifted down from the stars
But did not men tion them to Gunthorp
He was striving desperately to keep matters on rational prosaic plane
Besides there was bound to be some less fan tastic explanation there had to be
What Id like to know Chatham remarked in the manner of one thinking aloud is what the thing was for
Why should it have been made hollow
Gunthorp looked up
Why not cut it open and find out
he asked
The suggestion seemed like good one and we agreed
Chatham brought out the large plate camera and took several pictures of the box from all angles then set to work upon it with cold chisel
We got our second shock
My greatest efforts produced not sin gle dent in the tough metal
Chatham and Gunthorp tried their hands but with no better success
Between us we turned the edges on four tools the box itself remained practically unscratched
Chatham ran his fingers through his red hair
Its lot tougher than ordinary tungsten he said Then he had an idea
Going over to the supply cupboard he brought back two phials one containing iron oxide the other powdered aluminum
If this doesnt do the trick well get an oxyacetylene torch he said
Not bad Gunthorp commented in what was for him extravagant praise
Of course theres chance of its marring the inside when it burns through but well have to run that risk
He took the two vials from Chat ham and blended their contents in thin careful line along the four edges of the boxs topmost plane
Then he lit it
There was sharp hiss as the pow ders ignited then it began to burn with brilliant greenish white flame
Wordlessly we watched that hol low square of fire keeping well back from the tremendous heat that it generated
Slowly it began to sink into the metal eating its way like an acid
In another minute or so it would be through and the top of the cube would drop inward
Gunthorp was standing by with pail of water which he meant to dash over it at the crucial moment
He had even taken step forward when without an instants warning the un expected happened
With final sputter the burning powder ate through the last thin bit of metal but instead of falling in the top of the box flew upward
There was rush of escaping force the word does not describe it prop erly but it is the nearest can find and we were hurled backwards into unconsciousness
We all regained our senses at about the same time and stared at one another in bewilderment What was it
An infernal machine
But knew better even as spoke
Had there been any kind of explo sion our frail shack would have been in ruins whereas not even the glass of the windows were broken
Gunthorp picked himself up and went over to the work table
Whatever it was its left no trace behind it he said jerkily
He held THE BOX FROM THE STARS up the cube still glowing redly around its seared edges
Its interior was as blank and uninformative as its exterior had been
It couldnt have been gas of any kind Chatham supplemented
gas powerful enough to knock us all out would have left some after effects
It was more like like He groped inadequately for words
Like great mental shock supplied trying to analyze my own feelings at the time
Thats it
Gunthorp rasped
The thing that was in that box paralyzed our minds temporarily
But its gone now he added with rueful shrug dissipated upon the air and thats the end of it
But for once Professor Timothy Gunthorp was wrong
CHAPTER II Missing Men TWO weeks drifted by
Gunthorp had returned to his research work at the university where in his spare time he was writing mono graph upon our mysterious discov ery and subsequent experience work which he told us frankly he had little hope that anyone would believe
Chatham and had gone back to our fossil hunting and al though we talked about the box often we felt that there was nothing more we could do about it
Then one day Chatham who had gone into town for supplies brought back strange story
There was be tween our camp and the town fair sized woods that formed veritable paradise for rabbit hunters during the game season
Since the season had just opened the day before swarm of them had descended upon it
And that was where Chathams story came in
It seemed that party of local men had started out early in the morning and had separated after reaching the woods according to custom
After hunting all day they met again at lodge that they kept to spend the night and they dis covered that one of their number man named Ed Stanton was missing
They waited for him until ten oclock then fearing that he might have met with an accident they set out in search of him
They searched with lanterns for half the night but found no trace of the missing man
Finally someone suggested that he might have gone home instead of returning to the lodge so they inquired there
But without result
Members of his fam ily and neighbors had then joined in the search which had continued throughout the night with the com ing of daylight Stanton was still missing
Looks bad commented when Chatham had finished his recital
That woods is large enough so that if he were badly hurt or killed he could lie there for days before being discovered
know it Chatham said
He glanced toward the forbidding dens ity of the woods scome half mile away
What do you say we join in the search
was willing and we set out to gether
The going was slow
It was nearly noon when we encountered three members of the original hunt ing party coming from the opposite direction
What luck
The oldest of the group shook his head
Not any he replied
Weve found plenty of fresh marks in the bushes but with the gang that was in here yesterday its impossible to tell whether any of them are Eds
It seems funny that he could have disappeared this way but of course weve got good bit of territory still to search
What about his dog
Chatham asked
Didnt he have dog
Thats another funny thing the other answered
The dogs gone too
However we found the dog or rather another party did around three oclock in the afternoon
It was lying under clump of laurel STRANGE STORIES bushes and it was dead with its tail drawn down between its legs and its eyes bulging
But there was not single mark of violence upon its body
Maybe it got hold of something that poisoned it one fellow sug gested as number of us gathered round
But the county sheriff who had now taken charge of the search shook his head
It wasnt any poison killed that dog he declared
Look at his eyes and tail
He was scared to death plumb scared
Id swear it
And damn it Im scared too
We redoubled our searching ef forts
We thrashed literally every foot of the underbrush within mile radius of the place where we had found the dog
We found no trace of Stanton
With the coming of night the sheriff called us all together
No use going on after dark he told us
These woods are too thick and we couldnt do thorough job
Better to wait until daylight and start in again
WOWEVER few searchers con JKL tinued on their own and in the morning one of them farm laborer named Jake Mills had somewhat weird story to relate
He and com panion had penetrated with lantern into the deepest part of the woods when of sudden they had become aware of strong sensation of being followed
We didnt hear nothin and we didnt see nothin Jake explained
It was just the way you feel when somebodys behind you starin with all his might at the back of your head
We turned around and sent the light of the lantern as far as it would go among the trees but there was nothin there
We even went back apiece but we couldnt find anything
Yet every time wed start on wed have that feelin of some thin behind us but not as close as it had been the first time
Finally it got on our nerves and so we de cided wed better take the sheriffs advice and wait till mornin
It was this story of Jakes that gave rise to the belief that an es caped lunatic with homicidal ten dencies might be hiding in the woods
But checkup of all the local and even more distant institu tions for the insane revealed that all their inmates were accounted for
number of the men began to laugh at what they called Jakes case of cold feet
Others remembered Stan tons dog and werent so free with their jibes
Nor were the others when four days later second man disappeared
He was Dr Philip Morse mem ber of Boston society for physical research
He had arrived at the local hotel shortly after Stantons disap pearance and advanced the theory that the missing man had fallen vic tim to some elemental or earth spirit that had been released in the woods
There was considerable amusement at his statement
But when he calmly announced his intention of camping alone in the woods in an attempt to contact the thing the amusement faded
Its not that hold with your ghost stories Dr Morse the sheriff told him but theres something in them woods thats snatched Ed Stan ton away bodily and scared the life out of his dog
man aint safe there alone
Dr Morse only smiled
That eve ning he pitched small tent near the place where Jake Mills and his companion had first felt they were being followed
Early the next morning the sher iff and two other men went out to check up on him
What gruesome horror they expected to discover they themselves did not know but they found the doctor calmly pre paring his breakfast after an un eventful night
The fact that he had spent one night alone in those supposedly sin ister woods without anything out of the ordinary befalling him lulled everyone into false sense of secur ity
Hence the discovery that was made the following day was doubly shocking
party of searchers coming upon the camp around noon of the second THE BOX FROM THE STARS day found it literally torn to pieces
As for Dr Morse himself he had disappeared as completely as Stanton had done five days before
Chatham and went to view the wreckage as soon as we heard about it
We found large crowd there looking about
Looks like cyclone hit the place one man remarked as we stopped beside him
The doc must have put up fearful fight
cyclone or lunatic another amended
One of them funny farms must be holdin out on us
But the tent was demolished the camp furniture bedding and even articles of clothing were torn to pieces in way that even the most desperate struggle could not properly account for
The sheriff came over to us
Well at least we know where Morse was when he was attacked he said
Ive sent to Philadelphia for bloodhounds when they come Im going to start out from here and see what they can find
We complimented him upon the plan
He nodded then with sig nificant glance and quick gesture im plied that he had something else to discuss with us in private
He mo tioned us aside
found this notebook under part of the tent he explained when we had drawn little away from the others
Morse must have been writ ing in it just before the thing got him
thought maybe you fellows would take look at it and tell me whether theres anything in it except just craziness
took the notebook from him and flipped open the top cover
Several pages were covered with cramped closely written shorthand almost un decipherable
It will take little while to figure this out said
May keep it until tomorrow morning
Sure he agreed readily
Keep it as long as you like just so you find out what it says
But was destined not to trans late personally more than the open ing pages of that manuscript for that evening the bloodhounds arrived
CHAPTER III The Cave AT THE sheriffs invitation we joined him and party of about dozen others on the manhunt
Darkness had already fallen when we assembled at the scene of Dr Morses demolished camp
In the flickering yellow light of lanterns the shadows of trees and bushes danced and writhed in grotesque contortions giving the scene an eeriness that un pleasantly affected all of us
little to one side stranger stood with the dogs two powerful black fellows who lolled passively at the ends of their chains as though they had no interest in what was going on
Presently the sheriff went over and held brief lowvoiced con versation with their owner then he addressed the rest of us
Mr Pattons gonna let the dogs go now he announced
He says we should stand back till theyve picked up the scent then we can follow as close as were able
If they start up any ruckus you fellas that have guns aint to use them unless you can see plain what youre shootin at
Youre liable to hit the dogs or the doc
The man called Patton was hold ing part of torn coat evidently Morses against the muzzle of first one dog then the other
When they had sniffed their fill he slipped the chains from their collars and with final indistinguishable command to them stepped back
Noses pressed to the ground the two animals began to run around the wreckage of the tent in gradually widening circles
Then with kind of nasal whine one of them suddenly darted off at tangent followed al most immediately by the other
With feeling of rising excite ment we started after them falling into rough single file to facilitate travel
We lost sight of the dogs almost from the beginning but we could hear them breaking through STRANGE STORIES the underbrush short distance ahead of us while they gave voice almost continuously to their deepthroated baying
For nearly mile we pushed on without anyone uttering word the silence around us broken only by the crackle of twigs and the baying of the dogs now farther distant
Then of sudden their baying gave place to excited yelping interspersed with highpitched whining noises
Theyve found him
the sheriff exclaimed and broke into run
KNOW practically nothing about bloodhounds but had pre monition the moment their tone changed that everything was not go ing according to schedule
No dog regardless of his breed ever indulges in that highpitched whine when everything is running entirely to his satisfaction
glanced at Patton and saw the same suspicion reflected on his face
By this time we had come out upon deep gully whose opposite wall was broken by the yawning black ness of caves mouth
The dogs had already crossed this gulley and were now yelping and whining in front of the cave
Gosh Almighty
He must be in there
the sheriff exclaimed and started scrambling down the steep side of the ravine
Whod have thought Equally puzzled the rest of us fol lowed
We all knew about the cave of course but no one had thought to search it because it was known to be the abode of bats and small but very disagreeable snakes
Ed Stanton would never have gone in there alive and he could not have got there dead
But Dr Morse now might be an other story Patton had forged on ahead of the rest of us and was standing over the dogs when we came up
lheyve got something cornered in there but they wont go in after it he announced
Ive never known them to act like this before
dont understand it
The sheriff went over and held up his lantern so that its light pene trated some ten or twelve feet into the cave
The dogs came straight here without seemin to lose the trail he commented so Morse must be inside
Shall we go in
Someone in the crowd offered an objection
Maybe theres wild ani mal in there
If the dogs wont go in But Patton scouted the suggestion
Theres no animal in this part of the country that these dogs are afraid of he declared
Still Ill admit theres something strange about the way theyre acting
He made final effort to induce the dogs to lead the way into the cave but without success
They only cowered upon their bellies and whined gazing pleadingly at him with their large intelligent eyes
Its no use he announced
Either well have to go in without them or we stay out
The sheriff gave hitch to his belt and stepped almost casually into the cave entrance
All right he drawled
All them that wants come along
Them that dont can wait where they are
There was momentary hesitancy on the part of few individuals but eventually everyone followed him into the dark opening
We advanced about fifty or sixty feet without making any sort of dis covery
few bats disturbed by the glare of our lanterns darted blindly about our heads but that was all
Then suddenly the sheriff stopped
Look he commanded and pointed downward
There in the thin sticky mould that covered the damp rock of the floor was human footprint
Instantly an excited babbling of speculation broke out among us
It was quite obvious that the footprint had been made within the past twentyfour hours since as yet none of the microscopic green algae plants had begun to form within it
There fore it had almost certainly been made by Dr Morse
Further searching revealed more footprints in fact two sets of them the one superimposed upon the other
From the presence of the algae in THE BOX FROM THE STARS the earlier set it was plain that it had been made at least several days before the second
It looks as if Morse and Stanton might both have come this way whispered to Chatham as we began to move forward again
He nodded
In the ruddy glow of the lanterns his face appeared wor ried
Thats what dont like about it Wilder he replied
What could have brought both of those men to this same cave and why did neither of them come out
It almost seems as if sudden startled shout from one of the men up ahead interrupted me
he was crying pointing trembling arm as he spoke
Look over there on that ledge
We all looked in the direction he indicated where ledge of rock ex cept for narrow crevice some two feet wide opening into unexploited blackness formed the back of the cave
Perched facing us upon this ledge and seeming to stare at us with unblinking lusterless eyes were two human figures
The sheriff took quick step for ward then almost dropped his lan tern
Merciful God
he gasped
Its Ed Stanton and Doctor Morse
So it was
The faces of the two men bore no marks of physical change or disfigurement yet in some subtle way they had altered so that at first glance we had been unable to recognize them
number of the men went over and lifted them down
Both bodies were limp and clammy but to our surprise they were not dead
Get them out of here and into the open the sheriff ordered
Maybe we can bring them around
Four men took up the inert bur dens and we started back the way we had come
Two of the younger fellows however lingered behind the others
wonder where that crack leads to heard one of them mutter to the other
Id like But was too interested in the condition of Morse and Stanton to pay any further attention
was to wish later that had
The two bodies were placed upon the ground at the entrance to the cave and the local doctor who for tunately was one of the party bent over them
cant make it out he reported after brief examination
It looks like catalepsy except that theres no rigidity
Wed better get them to hospital at once
While crude stretchers were being improvised from coats Chatham drew me aside
Wilder did you ever see Cre tin
he asked lowering his voice so that none of the others might over hear
No answered wondering why he should bring up such subject at this time cant say that have
Well have he went on and except for the physical deformation that accompanies cretinism the faces have the same blank mindless look that these two have
But what never finished my question
From the interior of the cave arose sudden wild shriek of terror followed by hideous mouth ing and gibbering that was distinctly not human
remembered the two men who had lingered behind
SNATCHING lantern dashed for the mouth of the cave fol lowed closely by Chatham and one or two others
It took me almost no time at all to reach the place where we had found Morse and Stanton but in those few minutes the sounds that had sum moned us had subsided into low jabbering like the chattering of monkey
And they were coming from beyond the crevice at the back of the cave
Holding the lantern high above my head started toward the narrow opening
But before could reach it man staggered out and all but col lapsed in my arms
He was Jim Lentz one of the two who had re mained behind
Something in there he muttered thickly
Got Hellman no use
going in
too late
STRANGE STORIES Then he fainted
do not lay any claims to bravery for actually pressing on into that dark passageway
It was the sheer excitement of the moment that drove me leaving no room for fear
Still holding the lantern in front of me sidled along the crevice for about six feet
Abruptly found myself in another cave
It was much smaller than the first so that the light of the lantern pene trated into practically all of it at once
As the ruddy rays sent the black shadows scuttling back among the uneven prominences and fissures that marked the walls and ceiling experienced curious sensation which am wholly unable to describe
Al though realize how ridiculous the words may sound can say only that it was as though some over powering force had collided with my mind
The impression was only momen tary and was gone with the retreat ing shadows
But instantly second shock this time wholly explicable took its place
For groveling upon the middle of the rock floor and mouthing horribly like some mad animal was the figure of Hellman
heard an exclamation behind me and realized that Chatham had fol lowed me through the narrow pass age
Merciful God
he choked
Hes gone mad
ground between clenched teeth
We must get him out of here
set the lantern upon projecting rock and Chatham and flung our selves upon Hellman
He had paid no attention to us until he felt our hands upon him then he began to fight with the strength of maniac
In the end we were forced to knock him unconscious before we were able to drag him from the cave
When he came to he was still in that savage bestial state he had to be taken to an asylum
TEXT day we heard Lentzs story Xl of what had taken place
set it down here as nearly as can in his own words We were about to leave the cave with the rest of you he told group of us when Hellman sug gested that we stay and see where that little opening at the back led to
wasnt so keen about it but when he laughed and said was afraid gave in
He had the lantern and so he went first while followed close be hind
The passage was so narrow that we had to go sideways and the first thing knew my coat had caught on sharp rock so that had to stop to get it loose
Hellman must have thought that wasnt coming for he made grab for me
As he did that he somehow dropped the lantern and it went out
He paused and passed trembling hand over his face
It was plain that what he had to relate filled him with almost unendurable horror
Its hard to explain what happened next he went on after minute for dont exactly know myself
All of sudden he let go of me and staggered backwards
Then he let out the most awful yell Ive ever heard
At first thought hed fallen into pit or something and called out to him to ask what was wrong
He didnt answer me with words but he began to make those awful noises like like an animal or something
There were sounds of thrashing about too but they werent so much like two men or even man and an animal struggling together as like one man fighting with himself
tried to go to help him but all of sudden couldnt move
It was as if everything Id ever been afraid of without giving name to it had taken form in there
If any of you fellows were ever scared of the dark when you were kids youll know what mean
It was like that only hundred times worse
And all the time Hellman kept making those terrible noises not so loud as at first but more and more like an animal
Then heard somebody coming and managed to get out to them
guess thats all know
That afternoon the sheriff and sev eral others searched both parts of the cave with powerful electric THE BOX FROM THE STARS torches
They found absolutely noth ing but the sheriff in telling us about it afterwards concluded with strange statement
was the last one to leave the inner cave he said and just as stepped into that narrow passage that connects the two funny thing happened
All of sudden had the same feeling that Jake Mills had had in the woods the night after Ed Stanton disappeared the feeling of something staring at the back of my head
It fairly made the chills go over me for knew there wasnt living thing back there
Ive notion to ask the county commissioners either to have that place sealed up or better yet dynamited
CHAPTER IV The Gunthorp Theory ITH the finding of Stanton and Dr Morse and the insan ity of Hellman the newspapers which had hitherto given the disap pearances only passing notice now broke out with headlines
Naturally this resulted in an army of curiosity seekers who had to be kept away from the cave by an armed guard but it was also indirectly responsible for bringing about the solution to the whole mysterious affair for it brought back Prof Gunthorp
He presented himself unannounced at our shack sarcastic and snappy as ever
Well see youve done nothing toward clearing this mess up he an nounced abruptly so came my self
Chatham made some illadvised re mark about not seeing how the hap penings at the cave could come under the province of archeology
The pro fessor shot him withering glance
You wouldnt he snapped
suppose you and Wilder are ready to subscribe to Morses ghost theory
Still he added as if on second thought that man may have been nearer to the right track than he realized
shame he didnt make any sort of notes before the thing got him
But he did
exclaimed sud denly remembering the notebook that had promised the sheriff to trans late
Here they are
He fairly pounced upon the little book
You blithering idiots
he cried
If you had examined this that last poor devil Hellman might not have been sacrificed
Now get out while see what Morse had to say
All the rest of that morning he was occupied with laboriously trans cribing Dr Morses cramped short hand
By the middle of the after noon he had completed the task and was ready to share what he had learned with Chatham and me
Well skip over the first few pages he announced since they consist of nothing but Morses idiotic theories
Funny how an otherwise sane man will cling to worn out superstitions when he can find wholly satisfactory explanation of the facts in the laws of higher phys ics
But let that go you probably wouldnt understand it anyway
He leafed jerkily over one or two more pages
This next is an hourly record of his first nights vigil he continued and consists mainly of the words Nothing so far so we can skip that too
But here is his record of the second night up to the point where he was attacked
He cleared his throat and began to read aloud Eight It is fairly dark now so will begin my record for to night although really cannot hope for any genuine phenomenon for some hours yet
Still for the sake of science it is best to be on the safe side
The woods are very still but no more so than they should be ordi narily
Again shall endeavor to work without light since light of any kind seems to be antagonistic to psychic forces
Nine Nothing yet
The trees and bushes on all sides are loud with the voices of night insects
It seems almost impossible that such STRANGE STORIES tiny creatures can make so much noise
am beginning to believe that the true intensity of sound is to be measured only by the intensity of the silence that surrounds it
Ten Either some of the insects have gone to sleep or am growing accustomed to their minia ture racket
probably did not notice this last night because was still too new at this type of vigil
am making this entry half hour earlier because believe that soon will have some sort of success
The insects are nearly all quiet now circumstance which am positive did not occur last night
But it is not merely this cessation of ordinary night noises that leads me to believe am about to experience some kind of psychic phenomenon
There is decided feel ing of tension in the air such as is noticeable just prior to severe elec trical storm yet the sky wherever it is visible through the trees is en tirely cloudless and rny little barom eter which examined moment ago with my flashlight shows no in dication of falling weather
Ten fortyfive
was right
force of some sort is gathering out side my tent
As the man Mills described can feel eyes upon me but they are not human eyes
will make ray mind receptive to whatever may be coming
Eleven It is here in the tent with me and must fight it off
My God
It is horrible
can neither see it nor hear it and yet it has taken hold of me
If the cold arm of an octopus could reach into my mind it would be like that
It is too strong for me
Gunthorp looked up from the note book
The writing breaks off here in meaningless scrawl he said
The Power must have overcome him
CHATHAM and had been listen ing openmouthed
But what power
asked incredulously
If it was something he could neither see nor hear nor apparently even feel tangibly what was it
Gunthorp shot me an enigmatic glance through his thicklensed spec tacles
Hasnt it dawned upon you even now
he asked
But Chatham was leaning forward his red hair bristling with excite ment
Professor he exclaimed
That day we opened the box the feeling of mental shock
The professors bald head nodded
The box
He paused to enjoy the little dra matic moment he had created then he went on It was theory of the early phys icists and pseudophysicsts Paracel sus in particular that atoms were of two classes the heavier and inert composing matter the lighter and more active composing mind
Of course such an idea went into the discard even before the subdivi sions of the atom were discovered but it is my belief that Paracelsus came nearer to the truth than even he realized
If as Millikan suggests all mat ter is merely form of energy and my own experiments tend to bear this out then it is quite possible that the thing which we call mind or mental force is form of this energy
Whether the process of thought is its ordered releasing through the material chemistry of the brain or whether it is an independent quantity that acts through the brain need not concern us now
The important point is that such quantity should be able to exist in the free state the same as any other of the known ele ments
If am right then some sort of entity made up of this pure energy was imprisoned in the box which you found embedded in the meteor
Dont ask me how or by whom for those are questions beyond our power to answer
But when the box was opened this force was released to go about preying upon other mental forces just as we feed our material bodies with other material bodies
Do you follow me
We did after fashion although the idea behind his words seemed al most too fantastic for credence
Chatham was running his fingers through his hair as if to aid in as THE BOX FROM THE STARS similating the professors startling statement
But it isnt logical
he finally burst out
If the thing feeds upon mental power how did it manage to keep alive during all those hundreds of thousands of years that it was im prisoned in the box
Perhaps feeds is an illchosen word Gunthorp admitted
The en tity if we can call it such could exist indefinitely without nourish ment because it is composed of pure force and force is indestructible
It may be more accurate to liken it to large blob of mercury which when liberated will draw smaller globules into itself
We considered this in silence then But if this thing remains at large it will go about attacking others as it attacked Stanton and Morse and later Hellman
exclaimed in hor ror
Why if it isnt stopped it isnt beyond the bounds of possibility that it will eventually absorb into itself all the mental power of the world
Is there no way to stop it or destroy it
Destroy it no Gunthorp an swered gravely
However it is pos sible that we may be able to trans mute it so that it will be rendered harmless and that is what we must try to do
It has long been tenet of phys ics that force or energy is produced by the destruction of matter
In other words matter which is made up of minute particles may be changed into energy which is of wave composition
But recent experi ment with light for example have shown that it possesses the character istics of both particles and waves
This leads to the conclusion that the two are but different forms of the same thing and therefore inter changeable
But what has all that to do Chatham began but the professor cut him short
Think the old mans raving again do you
he snapped
Well hes not
What Im getting at if you had the brains to see it is that its as logical to convert energy into matter as it is to convert matter into en ergy
Your energy transformer
ex claimed remembering his work at the University and suddenly seeing the light
Exactly he replied
Of course cant guarantee that the thing will work satisfactorily since its still largely in the experimental stage
But at least we can try
If it fails He shrugged
Well we will have to think of something else
CHAPTER The Reversal of Nature THAT evening Gunthorp sent off long wire to his assistant or dering the shipment of several pieces of apparatus from his laboratory
Two days later the equipment ar rived whole truckload of it
Gun thorp did not unpack it but directed his assistant who had brought it per sonally to drive it down to the mouth of the cave
Well have to carry it piece by piece into the outer cave and set it up there he announced
Id prefer to have it in the inner cave but it would be impossible to get it through that narrow passage
The best we can do is coax the entity out to us
But how
asked practically
You leave that to me was his only answer
It took us the better part of week to set the machinery up to his satisfaction
During all of our opera tions we kept the cave brightly lighted with number of kerosene lamps for as Gunthorp pointed out the thing we were fighting struck only in darkness indicating that there was some property in light that drove it off
But even with the protection of the lamps it was eerie enough working in that ghostly bat hung cavern knowing that just be yond the narrow passage in the inner chamber something lurked in wait STRANGE STORIES something that fed upon mens minds
will not attempt to describe the energy transformer other than to say that it bore rough resemblance to those elaborate mechanisms used in experiments to smash the atom but built on much smaller scale
It worked Gunthorp explained by changing the lengthwise undulation of energy waves to sidewise or cross vibration which would bring about the transformation of pure energy into free atoms
When at last everything was in readiness Gunthorp gave Chatham and me our final instructions
want you both to listen care fully and to do
exactly as tell you he began
His usual fussy bumptiousness was gone now and he seemed unnaturally grave
When we go into the cave we will extin guish all the lanterns
Otherwise the thing will not come out where we are
Then you Wilder will start the generator while go to the entrance of the narrow passage that leads to the inner cave
But Professor broke in do you realize what that means
Youll be placing yourself in the position of human decoy to that monstrosity
Yes yes know he snapped with momentary return of his old irritability
But the thing must be lured out somehow and thats the only way can think of
However there will be little danger if Chat ham does precisely what tell him
What do you want me to do
Chatham asked little uneasily
want you to stand by the pro jector Gunthorp explained
As soon as you hear me utter sound either an intelligible word or other wise you will release the trans former beam
Leave it on for five minutes
If at the end of that time have not returned to shut it off you must both get out of the cave as fast as you can
And leave you there
Chatham exclaimed
Not if Be quiet you young idiot Gun thorp interrupted testily
Youll do as tell you
know what Im about
His tone precluded further argu ment
We followed him obediently into the cave
One after another the lanterns were extinguished until only one re mained
Chatham held it until Gun thorp had taken up his position at the entrance to the passage then it too was put out For what seemed an eternity we stood there in the darkness waiting
Somewhere in that darkness we knew malignant entity lurked something that fed upon mens minds and cast aside their bodies like dis carded husks
To my overexcited imagination it seemed that this in visible horror was creeping up on me from all sides at once and felt myself shrinking as if from physi cal contact
Abruptly Gunthorps voice came to us out of the blackness Now
he hissed
Release the ray
With feeling of relief that the suspense of waiting was over and definite action about to begin heard Chatham throw the switch
The next instant HOW shall ever describe what followed
There was no flash for the condenser ray was invisible nor was there any sound other than the steady hum of the generator
But suddenly the air around us became charged with the straining tension of mighty struggle
force that was intelligent but not tangible had been caught in the grip of manmade force against which it was now fight ing for its life
For nearly four minutes by the radium dial of my wrist watch the battle raged seeming all the more terrible because it was not physical
The air seemed to boil and swell like water churned up by the thrash ing of seaserpent in its death agony
And then at last when it seemed that we ourselves must be crushed by the mighty force of the conflict something snapped
Of sudden the tension was dissipated while the re lieved atmosphere appeared to col lapse like the sides of balloon from THE BOX FROM THE STARS which the straining gases have been released
The struggle was over
Someone was groping toward the projector
It was Gunthorp recog nized his voice as he stumbled over some piece of apparatus in the dark ness
Professor are you all right
called anxiously
Of course Im all right came his tart reply
Cant one of you idiots make light before break my neck
Here let me Chatham offered
He struck match
There was burst of flame accom panied by terrific explosion
The walls of the cave rocked around us and rocks and dirt were rained down upon us
One large sized rock struck me upon the head When regained consciousness was lying upon my bunk back in Chathams and my shack
Gunthorp was bending over me
For the first time since had known him sur prised an expression almost of ten derness in his eyes
Are you all right boy
he asked
How do you feel
Oh guess Ill live grinned trying to ignore the pain in my head
Tell me what happened
It was all my fault Chatham put in
That match struck It was my fault for being an old fool Gunthorp cut him short
should have known better than to have used the converter without test ing its strength first
You see he explained the ray was much stronger than had antic pated
Thus instead of converting the energy entity into free electrons it condensed it into hydrogen atoms the lowest step in the atomic scale
Then when at my direction Chat ham struck match He made an expressive gesture
The highly inflammable nature of hydrogen did the rest Chatham fin ished
It took the roof off the cave just above where you were standing and dropped piece of it down on your head
With start sat up unmindful of the dizzying throbbing in my head
Good Lord
cried in alarm
If the thing was converted into hy drogen and the hydrogen exploded then it was turned back into energy again
know Gunthorp nodded
But this time it was scattered by the force of the explosion and can do no damage
Or at least he added grimly so hope
And so far it seems that he is right
It is more than probable that the entity torn apart by the explo sion was rendered utterly powerless
Or if it was not it apparently prof ited by its bitter experiences in the world of men and fled back to the distant stars from which it came orig inally
But that is something suppose we shall never know
God keep us from such things
We need more mind in the world not less

HE WAS found in the room cure written confession
Perhaps with his wife slightly con the Police Department felt it was fused trifle bewildered too plain case
At least it was but otherwise apparently normal
He handled intelligently and in most made no effort to conceal his con scientific manner
The man was well duct any more than he did to the knife fed carefully bedded and the next in his hand or the pieces in the morning after being bathed and trunk
shaved was taken to see psychi Fortunately the inspector was an atrist
officer of more than usual intelli The specialist in mental diseases gence and there was no effort made had the man comfortably seated to give the third degree or even se Knowing he smoked he offered THE DEAD WOMAN cigar which was accepted
Then in quiet pleasant atmosphere he made one statement and one request
am sure Mr Thompson that you had an excellent reason for act ing as you did the other day
wish you would tell me all about it
THE man gazed at the psychiatrist
Will you believe me if tell you
will accept every part of your story with the idea that you are con vinced that you are telling me the truth
That is all want whispered Thompson
If everyone talked to in the past had done that if they had even tried to check up on my story perhaps this would not have happened
But they always thought that was the sick one and there was not one who was willing to ac cept my statement about the worms
suppose that was happily mar ried
At least as much so as most men are
You know that there is good deal of conflict between the sexes and there were few differ ences of opinion between Mrs Thompson and myself
But not enough to cause serious difficulty
Will you remember that
That we did not quarrel very much
About year ago my wifes health began to give me considerable cause for worry
She started to fail
If you are married man Doctor you know there is always that anxiety about the wifes health
You become ac customed to living with woman having her do things for you go to places with you and you think about how life would be if she should sicken and die
Perhaps the fact that you are uneasy about the future makes you exaggerate the importance of her symptoms
At any rate she became sick de veloped nasty cough and lost weight
spoke to her about it and even bought bottle of beef wine and iron at the drug store and made her take it
She did so to please me but she never would admit that she was sick
Said it was fashionable to be thin and that the cough was just nervousness
She would not go to see doctor
When spoke to her mother about it the old lady just laughed at me said that if tried to make Lizzie little happier she would soon get fat
In fact none of our family or our friends seemed to feel that there was anything wrong with Mrs Thomp son so stopped talking about it
Of course it was not easy on me the way she coughed at night and her staying awake so much
work hard in the daytime and it is hard to lose lot of sleep
At last was forced to ask her to let me sleep in the spare bedroom
Even that did not help much
could hear her cough and when she did fall asleep would have to tip toe into her room and see if she was all right
Her coughing bothered me so much that when she did not cough it worried me more because thought something had happened to her
One night the thing was afraid of happened
She had hard spell of coughing and then she stopped
It was quiet in the house
could hear the clock on the landing tick and mouse gnawing wood in the attic
thought could even hear my own heart beat but there was not sound of any kind from the other bedroom
When went in there and turned on the light just knew it was all over
Of course was not sure
bookkeeper is not supposed to be an expert in such matters so went and telephoned for our doctor
On the way to the phone wondered just what should say for he had always insisted that my wife was in grand health
So simply told him that Mrs Thompson was not looking well and would he come over
Just like that told him and tried to keep my voice steady
It was about an hour before he came
He went into the bedroom but stopped at the doorway
He spent sometime listening to her heart and feeling her pulse and then he straightened up and said to me She is fine
Just fast asleep
wish could sleep as soundly as that
What did you think was wrong
That surprised me so much that all could do was to stammer some STRANGE STORIES thing about not hearing her cough any more
He laughed
You worry too much about her Mr
Right there my difficulty started
Here was doctor who was supposed to know his business and he said there was nothing wrong with my wife and there was just book keeper and just knew what was the matter
What was to do
Tell him that he was wrong
Send for another physician
It was growing light by that time so went down to the kitchen and started the coffee
often did that
Then shaved and made ready to go to the office
But before went sat down while by the wifes bed
It bothered me but had to keep telling myself that the doctor knew better than did
MEFORE leaving the house MM phoned to my motherinlaw
Just told her that Lizzie was not feel ing well and would she come over and spend the day and she could get me at the office any time she called
Then left the house
It felt better out in the sunshine and after work ing few hours over the books al most laughed at myself for being so foolish
No telephone calls from the old lady
arrived home at six and found the house lighted as usual
My wife and motherinlaw were waiting for me in the parlor and told me supper was ready
Naturally was surprised to see my wife out of bed
At the supper table watched her just as carefully as could without making the two of them suspicious of me
Mrs Thompson ate about as she usually did just pieced and minced at her food but thought when she swallowed that the food went down with jerk and there was stiffness when she moved
But her mother did not seem to think there was anything wrong at least she did not make any comment
Even when went with her to the front door to say good night to her and we were alone there she never said word to show that she thought her daughter was peculiar
started to wash the dishes after that
often washed the dishes at night while the wife sat in the front parlor watching the people go up and down past the house
After the kitchen was tidy lit cigar and went into the parlor and started little conversation but Mrs Thomp son never talked back
In fact do not believe she ever talked to me after that though am positive that she talked to the others
When the cigar was smoked just said good night and went to bed
Later could hear her moving around in her room and then all was quiet so she must have gone to bed
She did not cough any more
congrat ulated myself on that one thing be cause the coughing had kept me awake good deal
During the night lit candle and shading it with my hand tip toed in to see her
She had her eyes open but they were rolled back so all you could see was the whites and she was not breathing
At least could not tell that she was breath ing and when held mirror in front of her mouth there was no vapor on it
My mother had told me the purpose of that when was boy
The next day was just the same
My motherinlaw came and spent the day
came home at night and ate supper with them and washed the dishes
The water was hot and it was pleasure to make them clean
Perhaps took longer than usual at it because did not fancy the idea of going into the front parlor where the wife was sitting looking out of the window
But went in tonight without the usual cigar
wanted to use my nose
It seemed there was peculiar odor in the house like flowers that had been put in vase of water and then forgotten for many days
Per haps you know the odor Doctor heavy one like lilies of the valley in small closed room
It was specially strong in the parlor where Mrs Thompson was sitting and it seemed to come from her
had to light the cigar after while and by and by said good night and went to bed
She THE DEAD WOMAN never spoke to me in fact she did not seem to pay any attention to me
About two that morning took the candle and went in to look at her
Her eyelids were open and her eyeballs were rolled back just like they had been the night before but now her jaw was dropped and her cheeks sunk in
just could not do anything but telephone for doctor and this time picked out total stranger just picked his name out of the telephone book haphazard
What good did it do
None at all
He came he examined Mrs Thompson very carefully and he simply said that he did not see any thing wrong with her and then down in the front hall he turned on me and asked me just why had sent for him and what thought was the matter with her
Of course just could not tell him the truth with his being doctor and being just bookkeeper
MBY motherinlaw went to the YM
mountains next day for the summer and that left us alone
Break fast as usual and to the office and not word all day from the house
When came back at night the house was lit and supper was on the table and the wife at her end as usual and the food served and on the plates
She ate but her movements were slower and when she swallowed you could see the food go down by jerks and her eyes were sunken into the sockets and seemed shiny and well like the eyes of fish on the stalls
There were flowers on the table but the smell was something differ ent it was sweeter and when took deep breath it was just hard for me to go on eating the pork chops and potatoes
You see it was summer time and warm and in spite of the screens there was fly or two in the house and when saw one walking around on her lip and she not mak ing any effort to brush it off just couldnt keep on eating
Had to go and start washing the dishes
Per haps you can understand how felt Doctor
Things looked rather odd
The next day phoned to the office that would not be there and sent for taxi and took Mrs Thompson to first class specialist
He must have been good because he charged me twentyfive dollars just for the office call
went in first and told him just exactly what was afraid of and did not mince my words and then we had the wife in
He examined her even her blood and all the satisfaction got was that she seemed trifle anaemic but that had better take nerve tonic and vacation or would be sick
Things looked rather twisted after that
Either was right and every body else wrong or they were right and was just about as wrong men tally as man could be
But had to believe my senses
man just has to believe what he sees and hears and feels and when thought over that office visit and the wife smiling and the doctor sticking her finger for the blood to examine it just seemed im possible
Why that was simple word to describe her con dition
That night the flies were worse than usual
went to the corner store and bought fly spray and used it in her bedroom but they kept coming in the big blue ones you know
Seemed as though they just had to come in and could not keep them off her face so at last in des peration covered her head up with towel and went to sleep
had to work the interest on the mortgage was due and the man wanted some thing on the principal and it was good house and all had in the world to show for twenty years of hard work keeping books
The next day was just like all the days had been except that made more mistakes with the books and my boss spoke to me about it
And when arrived home supper was not ready though Mrs Thompson was in the parlor and the lights on
The heavy odor was worse than usual and there were lot of flies
You could hear them buzz and strike against the electric lights
got my own supper but couldnt eat much thinking of her in the parlor and the flies settling on her open mouth
STRANGE STORIES She just sat there that night in the parlor till went to her and took her arm to lead her up the stairs
She was cold and on each cheek there was heavy purple blotch forming
Once she was in her room she seemed to move around so left her alone and when went into her room later on she was in bed
It had been hard week for me so sat down by her bed and tried to think but the more thought the worse things seemed
The night was hot and the flies kept buzzing just thinking of the past and how we used to go to the movies together and laugh and sometimes come near cry ing and how we used to bluff about the fact that perhaps it was just as well we didnt have child so long as we had each other knowing all the time that she was eating her heart out for longing to be mother and blaming me for her loneliness
The thinking was too much for me so thought might as well smoke another cigar and go to bed and try to keep better books the next day and hold my job and then saw the little worm crawl out
Right then and there knew that something had to be done
It didnt make any difference what the doctors or her mother said something had to be done and was the one who had to do it
telephoned for an undertaker
Met him downstairs
Tt will be private funeral told him and no publicity and think after you are through you will have no trouble obtaining physi cians certificate
He went up stairs
In about five minutes he came down stairs
must have gone to the wrong room he said
The second story front bedroom replied
But the woman there is not dead he said
paid him for his trouble and shut the door in his face
Was helpless
Doctor you have to be lieve me
was at the end of my rope
had tried every way knew and there was not anything left to do
No one believed me
No one agreed with me
It seemed more and more as though they thought was insane
WWT WAS impossible to keep her in the house longer
My health was giving way
Woricmg all day at figures that were going wrong all the time and coming back night after night cooking my supper and sleep ing in room next to the thing that had been my wife
What with the smell of lilies of the valley and the buzz of flies and the constant dread in my mind of how things would be the next day and the next week and the mortgage due
had to do some thing
And it seemed to me that she wanted me to
It seemed that she recognized that things were not right that she was entitled to dif ferent kind of an ending
tried to put myself in her place and knew what would want done with me if things were reversed
So brought the trunk up from the cellar
We had used that trunk on our wedding trip and every sum mer since on our vacations and thought that she would be more at peace in that trunk than in new one
But when had the trunk by her bed saw at once that it was too small unless used knife
That seemed to be the proper thing to do and was sure that it would not hurt her
For days she had been past hurting
told her was sorry but it just had to be done and if people had just believed me things could have been arranged in nicer way
Then started
Things were confused after that
seem to remember scream and blood spurting and the next thing there were lot of people in the house and they arrested me
And that is the peculiar part of it all Doctor
Perhaps you do not know it but am accused of murder ing my wife
Now have told you all about it Doctor and just want to ask you one question
If you had been in my place day after day and night after night what would you have done Doctor
What would any man have done who loved his wife
The Vengeance of Ai The Ancient Goddess of the Chaldeans Stilt Exacts Tribute in the Valley of the Moon
By MARK SCHORER Author of Portrait of Ladies etc
Do you see them running running WHEN Margaret Levering left me in London she said There is something that cant wait out there Peter
knew that whatever she implied had to do with her father then four months dead but Margaret would tell me nothing more
She went on to Cairo alone as she wished
But when six weeks parsed with only the brief and strained notes from her knew something was wrong and followed her
At the Hotel Continental in Cairo late one afternoon in October had barely finished bathing when boy appeared with sealed note for me although had informed no one of my arrival
ripped it open and read Dear Mr Harris understand you have just come from London and assume you are led here by your interest in the welfare of Margaret Levering the now Lady Warrender who STRANGE STORIES is in Cairo at the Hotel Memphis and who has more than once spoken of you
Please be so good as not to refer in any way to her father the late Lord Warrender nor to his recent excavations and unfortunate death in the Valley of the Moon
should be glad to talk this unusual request over with you as between mutual friends of Lady Warrender if you should so desire
May respectfully urge you to see me before you see Lady Warrender
You will find me in Room of this hotel
Ask for Ernest Lumsden
Ernest Lumsden
had never heard of him Be so good as not to refer in any way to her father he had written
Why not
Margaret was perfectly aware of her fathers excavations and knew almost as much of arche ology anthropology and Egyptology as he had known himself
Why make no mention of something that had been headlined in every newspaper and journal in the English speaking world
Lord Warrender had been crushed to death by falling statue in the templetomb of Ai Goddess of the Moon
remembered again in my hotel room how bravely Margaret had taken his death
They were adventurers those two and the true adventurer is always ready to meet what Provi dence may have in store for him
knocked loudly at number
The door opened almost immediately and found myself confronted by an elderly gentleman whose not unkind face was lined with wrinkles
His hair was sparse and white yet he could not have been much over fifty
May see Mr
in quired
am Mr Lumsden
Come in
Thank you
walked past him into the room
When he had closed the door again he turned to me
Peter Har ris
he asked
nodded curtly
It was good of you to come
He turned slightly and indicated youngish man whom had not no ticed before
Allow me to present the Sheikh AlJubal Mr Peter Har ris
The Egyptian wore white drill suit and carried cane except for the turban binding his swarthy head he might easily have been mis taken for an Englishman browned by the hot African sun
The Sheikh Al Jubal bowed
TURNED to Lumsden again
confess that found your note surprising said
May know its meaning
Lord Warrender was my best friend Lumsden began quietly his eyes steadily on me
Had so much as set foot in London in the past twenty years you would no doubt have known of me before this
As dear friend of her late father am naturally interested in Lady War render
The Sheikh AlJubal he went on indicating once more the silent Egyptian also knew her father well
His intimate acquaintance with the history and present state of the Valley of the Moon proved invalu able to Lord Warrender in his work here
During an acquaintance that was at first matter of convenience these two came to regard each other with deep respect and friendship
He paused
hope you can see Harris that in us you have two friends interested only in Lady Warrenders welfare
The old mans manner and speech convinced me of his integrity
appreciate that said
Good he said nodding abruptly
Do you know the history of the tombs in the Valley of the Moon
he asked
Im afraid dont
My knowledge of Egyptology is practically nil and in these more unusual matters con fess know nothing at all
Lumsden turned to the Sheikh
Tell him AlJubal
The Sheikh addressed me for the first time since our introduction
looked at this dark man with the heavy black beard the beetling brows the thin lips
He spoke in low pleasant voice
Ai the Moon Goddess is not THE VENGEANCE OF AI Egyptian yet she is the goddess of that accursed valley worshiped and revered by many of our natives even today
He paused as if searching for point at which to begin and pres ently went on
Long years ago wealthy Chal dean merchant left his native land for Egypt
He came personally to barter his finest wares with Egypts princes and his stay was climaxed by his fortunate marriage to an Egyp tian lady of quality
The family founded by that mar riage was one of the richest and most influential during that whole period and the wealthy merchant found Egypt so to his liking that he made his home here as many others have done since
When he died the question of burial arose
Despite his family and his impor tance he was not Egyptian
He de sired burial under the protection of his own gods
So tomb was built in what has since been called the Valley of the Moon
There his mummy was laid
And though he was the only for eigner in that resting place Ai Chaldean Goddess of the Moon con tinued as the protecting deity of the valley and of the people buried there
In the innermost chamber of that first tomb in the valley there is colossal statue of Ai
Around her neck is suspended giant pectoral of gold an eightraed disk symbol of the divine power of Ai
These facts were brought to light by Lord Warrender
His labor had brought him to this inner chamber and it was there that his work was so un fortunately cut short
The Egyptian ceased abruptly and settled back
Was it that statue that crushed him
Lumsden nodded
Yes it was the great statue of Ai that toppled from its base and killed Lord Warrender in its fall
The accident occurred when he attempted to remove the golden amulet from the neck of the colossus
Isnt it odd that statue of that size should topple
No one thought of that until the Sheikh and got to looking into the matter said Lumsden
Lord War render had spoken of the statue to us pointing out that it was attached very firmly to its base
So firmly indeed that he made much of the fact that it would be extremely diffi cult to do anything with it
Yet the next day it fell crushing him
Could Lord Warrender have been deceived
Perhaps it only seemed firmly attached
LUMSDEN shrugged his shoulders but the look on his face showed his scorn for my suggestion that Lord Warrender might have been in error
Perhaps you will think that we too were deceived when the Sheikh and found the statue of Ai re stored to its base when we visited the tomb after Warrenders burial
Before could reply the Sheikh AlJubal cut in suddenly There were other things
Do not forget them Lumsden
Mr Harris perhaps thinks that worshiping natives crept into the templetomb at night and righted the statue
Lumsden spread his hands
Yes he said perhaps he does
As mat ter of fact that was exactly what had been thinking
But Lumsden went on Id almost forgotten there were other things
The terror of the natives when they saw the statue of Ai and the eightrayed moondisk and their sub sequent flight
They were afraid of something screamed out something about curse and went positively frantic when Lord Warrender sug gested removing the amulet from about the neck of the statue
When Lord Warrender went down into the crypt to take the amulet only two white aides were with him
The natives would not go near the tomb nor can any of them be induced to enter the tomb even now
Only the two white men saw the statue topple and fall just as Lord Warrender was about to remove the golden disk and since then one of those two men has STRANGE STORIES died mysterious and unaccountable death
What are you implying
The Sheikh AlJubal interposed
It is not time to beat about the bush he said
The matter is clear for those who wish to see
The desecrator of Ais templetomb is cursed nothing can save him from death
smiled halfheartedly with an in solent superiority which did not quite feel
Am expected to take this seriously
AlJubal frowned impatiently and Lumsden looked irritated
Then the Sheikh spoke again with scornful gesture in my direction
Perhaps Mr Harris will consider more seriously the as yet unexplained death of Lord Warrenders successor Herbert Lanseer
He was found just outside the templetomb of Ai
He seemed to have been beaten or crushed to death
There were strange marks tiie marks of the guardians of Ai those invisible spirits who have been set to guard the Valley of the Moon and those sleeping there
AGAIN felt uneasy
If it was this sort of nonsense
Well what has all this got to do with Lady Warrender
Everything in the world said Lumsden quietly
Lady Warrender is somewhat less skeptical than you
was astounded Do you mean to say that Margaret scientist that she is actually believes her father to have been killed by the vengeance of Ai and that other man Lanseer think you called him
Lumsden looked away sighing gently
Yes he said she believes that and more
She believes much more
There is another native belief which might interest you
And that
asked finding it some what difficult to keep the scorn felt from my voice
The Sheikh spoke again
As Ai cursed her fathers life so has Ai cursed his death
As she avenged her self on his body so she still avenges herself on his invisible soul
She has condemned his spirit by the power of her curse to run always with the guar dians of the valley when they go from tomb to tomb on the night of the full moon
Sometimes Mr Harris they have been seen
Have you seen them
asked sharply
No said Lumsden at once but it is not always necessary to see
came to my feet
took my hat from the table
Thank you said for your kind intentions
But this sounds like pretty tall stuff to me
Im sorry
walked toward the door
But before reached it the door swung open and native garbed in conventional English clothes burst into the room
Something had hap pened that concerned the two men to whom had been speaking for both stared at the stranger with apprehen sive faces
After quick glance at me he addressed Lumsden and the Sheikh
Lattal has been found
Near the tomb where you thought
His head is beaten in like the others Lanseer and Weatherbee
Lumsden and the Sheikh looked at me
felt my confident superiority crumbling
turned from the door looking from Lumsden to the Sheikh
Who is Lattal
asked but already premonition was forming in my mind
Lattal said Lumsden was the other of the two men who saw the statue crush Lord Warrender
Weath erbee was the first
Both of them left their hotel at dead of night without word to anyone
Lattal went as if in daze as if some power outside him self was drawing him away from the city
Is it asking too much of you to believe that Lattals death is linked to the other three by the power of Ais curse
Or do you think these deaths series of remarkable coincidences Mr
It was with confidence was far from feeling that hedged
Stranger coincidences have happened
turned to the door again with an effort
Lumsden was there before me
Xis ten
Harris he said not unkindly know how difficult belief must be for you
understand your attitude
But remember Margaret
You dont real ize the nervous condition this has brought her to
Go to her if you must but do not mention her father
If she THE VENGEANCE OF AI chooses to bring him up herself there is nothing to be done about it
Were trying to keep her mind off it
Were urging her to go back to London
Youve got to help
put out my hand and took his
Theres nothing Id like better than to see Lady Warrender back in Lon don said
You may count on me but as for this super natural business thats out abso lutely
But Margaret will not return until she is convinced that her fathers spirit is not bound to run with the guardians of the templetomb of Ai
Then you yourself do not believe
asked quickly
You misunderstand me Harris
do he replied quietly
But the im portant thing is to convince Margaret that the legend is untrue
He bowed slightly and opened the door
The Sheikh AlJubal raised his hand in farewell gesture
heard Lumsden sigh as walked past him into the hall
went out into the bright streets of Cairo heading for the Hotel Memphis and Margaret
admit that my confi dence was severely shaken something had not cared to show Lumsden and the Sheikh
Yet could not wholly believe in mythical curse
Nor could believe that Margaret so sure of her self and her science Margaret so se rene so rational and urbane could credit the existence of such curse
brushed the suggestion aside looking forward to seeing her again and thought that by Christmas we could be married
looked for Margaret on the green terrace of the Hotel Memphis
moment saw her sitting alone by table just under the wall
Her face was pressed into her hands and her attitude was strangely dejected
walked quickly to where she sat and stopped beside her
She was not aware of me until said Hello
Then she lifted her head slowly and looked up at me
She smiled and came to her feet
Peter you surprised me she cried but her voice was listless
Is that your only welcome
asked gently chiding
Im glad you came Peter so glad
need you
For moment there was intensity in her voice and an unusual emphasis
Perhaps Lumsden had been right after all
Ive come to take you back to Lon don said watching her closely hopefully
She looked at me her face expres sionless
dont know when can go back
watched her face
Under her large hat saw her heavily shadowed eyes the line of strain across her forehead the frightened expression of her lips
Theres something wrong with you my dear said
Cant you tell me what it is
FOR time she said nothing
Yes thought Lumsden was right
She is going to tell about it now
had the uneasy belief that she was going to reiterate everything Lumsden and the Sheikh AlJubal had already told me
You remember Asid my fathers servant who stayed here in Cairo after his death
He was very dear to us
He had always been utterly faithful scrupu lously honest
About week before left London had letter from him
In it he said that there were strange things happening about the tomb Ai in the Valley of the Moon
There were stories of weird ghostly figures running each night the moon rose full Asid had seen them he wrote
And one of them was my father
She trembled little
At first didnt believe it
But it worked on me it grew on me
The idea of the spirit of my father haunt ing the Valley of the Moon together with the native guardian spirits be came so terrible that had to come and will not return to London until have seen with my own eyes that my father is not there
said You dont believe that Mar garet
She looked at me
dont know she said
There are strange things here in Egypt stories of weird unbe lievable curses
brushed this aside impatiently
She broke into speech again
STRANGE STORIES On the night of the last full moor went out there with Asid
He in sisted that come
An old friend of my fathers went along Ernest Lums den
went because wanted to prove to him that there was nothing could be nothing
Mr Lumsden did not want me to go
But went
dont know what it was saw
think it was my father
There was something yes
But perhaps it was because of Asid be lieving in it so strongly
We stood little way from the tomb of Ai
Sud denly he clutched my wrist in his hand pressed it hard in his excite ment and said There
Do you see them Lady running running And thought did naked natives and my father dressed as he was when he died
Peter Ive got to see it through
Tomorrow is another full moon
Im going out there again without Asid
This time Ill make sure
Tomorrow morning early
Ernest Lumsden and the Sheikh AlJubal are going too
And want you to come
need you with me
And if there is nothing
Will you go back to London with me
She nodded
imagine that our cavalcade start ing slowly out of Cairo before dawn the next morning would have seemed an ordinary tourists expedition to the casual observer
He would have seen lady and three men the ladys maid and two guides
Our horses took us out of the gray city and into the shadowed desert
Lumsden went ahead with motor lorry carrying searchlight and tent ing equipment
We hoped to reach the Valley of the Moon before the hot test part of the day though it was good seventy miles out of Cairo
In the desert with Cairo already disap pearing under the dunes behind us the first glimmerings of dawn break ing in the sky our purpose seemed vague and faraway to me
Once at the Valley of the Moon the guides helped us throw up the tents
Water was drawn under the palms that sheltered the tombs and rugs were spread
Then with the guides on guard the rest of us retired to the shelter of our tents and there we rested until the sun had set that night
In the shadowy evening we ate light supper and the guides prepared rugs before the tents for the watch
camp chair was put in place for Margaret to rest on
The sudden night of the desert came down with startling abruptness
Our camp was enshrouded in blackness with the dying campfire nickering near the tents
Sitting there heard the Sheikh AlJubal call to Lumsden Is the searchlight in order
Lumsden called back Yes
Ill take care of it
began to wonder suddenly why searchlight had been brought but my thoughts were diverted by the faint yellow light that came suddenly into being above the edge of the desert and then the rim of the round moon began its slow climb over the horizon
We waited tensely saying little watching for the moment when the moon would be wholly above the sand when the faint reddish glow would strike the entrance to the great tomb of Ai
Mar garet strained forward her eyes fixed on the now hazily lighted row of tombs
There was not sound in the night
felt uneasy
Are you all right dear
whis pered
SHE did not turn but felt her hand on mine
She nodded quickly not wanting to speak
Then suddenly she started forward
she murmured tensely
The moon had topped the desert
looked into her face
At that moment the Sheikh shouted
The light Lumsden
The light And before Margarets eyes were focused on the tomb of Ai again the great white light was trained there moving slowly across the face of the tomb then away down the line of tombs in the Valley of the Moon
sudden wind had come up rushing sound in the night
Slowly the ray moved from tomb to tomb
Margaret leaning forward tensely watching its path
But there was nothing living in its light
Back came the ray again to the great tomb of Ai and once more it de scried circle
There was nothing THE VENGEANCE OF AI and the sudden strange wind died as suddenly as it came
Margaret fell back in her chair
Nothing she murmured
Peter there was nothing
Of course not exulted
Of course not
It was Asid wishing so intensely to believe in his native legends she went on
She turned radiant eyes on me Well start for England this week tomorrow
We turned in to get what sleep we could before our early trek back
But could not sleep
lay for what seemed long time awake in the still ness
And then abruptly heard the sound of hushed voices and the pecu liar padding of feet in the sand
rose on my elbow and listened
Then crept stealthily to the opening in the tent and peered out
Lumsden and the Sheikh were walking rapidly toward the tomb of Ai
In moment was out of the tent and had joined them
ASSUMED readily enough that these two were likewise unable to sleep
wanted to jibe at them for their belief in the legend which had seen disproved yet could not come directly out and speak
Tell me asked after whispered greetings had been exchanged why did you move that searchlight so slowly
It was necessary for me to approxi mate the speed of running men re plied Lumsden without moments hesitation
had to keep them in that blinding light so that she wouldnt see
Good God Lumsden dont tell me you still believe Both he and the Sheikh smiled gent ly
Together we came to stop
Lums dens stick was pointing downward and both Lumsden and AlJubal were looking at the sand
We were standing just outside the great tomb of Ai
looked down
There in the sand knew unmolested by wind for there had been very little wind all that night were little pits as if many feet had been running there
Then cry escaped me
Before me in the center of that run ning line saw single track deeper track track that showed clear and distinct on the wettish sand under the overhanging palm trees the track of feet wearing shoes
Even as looked the Sheikh Al Jubal began methodically to scuff away the traces following the wide circle while Lumsden went back along the trail
All my cocksure confidence had left me
understood that these two were obliterating this definite proof of the curse of Ai so that Mar garet might not see in the morning
Lumsden turned to me
The first part of the task have set for myself is finished Harris
Margaret will re turn to London now and you must go with her
Before leave the Valley of the Moon in the morning am going to try to break the curse that binds Warrenders spirit to the tomb of Ai
Then will help you said rashly
quick glance flashed between the Sheikh and Lumsden
detected ap proval in the Sheikhs eyes and felt strengthened in my resolve
Lumsden did not protest and in consequence witnessed phenomenon which has immeasurably strengthened my belief in the powers of light and darkness
Lumsden and the Sheikh had come prepared
large circle was first drawn in the sand short distance away from the templetomb of Ai and both Lumsden and the Sheikh stepped within
But when made as if to follow them they waved me back
You can help best Harris by mount ing guard over Lady Warrenders tent said Lumsden
You will be able to watch quite clearly and should any thing approach the tent you will be there
did not argue but returned at once to the tent
Nevertheless went back with sharp feeling of disap pointment
took my stand near the opening of Margarets tent and watched the strange ceremony that took place within the circle the Sheikh had drawn in the sand
It was the Sheikh who began the ceremony murmuring cryptic incan tation in his native language
Pres ently the great door of the tomb of Ai began to glow weird reddish fire STEANGE STORIES seeming to spread over it outlining it
Then suddenly group of strange lifeless figures began to drift from the closed door naked natives padding automatically outward toward the cir cle occupied by Lumsden and Al Jubal They moved toward the circle white and ghostly stretching out their arms toward the two who sat there yet unable to break into the circle
They passed around it billowing forward and back like wave silent sea of ghastly horror
feeling of terror crept into me dared not think what might happen should these fig ures from the tomb turn toward Mar garets tent
MY attention was attracted to the tomb for from it emerged single figure white and still Lord Warrender
His diaphanous shape was clear and distinct
His rugged face was drawn tight emotionless
He came for ward slowly toward the circle
glanced hastily toward the Sheikh and Lumsden
They were leaning excited ly forward and Lumsden had moved to the very edge of the circle oblivi ous to the hands stretched out toward him held back only by that invisible wall created in some manner by the strange magic known to the Sheikh
The shadowy Lord Warrender ap proached the circle and as he arrived at its outer edge the Sheikh rose up and thundered forth sentence that scattered the native spirits reaching toward the two in the circle
At that moment Lumsden broke the circle and Lord Warrenders vague form drifted through
At once Lumsden closed the circle again
Then strange thing happened
The ghostly shadow of Lord Warrender began to collapse sinking into the ground
Only when it had completely disap peared did the Sheikh turn his atten tion again to the guardian spirits of the tomb of Ai
He began now to drive them back into the tomb
They fought silently to reach beyond the circle then gradually their ghastly intent weakened they turned reluctantly and shuffled in weird procession back to the tomb through the door of which they returned as they had come
The glow began to fade away from the tomb and in few moments the Sheikh and Lumsden left the circle and came wearily over to me
went forward to meet them
He will run no more Harris said Lumsden
Then he looked gently at the tent which hid Margaret from us shook his head little and said Take care of her and get her away at once in the morning
dont want her here if anything should happen
It is not always easy to break curse and sometimes there is penalty
disregarded his enigmatic words then
But month later letter came from Lumsden
It was letter of fare well
He wrote at some length ram bling on for pages but the point of his letter lay in his last pathetic para graph AlJubal was found today near the tomb
He went from the hotel in the night like the others drawn by power we are unable to combat
Soon must go too
have been given short period of grace feel but the end is in sight
told you that it is not easy for mere man to break an ancient curse as we did that night on the desert and foresaw what might happen
That is why did not let you come into the circle with us so that the vengeance of Ai might not pursue you as it has pursued Al Jubal and as it must pursue me soon
We must pay with our lives for breaking the curse of Ai
The letter sent in answer was re turned marked Cannot be found
Inquiries set on foot brought for ward little
Ernest Lumsden had been seen walking from his hotel one night shortly after twelve
That was the last seen of him
Yet know what hap pened
have spared Margaret now my wife this knowledge and hope that no hint of the fate of Lumsden and the Sheikh AlJubal ever reaches her
do not think it will
IN THE NEXT ISSUE THE DOUBLE RING Story of an Egyptian Curse by Will Garth Man Routs Hell His Lesson Learned In Salem Town Where Witches Burned The little baroque was clinging to his chest its tiny hands buried wristdeep in his Sesh The Creeper in Darkness By FRANK BELKNAP LONG JR
Author oi Mind Out of Time The Black Vorter
Familiar of The tiny demoniac attendant witch or warlock
Crabbs English Dictionary
IT WAS very old house indeed
Dale Eliot notebook in hand ice blue eyes intently absorbed moved almost reverently over the duststrewn floor stopping here and there to examine articles of furniture which dated back to the late seven teenth century
Some pieces even an tedated this
Dale Eliot was professional anti quarian
He lived and breathed and had his being in the past
His emotions were so completely out of harmony with the modern world that he fright ened people
All men have roots deep STRANGE STORIES the past and when Dale Eliot talked he brought the past to life
There was something ghostly about him
He seemed to have stepped from the past into the present frozen swimmer emerging from the River of Time near its dim beginnings with the hoary foam of centuries clinging to his garments
But in this old witch house Dale Eliot was in his element
The witch house had been converted into museum for the edification of summer tourists
It was the third old est house in Salem and it stood on high windswept bluff overlooking Salem harbor
It did not attract tourists as the House of Seven Gables did
It was drab squat little house with gambrel roof that did not jut out as gambrel roofs should
Bleakly it faced the har bor presenting to the town merely windowless expanse of weathereroded wood which impressed antiquarians but left normal people cold
Dale Eliot was in all respects the exact opposite of normal person
He moved about in kind of trance ex amining objects which were unique in the annals of Salem
spinning wheel which had once belonged to notori ous witch dogeared prayer book annotated in the curious cramped cal ligraphy of the Reverend Increase Mather dour son of grim and re lentless father dour father of son who had left red thumb prints on the darkest pages of New England his tory
All of the treasured antiques were roped off but Eliot was contemptuous of the Do not touch signs scattered about the room
When he saw an ob ject which attracted him he approached it crept under the ropes and examined it with his hands
He liked the feel of old things
Now he was examining cabinet of drawers which stood under small paned window on the north side of the room
Examining it all over run ning his hands over it in critical ap praisal and even pulling the drawers in and out as he crouched in the gloom
Too bad too bad he murmured
The panels are badly warped
He was tugging at the lowermost drawer and balancing himself pre cariously on his instep when the little figure emerged
It emerged so unobtrusively that he did not notice it until it was standing almost directly beneath his hand blinking up at him in the dim yellow light which suffused the ancient room weirdly
The figure was scarcely three inches in height tiny shriveled human baroque with pointed ears and thin hairy tail
Peaked and duncolored it stood very still on the top of the cab inet and stared malignly up at him its tiny face repulsively puckered its shoulders hunched and misshapen
Eliots flesh congealed
Instinctively he retreated pace his pupils dilating his breath hissing from between his teeth
Do not be alarmed Dale Eliot shrilled the little horror
am your familiar
have waited here for you throughout the years
gasped Eliot his face corpse white
Your family familiar
Your greatgreatgrandfather was member of covin in good standing
at tached myself to all of your ancestors
You were born in this house
Dont you remember Dale Eliot
Eliot passed trembling hand across his brow
knew that was born in Salem he said
But did not remem ber the house
My mother died when was child
was brought up by relatives in Boston
The little figure nodded grimly
Well Dale we are together again
remember you as an infant rosy cheeked smiling but with the mark of his Satanic Majesty already upon you
You mean my ancestors were witches
Eliot asked in small voice
THE figure nodded
Yes Dale
Witches and warlocks
Your entire family attached themselves to his Satanic Majesty far back in the seventeenth century
Before Eliot could protest or cry out the little figure leaped upon him
Tiny clawlike hands fastened on his clothes and clung
With cry Eliot THE CREEPER IN DARKNESS staggered back across the room his fingers clutching at his chest The little horror was burrowing un der his shirt when the guard rushed angrily into the room
The guard was big heavyset man of Portuguese extraction dressed in summer linens
Look here sir he exclaimed
You cant yell like that in here
This is private house which is only open for antickarians
Eliot did not reply
He was backed up against the wall his fingers claw ing at his chest
The little figure was burrowing into his flesh
He could feel it squirming about under his clothes
The guard said Drunk eh
fine thing
And you grown man
He jerked thumb toward the door way of the room
Out he said
If you dont get out under your own steam Ill help you out
Eliot got out
He staggered blindly out of the room and down winding flight of stairs to the street
The sun light was clear and bright over Salem when he emerged on the high wind swept hill overlooking the harbor
But when he reached his lodgings halfmile away the sun westering was spilling down like blood splashingly ensanguining the gambrel roofs and red brick chimney pots of the old houses and turning the waters of Salem harbor deep rosy pink
Eliots room was on the top floor of threestory frame house on winding waterfront street where hollyhocks bloomed
He was trembling uncon trollably when he crossed wellkept lawn and ascended porch which creaked beneath his tread
HIS blue eyes mixture of stupe faction and terror he fumbled for his keys let himself into the house and mounted three flights of stairs to his attic room
He locked the door of the room before he crossed to the window and sat down on narrow cotlike bed
He sat down on the edge of the bed and removed his coat
He was wearing soft linen shirt and black bow tie
He ripped off the tie unbuttoned the shirt and removed it ripped off his undershirt The little baroque was clinging to his chest Its tiny hands were buried wristdeep in his flesh
All about it there was glistening crimson circle halo of bright blood
For an instant he stared down in silence at the tiny shriveled form
So great were his hor ror and revulsion that for an instant the room swayed about him
For an instant he thought he was going to faint The tiny shape was staring mali ciously up at him in the red sunlight which poured in through the open window crimsoning the sheets of the bed
From its narrow sloping skull two tiny black horns sprouted
In the dim light of the old house Eliot had failed to notice the horns
Utter horror engulfed him as he stared
The little baroque said It will take three days
When have firmly at tached myself will never leave you
Eliot spoke to it then
He scarcely recognized his own voice
It seemed like whisper from the grave
You mean your hands will grow into my flesh
Yes Dale
The wounds will heal and your flesh will become covin flesh and will obey the commands of his Satanic Majesty
See have made grooves for my hands
Eventually the wounds will heal
The little horror leaped suddenly from his chest to the sunreddened windowsill and stood perilously poised in the crimson glow mocking him
The two deep grooves where its hands had rested were welling redly
The little baroque said Night is falling
must sleep
Eliot went perfectly white when the little horror leaped back upon him in serted its hands into the encrimsoned grooves and coiled up in an attitude of repose
Sleep Dale it murmured as its eyelids flickered shut
You will not resent me so much tomorrow
And in the months and years to come you will not resent me at all
How Eliot passed the night he never knew
His thoughts were feverish de lirious
He twisted and turned dark ferment in his brain
Twisted and STRANGE STORIES turned until the dawn broke in the east outside the window of his room
When he awoke sunlight was flood ing the attic room
confused and merciful forgetfulness pervaded his faculties
Slowly his drowsy eyes took in the familiar contours of the room the sloping rafters of the ceiling that came to triangular focus high above his head the oaken chest where his clothes lay dresser with photo graph of his mother and brush comb and handmirror familiarly arranged upon it
Then he glanced down at the sheet which covered him and the horror came rushing back filling him with unutterable terror and loathing
Across the white sheet there stretched long trail of tiny bloody footprints
With despairing cry he threw the sheets off and glanced down at his naked torso
The little shape was stir ring restlessly in his flesh
Suddenly it opened its eyes and stared up at him
Good morning Dale it said
He made no attempt to dislodge it
He could not bring himself to touch it
Shaking in every limb he arose from the bed and put on his clothes
He dressed swiftly while the little hor ror mocked him
THE wounds in Eliots flesh were of deep violaceous hue
The blood had darkened coagulated
Slowly the little malign baroque with drew its hands and leaped to the win dowsill
It watched mockingly while Eliot struggled into his shirt and drew on his coat
The big clock in the hall outside was ticking slowly when Eliot de scended the stairs to the street
The little horror was squirming in his flesh again twisting about restlessly under his shirt
Eliot usually glanced at the morn ing paper before he let himself out
But now he simply pulled the paper from beneath the door and stuffed it in his coat pocket going down the steps of the porch and crossing the lawn with the swaying gait of drunken man
His one thought was to escape from the horror by seeking the companion ship of normal people
To escape for an instant from his terror by mingling with normal men and women
Perhaps it was all mad illusion
Perhaps he was entirely mad
He must find out
When he arrived at the little restaurant where he usu ally had breakfast he had reached momentous decision
He would enter the restaurant sit down and tear the horror from his flesh
He would expose it to the gaze of the people about him
He had to share the horror
It was driving him mad
At the little restau rant where he usually had breakfast he would meet people he knew
Kind ly sympathetic people
He must find out
The restaurant was less crowded than usual
Unsteadily he crossed to table in far corner picked up menu and glanced furtively about him
None of his acquaintances was hav ing breakfast at the restaurant this morning
The people who were sit ting there were complete strangers to him
Nevertheless he was determined to bring the horror into view
He could imagine what they would say
God what ghastly thing
What can it be
Its like little man
He could see the patrons of the res taurant rising in sudden terror upset ting their coffeecups sending plates crashing to the floor
But he had to have human sympathy and under standing
He had to know
He was fumbling with the buttons of his shirt when he heard the man at the adjoining table say No they cant explain it
He was found in his shop with his head bitten off
Chewed off
The medical exam iner said it looked like rat had chewed through the flesh of his throat
There were two men at the adjoin ing table
Now the second man was speaking
And they found little red footprints all over the shop
Human footprints tenth of an inch in length
Now thats puzzler for you
Ghastly said the first man
He raised cup of coffee to his lips
Eliot THE CREEPER IN DARKNESS saw his Adams apple rise and fall rise and fall
He was drinking all the scalding coffee at single draught as though the scalding horror in his mind was so unbearable that he had to scald his throat to keep from thinking of it
Suppose we talk about something else said the second man
Yeah lets
Its all in the papers anyway
We can read about it later on
With trembling fingers Eliot ripped the Salem Morning Chronicle from his pocket and spread it out on the table before him
The headlines fairly screamed at him Antiquarian found murdered
And in smaller type beneath Joseph Taylor prominent antiquarian of this city was found gruesomely murdered this morning in his antique shop at Elm Street
Mr Taylor who has liv ing quarters at the rear of the shop was found at am by Eliot rose from the table
Choking his face livid he staggered out of the restaurant into the blinding sunlight
The sunlight smote his eyes dazzling and halfblinding him
Indifferent to the glare clutching at his throat he reeled drunkenly down the street
Disturbed by his reeling gait the little baroque crept from beneath his shirt and stared coldly up at him
Well what is the matter now
What is the matter with you Dale Eliot
You killed him Eliot choked
Jo seph Taylor my friend
Yesterday afternoon when left his shop he was alive and well
The little baroque shrilled Yes know
You were furiously angry with him when you left the shop
He tried to cheat you
He attempted to sell you spurious antique
You swore to get even with him Dale
But didnt really mean it Eliot choked
didnt know Dale listen to me
killed him be cause you hated him
am your faith ful familiar
familiar is pledged to execute its masters wishes
All wiz ards magicians and warlocks have evil wishes
Eliot screamed You murderous little devil
His fingers went out and raked across his chest
Agilely the lit tle horror leaped aside and climbed to Eliots shoulder where it leered up into his face in malign derision
Of course am devil
demon little devil
Eliot groaned
will crush you to death
will strangle you with my hands
The little shape shrilled You can not destroy me Dale
would slip from your grasp
am elastic inde structible
Then will destroy myself
No Dale
will grow into your flesh and you will cease to hate me
child ran so swiftly past him that Eliot did not at first realize that he was not alone with the horror on the sundappled pavement
He did not know that little girl on her way to school had been watching him with wide wondering eyes and had now run swiftly by
The child had seen the little figure perched on his shoulder and was run ning screaming away from him her school books clutched tightly in her arms her pigtails flying
Suddenly she dashed out into the street
ELIOT was so immersed in horror that he saw the child merely as white blur moving swiftly through the sunlight
The street climbed steeply to bluff overlooking the bay
The child was running up the street but the automo bile was coming down
It was coming down with screeching of brakes and although the man in the car was try ing desperately to avoid running down the child he had seen her too late to swerve aside
The screeching brakes jarred Eliot from his daze
His vision cleared
He saw the child clearly saw the careen ing car
The car was less than twenty feet from the running child when he leaped with cry from the pavement He leaped toward the child and gave her violent push sending her sprawl ing across the street to safety
The car was traveling at thirty miles when it struck him
It smashed into STRANGE STORIES him and hurled him thirty feet through the air
With grinding scream it jolted to halt turning completely about on the steep gradient
Eliot thudded to the pavement and lay still blood trickling from his face
Sobbing with terror the child picked herself up and stared at the little form that was running from Eliots sprawl ing body across the pavement
Three feet from the curb the fleeing baroque staggered swayed
Its tiny hands went to his throat
It screamed in shrill agony
It whirled about like top
Then it tottered sideways and collapsed in heap in the dust of the gutter
HENhe who had nearly run down the child emerged whitelipped and trembling from the car the little shape was as unmoving as Eliots big bulk spread out on the pavement
Eliot awoke in world of whiteness
He was lying on soft mattress be tween white sheets and the walls of the room were white and so was the ceiling above him
When he moved whitehot shafts of searing pain shot through him
The girl who was bending above him and
smiling down at him was dressed entirely in white
She laid soft white hand on his forehead
You must rest now she said
You must get some sleep
Youve been unconscious for hours
Who who are you
gasped Eliot
And where where You are in the Salem General Hos pital said the girl
am your night nurse
But what happened
You were struck by an automobile this morning
You saved the life of little girl
Eliot remembered then
He started so violently that the nurse was com pelled to admonish him
You must try not to think about that
Later if you wish but not now
You must get some sleep
Eliot groaned
Sleep sleep
How can rest when that little monster The girl said You mean your good luck piece
Weve all been admiring it
You havent lost it
It is quite safe
They found it in the dust of the road way few feet from vhere you were lying
Eliot stared at her whitelipped
What do you mean
What did you find
The girl smiled and left him
Vhen she returned she was holding small flat object that glittered in the palm of her hand
Here it is she said
Would you like it near you
Tremulously Eliot took the little baroque
It was cold and metallic and very flat now tiny rigid figurine of bronze
The nurse said What an ugly lit tle horror
Wherever did you get it
have seen some unusual good luck charms my uncle collects them but this little bronze is unique
Ive never seen duplicate
She smiled
It is little too large to wear on watch chain
You just carry it loose in your pocket sup pose
It certainly brought you luck this morning
Eliot remembered then
Remem bered passage from an old book which he had read somewhere in the course of his antiquarian browsings and witchcraft studies
Even warlocks may be saved
Even witches and black sorcerers
By hero ism and sacrifice and repentance may warlocks be saved
And each demon that cannot abide goodness will shrivel and become as bronze forsaking its warlock when its warlock forsakes the Evil One dying in agony shriveling and dying
Eliots eyes were shining strangely when he took the nurses hand and de posited the little metallic figure on her palm
You say your uncle collects charms
The girl nodded
Then give this to him with my blessings
The nurse gasped
You you dont want it
Eliot smiled wanly
never want to see it again he said
have lived too long among antiques
shall live henceforth among people talk with them laugh with them work with them yes people are better than an tiques
people are best

Its as near in under the doorway that made to life itself as the movies sharp division between the glare of JL will ever come
Ive done it
California sunlight outside and the Blair OByrnes haunted black eyes lofty shadows of OByrnes long dim were bright with triumph
Abe Silvers gaunt and dark and hope youre right he said wearyeyed shifted the cigar to the around the cigar
Ive waited long other side of his mouth and stepped time for it
And God knows youve STRANGE STORIES spent more years than you ought and more money than even you could afford
Why have you done it Blair
man with your money your back ground shutting yourself up here in the dark sweating over shadows
havent been shut up away from life Ive been shut in with it
OByrnes smile spread across the pallor of his delicate face
Its life itself Ive been groping after all these years and Ive found it Abe
Ive got it
Got the illusion of it maybe
little better than MetroCosmic has been filming for the last few years
And if its as good as you say well buy it and so what
OByrne turned to him fiercely his dreamhaunted eyes suddenly blazing
tell you this is life
As near as shadows can come too near per haps
Moving pictures
Theyll have to find new name for what Ive got
It isnt pictures its breath ing living reality
Ive worked over it until nothing else seemed to mat ter nothing else seemed real
Ive got it Abe
Its life
ABE SILVERS shifted the cigar back across his mouth and if his eyes were understanding his voice was only patient
He had heard such words before from many fiercely sin cere inventors
That he had known OByrne for many years did not alter his accustomed attitude toward such things
All right he murmured
Show me
Wheres the projection room Blair
OByrne waved thin un steady hand toward the center of the big studio where under battery of highhung lights Ushaped bar of dull silver rose from low platform to the height of mans waist
Be yond it against the wall bulked big rectangular arrangement of chromium and glass behind whose face bulbs were dimly visible
Silvers snorted
That thing looks like radio that doubledover pipe
But the screen man the seats the Im telling you this is utterly new Abe
Youll have to clear your mind of all your preconceived ideas of what moving picture should be
All that is obsolete from this minute on
The moving picture is as dead as the magic lantern
This is the new thing
These batteries of lights that radio as you call it the platform and bar one for each individual spec tator But what is it
What happens
cant explain it to you now said OByrne impatiently
For one thing you wouldnt believe me until after youve seen it
And it would take weeks to give you enough groundwork to understand the prin ciples
The things too complex for anyone to explain in words
cant even explain the appearance except in metaphors theres never been any thing like it before
Roughly though its the projec tion of the illusion of life on three dimensional screen composed of fogged light
Other men are just beginning to fumble around with the principles of threedimensional mov ies projected on flat screen giving the appearance of stage with depth
Thats going at it clumsily
Ive ap proached the problem from much newer angle
My screen itself is threedimensional the light that bathes you when the batteries of arcs are on
Youre in the midst of it the action is projected on the light all around you from double films taken from slightly different angles on the stereoscopic principle
Ill show you later
And there is in that bar youre to hold on to sufficient current to stim ulate very selectively the nerves which carry tactile impression to the brain
Youll feel as well as hear and see
Youll even smell
On occasion you may actually taste its close enough to the sensations of smelling to work out
Only that doesnt figure so much in this case for you as spectator will not enter into the ac tion
Youll simply witness it from closer quarters than any audience has ever dreamed of doing before
Here step up on the platform and take hold of the rod there at the curve
Thats it
Now hold tight and dont be surprised
Remember MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS nothing like this has ever been done before
Abruptly the great banks of lights blazed into radiance that closed the dazzled Silvers about in soft pour ing brightness
There was quality of mistiness about it that made even his own hands invisible before him on the bar
It was as if the light poured upon innumerable motes in the air so refracting from their in finitesimal surfaces that nothing was visible but that shimmer of bright blindness
Silvers gripped the bar and waited
Through the bright fog voice as smooth as cream spoke in vast clear echoes rolling in from all around him at once filling the little artificial world of mist wherein he stood lost
Mellowly the deep tones said You are about to enter an en chanted wood outside Athens on midsummer night to share in dream that Shakespeare dreamed over three hundred years ago
Titania Queen of Faeryland will be played by Anne Acton
Oberon the King is Philip Graves Abe Silvers clutched the bar in amazement as that unctuous voice rolled on
Anne Acton and Philip Graves were under contract to his own MetroCosmic and every one of the other names were stars of the first magnitude
The greatest actors of the day were playing in this in credible fragment of Midsummer Nights Dream
What it had cost OByrne he shuddered to think
The creamy voice died away
The mist began to clear
Silvers hands closed hard on the bar and he stared in blankest incredulity about the dim blue glades of forest stretching around him silvery in the light of highriding moon
breeze whis pered through the leaves blowing cool on his face
Save that it did not stir hair of his head he could have believed it an actual breeze sighing through the moonlit dark
He looked down
He was himself invisible disembodied no longer standing on bare floor but in the midst of flowering meadow whose grasses were faintly fragrant at his feet
There was no flicker no visible lightandshadow composition of the projection upon this incredible three dimensional screen that surrounded him
The glade stretched away into actual distances much deeper than the studios walls could possibly con tain the illusion of deep starry sky overhead was perfect the flowers in the grass were so real he thought he could have knelt and gathered them in his hands
Then under the trees the mists parted like curtain and the Queen of Faeryland came splendidly into the moonlit glade
Anne Acton had never looked so lovely
The long veil of her silverpale hair streamed like gossamer behind her and every curve and shadowy roundness was as real as life itself
Yet there hovered about her hint of unreality so that she blended perfectly the illusion of fan tasy and reality as she moved over the unbending grass the bright wings streaming from her shoulders
THERE was blast of silvery chal lenge from elfin horns and into the moonlight strode Oberon his lean features wrathful
The famous deep tones of Philip Graves resounded an grily through the moonlight
Titania answered in silvery defiance
Then came full rich human voices ringing through the wood
Phoebe Templeton in Hermias rustling satin came radiantly into the glade brush ing so close by the watching Silvers that he caught whiff of her per fume felt the touch of her satin skirts
And he knew almost he knew that he could put out hand and stop her so warmly real was she at that close range
Her lovely throaty voice called to Lysander behind her
And then somehow the forest was slipping away past Abe Silvers face somehow he had the illusion of walking as if in dream down an en chanted forest aisle the dim air quivering with starlight and Helena came running and weeping through the trees stumbling sobbing the name of Demetrius
She passed
Silvers started invol untarily as from swaying branch STRANGE STORIES above him pealed the wild half human laughter of Puck delicate as the chatter of squirrel and down through the air over his very shoul der the breeze of his passing fanning Silvers face the lithe little goblin sprang
The scene clouded over as if mist had been drawn across the moon
Silvers blinked involuntarily and when he looked again Titania lay ex quisitely asleep on the dewspangled bank where the wild thyme grew
Then through the magichaunted wood suddenly shrilled bell
In sistently metallically it rang
Sil vers glanced about the glades of the forest trying to locate among the dewshimmering leaves the source of that irritating noise
And suddenly the Athenian woods melted like smoke about him
Incredulously he stared around big bare studio
It was like waking in bewilderment from dream so vivid that reality itself paled beside its memory
The studio wants you on the tele phone Abe said OByrnes voice
Here wake up
Didnt you hear the bell
SILVERS shook himself laughed sheepishly
Im still in Athens he admitted blinking
Thats the damnedest thing ever studio did you say
Wheres the phone
Thinly over the wire came wor ried voice
Hate to bother you chief but think you ought to know
Anne Ac tons been mumbling around in sort of daze for half an hour
The doctor cant do thing with her
And Philip Graves passed out on set and is just kind of whispering to himself poetry it sounds like
Silvers blinked
Ddont let the papers get it
Ill be right over
He slammed the telephone back on its cradle and turned blankly to OByrne
Somethings gone wrong with couple of our actors you stole he said
Ive got to get back right away
But listen Blair youve got something How long will it take you to have some more of these bar and platform arrangements rigged up
Say dozen for starter
Id like to have our board see it as soon as possible
This is going to be the most tremendous thing that ever hap pened in motion pictures
When can you have things ready to show the board
dont know Abe
Somehow Im little afraid of it
Good God man what do you mean
dont know exactly but did you have feeling as you watched the action that somehow it came too near to life
Blair Im afraid youve been working too hard on this
Let me handle it from now on will you
And stop thinking about it
Ive got to get back to the studio now and see whats happened to my actors attack of temperament probably but Ill see you tonight about quantity production
Until then you wont let anyone else in on this will you
You know wont Abe
Its yours if you want it
All the way back to the studio Silvers mind was spinning with the magnitude of what lay before him
He had dared to let the inventor know how enormously impressed he was how anxious to have the new process because he knew OByrne so well
The man was wealthy in his own right indifferent to fame to everything but the deep need to cre ate which had driven him so hard for so many years toward the completion of his miracle
Miracle in three di mension
It seemed like dream what he had just seen but behind it lay the prospect for fortune vaster than any movie magnate had ever dared to hope for
To control this was to control the whole world
Sil vers clenched his cigar tighter and dreamed magnificent dreams
Anne Acton lay on low couch in her lavish little dressing bungalow staring up with conscious pathos into the doctors face as Silvers came into the room
Somehow illogically it was shock to him to see her here when he had so short time before MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS left that perfect illusion of herself in the enchanted wood outside Ath ens asleep on the bank of wild thyme
How are you Anne
he de manded anxiously for she repre sented fabulous sum to the com pany and an illness now in the midst of her latest picture would be ruin ous
Is she all right Doc
When did she come out of it
While they were phoning you Abe said Acton herself in faint pathetic voice moving her head un easily so that the great slipping rope of silverpale hair moved across the brocade
It it was all so queer
Suddenly felt too tired to move as if all the strength had drained right out of me
And must have fainted but wasnt really out
Kept having sort of dreams dont remember now woods somewhere and music
And suddenly it all ended and opened my eyes here
Im all right now only feel as weak as kitten
She held up an exquisite hand to show it quivering
What is it Doc
demanded Sil vers anxiously
Ummra overwork perhaps gen eral exhaustion its impossible to say definitely without further exam ination
Will she be okay now
see no reason why with rest and care she shouldnt be
Ill send for your car Anne said Silvers authoritatively
Youre going home to bed
Ill see you later
Philip Graves in the braidbe decked finery of movie caballero was sitting up on his couch and holding cigarette in unsteady fin gers when Silvers pushed through the little knot of attendants that sur rounded him
Feeling better Phil
he de manded
What was it
Nothing nothing said the actor impatiently
Im okay now
Just passed out for few minutes
Ill be all right
Abe Silvers lost no time in calling meeting of the board
The twelve members of MetroCosmic stood about in twos and threes murmuring incredulously in the shadows of the OByrne studio on the night when the first dozen barplatforms were erected
Silvers had not dared to describe fully this modern miracle
Its like nothing you ever saw be fore he warned them as rather sheepishly they allowed themselves to be herded forward to the plat forms
When they were all at their stations and Silvers signaled OByrne to begin he glanced once around the little company before the lights blazed on Doubtfully they returned his stare with murmur or two of protest rising
Feel so damn silly an official said standing here
Mean to say there isnt any screen
What are we sup posed to look at
AND then like wall of brilliant blindness the foggy light closed down upon them and every man was cut off from his fellows so that he stood alone and disembodied in the heart of that soft misty blaze
Star tled exclamations sounded through the mist murmurs that died away as Silvers heard for the second time the creamy smoothness of the announcers voice rolling through the dimming brightness
You are now about to enter an en chanted wood outside Athens on midsummer night to share in dream that Shakespeare dreamed Somehow as the play went on Abe Silvers began to wonder little un easily at the violence of the quarrel between Titania and Oberon that flamed almost tangibly through the clear dim air
Had they fought be fore so fiercely
Had they gibber of wild inhuman laughter the long leap of Puck over his shoul der broke the queer thought half formed just as bell began to shrill through the forest
He knew mo ment of unreality
He remembered that in the previous performance the bell had not rung until Titania lay down to sleep on the bank where the wild thyme grew
But with shocking completeness the forest vanished
Sil vers stared blankly around the stu dios reaches that had so suddenly STRANGE STORIES replaced the glades of faeryland blinking at the circle of dazed men in amazement
Telephone for you Abe OByrnes voice called through the fading mists of the dream that had so strongly gripped him
He grinned sheepishly and stepped down from the platform
Listen chief babbled distressed voice over the wire shrill above the rising babble of delight behind Sil vers Actons out like light at the Grove Is she plastered
dont think so but try to tell the papers that
She wait oh shes just coming out of it
Whatll we do
Send her home sighed Silvers
Ill get onto the papers right away
Vhat life
HE turned back to OByrne with shrug
Actons passed out again he murmured unhappily
wonder if she well if she folds now in the middle of Never Tomorrow well lose our shirts on it
Im going to get doctor to Abe said OByrne in voice so quiet that the other man turned to him in surprise Abe do you realize that every time we run this picture Anne Acton faints
wonder if the other actors feel the same reaction
Why what do you mean
Why should they
Blair are you going crazy
Silvers voice was stoutly confident but despite himself an uneasy little flicker woke in his mind
Philip Graves who played Oberon had been dazed and out of his head too that other time
And yes hadnt he no ticed an item in gossip column say ing that Phoebe Templeton had col lapsed at tea in New York
Was it the same day
Rather terrifyingly he thought it was
But of course all this was the most flagrant nonsense
His job now was to keep Acton out of the papers
She had not endeared herself to reporters and he knew they would make the story sound as bad as possible
They the phone rejig again
wire from Philip Graves man has just come in Abe his wifes voice told him worriedly
Philips been taken terribly sick on shipboard
His man says it will be in all the papers tomorrow and he wants your advice
Silvers ran hand distractedly through his hair
Thanks he said little blankly
Ill take care of it
Be home later
He turned to the men still grouped around the barplatforms in their babble of amazed delight
They had not heard his lowvoiced conversa tions at the desk
Weve got this fellow under con tract havent we
said someone anx iously at his elbow
Ought to get go ing on production right away
This is the most tremendous thing that ever happened
Yes hell let us have it Silvers told him abstractedly
Blair hows the production on the first hundred barplatforms coming
Weve got to give larger showing right away
hundred and fifty will be ready in about week OByrne admitted reluctantly
But Abe Abe do you think we ought to do it
Silvers pulled him aside
Look Blair he said gently you mustnt let your imagination run away with you
What possible connection can there be between the showing of this picture and the fact that few over worked nervous people have fainting spells
Ill admit its coincidence but weve got to be sensible
We cant let the biggest thing that ever happened in pictures slip through our fingers just because some dizzy actress passes out once or twice
OByrne shrugged little
won der he murmured as if thinking aloud how long people have been trying to create life
Somethings always prevented it no ones been allowed to succeed
This thing of mine isnt life but its too near it to leave me at peace with myself
think theres penalty for usurping the powers of godhead for coming too close to success
Im afraid Abe
Blair will you do me favor
demanded Silvers
Will you go to MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS bed and forget all about this until morning
Ill see you tomorrow
Right now Im up to my neck in trouble
OByrne smiled ghostily
All right he said
TEMPLETONFREDERICKS ELOPEMENT
That was the headline the news boys were yelling when Silvers stepped out of his car the next day
He looked twice at the headline to be sure for the romance of Phoebe Tem pleton not with Bill Fredericks but with Manfield Drake had kept screen magazines in ecstasies for the past six months
The wedding was to have been this week but he bought paper hastily wild thought flash ing through his mind
Templeton and Fredericks had played the lovers in OByrnes photoplay
Bill and have known one another for about six months Phoebe Tem pleton was quoted as saying but we never realized until last night how much we meant to each other
It happened rather miraculously
was on my way west and Bill was heTe in Hollywood
And suddenly in Den ver it came over me that simply must talk to him
phoned long dis tance and well its all pretty hazy to look back on but chartered plane and met him in Yuma and we were married this morning
Of course feel badly about Manfield but really this was too big to fight against
Weve known since ten oclock last night that we were meant for each other
Silvers tucked the paper under his arm and bit down hard on his cigar
It was at ten last night that they had watched Hermia and Lysander in the actual breathing presences of Templeton and Fredericks murmur ing passionate love under high floating moon
For moment fan tastic wonder crossed his mind
must be going nuts he murmured to himself
week later an audience of hun dred and fifty people gathered for the real preview of OByrnes Mid summer Nights Dream
The bar platforms had been set up in the big studio that had seen the first running of the miraculous illusion
It was crowded now with murmurous and skeptical people officers and direc tors of MetroCosmic sprinkling of wives
Silvers conquered an inex plicable uneasiness as he sought OByrne in corner near the con trols
Blair was sitting on heavy stool before the machine and the face he turned to his friend was full of queer strained tension
He said his voice thread of sound Abe Ive had the maddest notion that every time show this the fig ures come back realer than before into the scenes they play
Maybe they dont always hold to the action we photographed maybe the plot carries them on beyond what Shake speare wrote more violently than SILVERS fingers gripped the other mans shoulders hard
Sharply he shook him an absurd uneasiness darkening his memory of that im pression of fiercer violence in the quarrel between Oberon and Titania the last time he saw the play even as he said firmly Snap out of it Blair
Youve been working too hard
Maybe someone else could run the picture tonight you need rest
OByrne looked up at him apathet ically his alarm gone suddenly flat
No Ill do it
If youre really de termined to run the thing maybe Id better
Maybe can control them better than an assistant could
After all created them
Silvers looked down at him for moment in frowning silence
Then he shrugged and turned toward the last empty barplatform where the audience waited the beginning of the show
OByrne was dangerously over worked he told himself
After this was over he must go to sanatorium for long rest
His mind was crack ing
Misty radiance closed down about him veiling the hundred and fifty from his vision
There was mo ment of murmurous wonder punctu ated by small halffrightened screams STRANGE STORIES from few of the women as each spectator was shut off into little world of silence and solitude
Into the silvery mist that familiar rich voice rolled smoothly
For the third time Silvers saw the broad gray glades of faeryland hedged with im memorial forest opening magically up about him
For the third time Ti tania trailed her streaming wings into the moonlight
Oberon strode with jingle of mail from among the trees and they met in fury halfway down the glade their feet pressing the bending grass with elfin light ness
But there was no lightness in their anger
That ancient quarrel flared up in violence between them and the breezes shivered with their wrath
Again Hermia and Lysander came half laughing half fearful into the woods
Again Helena sobbed Deme trius name among the unanswering trees
Puck flitted in goblin glee about his business of enchantment and Titania lay down to sleep on the spangled grass among the wild thyme
THIS time no telephone bell broke into the magic of the dream
And again these were living people who moved so tangibly before the audience the wind of their passing brushing them the sound of their breathing in their ears when they stood near going about their magic haunted ways as obliviously as if the spectators were the phantoms not they
Their loves and hates and heartbreak were vividly real under that incredibly real moon
Once or twice Silvers thought vaguely that here and there in the action things happened not exactly as he remembered them
Had Titania actually slapped Oberons dark angry face before she swept out of the glade
Had Hermia and Lysander kissed quite so lingeringly under that deepshadowed oak
But as the play went on Silvers lost all thought of times that had gone before and sank fathoms deep in the reality of the scene before him
Puck lured the spellbewildered lovers into the fastnesses of the for est
They went stumbling through the fog quarreling blinded by mist and magic and their own troubled hearts
Swords flashed in the moon light
Lysander and Demetrius were fighting among the veiled trees
Puck laughed shrill and high and inhu man and swept his brown arm down
And from Lysander came choked gasp the clatter of fallen sword
Demetrius bent fiercely above him
Silvers watched the bright blood bub bling from his side saw the blade drip darkly smelled the acrid sharp ness of that spreading stain
The il lusion was marvelous
Lysanders death was miracle of artistry from the first choked gasp of pain to the last bubbling of blood in his throat the last twist of handsome silk sheathed limbs
Lysanders death Something troubled Silvers mem ory but before he could capture it womans voice cried hysterically somewhere in the misty forest Hes dead hes dead
and suddenly blankly the forest was gone from about them and he was staring into dazed halfdreaming faces where an instant before faeryland had stretched depth upon depth of moonlit dimness where Lysander had lain dying on the moss
Somewhere in the crowd woman was sobbing hysterically
Hes dead tell you
Lysanders dead and he doesnt really die in the play
Someones killed him
That was real blood smelled it
Oh get me out of this awful place
Silvers brushed the fog of dream land from his eyes and was halfway across the floor to the projection machine before the scream had ended for he remembered now that tug of memory as Lysander fell
Shake speares play was romance not trag edy
Lysander should not have died
OByrne clung to his high stool his fingers whiteknuckled as he stared into Silvers eyes
You see
he said in strained monotone
You see what mass hyp notism will do
They couldnt help it poor things they must be half alive wandering in the fog
Silvers voice rang sharply
MIRACLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS Blair snap out of it
What are you raving about
Are you mad
The staring eyes turned to his al most apathetically
was afraid said OByrne in that whispering monotone as if he spoke in dream
was afraid to run it before this many people should have guessed what would hap pen when Acton and Graves and Are you still harping on that co incidence
demanded Silvers in fierce undertone
Cant you see how foolish it is Blair
What earthly African savages Tibetan nomads Chinese peasants South American Indians
Even the ancient Egyptians highly civilized as they were delib erately made their drawings angular and unlifelike
All of them declared and believed that too good likeness would draw the soul out into the picture
Well yes everybodys heard of such things but youre not suggest ing After the Templeton elopement after Anne Actons faintingpells THE PRISONER OF MARS Complete BookLength Novel of War Between Worlds By EDMOND HAMILTON and Many Other Unusual Stories and Features oming in the May Issue of Our Companion Scientifiction Magazine STARTLING STORIES AT ALL STANDS connection can there be between pic tures on screen and living people some of them half the world away
Ill admit what happened tonight was Did you ever hear broke in Blair softly as if he were following some private train of thought and had not heeded word of Silvers harangue of savages covering their faces when explorers bring out their cameras
They think photo graph will steal their souls
Its an idea so widespread that it cant have originated in mere local superstition
Tribes all over the world have it
and Philip Graves illness yes after what happened tonight how can you deny it Abe
No the Egyptians the modern savages were closer to the truth than we
Only before now no likeness has been perfect enough to absorb sufficient personality so that people could notice it
But these il lusions of mine theyre real living breathing
While you watch you cant believe the actual men and women arent standing in front of you
It had an effect on Acton and Graves when only you were watching enough of their personality was STRANGE STORIES drained out of them into the illusion by your own temporary conviction that they were there so that they went into vague dreams of woodland and music
dont know how the other actors were affected do know that several of them were sick and dizzy that day
havent checked maybe Ive been afraid to
When the twelve boardmembers were watching the drain was stronger so that Graves was really ill on shipboard and Acton couldnt be roused from her faint until the telephone call to you broke the illu sion here
It affected Templeton and Bill Fredericks another way hypno tized them into believing what the audience was believing that they were really in love ECOLLECTION flooded into Silvers mind
He remembered what he had felt when he read the headlines of the elopement
He said Could it happen that way Blair
How greatly could mass mind affect the reactions of the people it con centrates on
thought of it before if twelve individuals each con vinced for time that he saw two people desperately in love might really work sort of persuasion on those two No thats crazy
It couldnt happen
You saw it happen murmured Blair quietly
You saw what hap pened when hundred and fifty peo ple joined in that fierce concentra tion that utter conviction that they saw mans sword poised aimed de scending mass hypnotism it was
For majority of them that sword really struck their imagination out ran the actual fact and they thought they saw Lysander spitted on Deme trius blade
They thought they saw him die
Well he didnt did he
mean nothing happened this time or theyd have called me
thin smile twisted up OByrnes strained mouth
He reached behind him
Silvers heard click and real ised that the telephone had been ly ing out of its cradle on the desk ever since he reached Blairs side
wanted you to understand be fore they broke the news to you OByrne was explaining gently
And knew the telephone would inter rupt ime unless Shrill buzzing whirred from the desk
With little spurt of terror for what he had yet to learn Silvers snatched it up
voice shouted thinly in his ear Silvers
Is that you chief
My God Ive been trying to get you all evening
Actons been in coma for over an hour doctor cant rouse her
And call just came in from London that Phil Graves is out too cant be waked
And whats that
Words just come in that Templetons passed out too and Bill Fredericks has dropped dead
Whats the matter with this town
Its like the end of the world Abe OByrnes voice behind him twisted Silvers around like hand on his shoulder
The receiver shrilled unnoticed as their eyes met
OByrnes face was almost serene knowledge of what the telephone was crying showed in his eyes
He said Do you believe me now
Do you understand
Do you realize how much of life itself Ive woven into this damnable thing Ive made
Yes its like twodimensional pictures that carry shadow of the third enough dark to give feeling of depth
In my threedimensional pic ture Ive somehow got shadow of the fourth life maybe or some thing too near it
Maybe thats what the fourth dimension is life itself
But it wont kill men again not again
THE crash of glass shattered into the hysterical buzz of the crowd
Silence like death fell over the con fusion of the murmurous throng among the barplatforms as they turned white faces toward the corner
OByrnes frail arms swung his heavy stool with desperate strength crunch ing and smashing and crashing among the delicate intricacies of his pro jector
Silvers clutched the still shrilling telephone and watched him not moving
Question of Identity No Pang of Hunger nor Torment of Thirst Can Stifle the Questions of Who Where and What
By TARLETON FISKE Author of The Sorcerers Jewel etc
LIMBS were lead
My that moved like sluggish quicksil heart was great coiled ver back and forth in burning waves
clock that throbbed rather than ticked ever so slowly
My lungs were metal sponges my head bronze bowl filled with molted lava Back and forth consciousness and unconsciousness interplaying against background of slow dark pain
felt just that nothing more
was in coJBn in wooden coffin STRANGE STORIES had heart lungs body head but felt nothing external that is my body did not impinge on anything
was not sitting or standing or walking or lying or doing anything that could feel
was just heart lungs body head alone in darkness that was filled with the pulsing of muted agony
This was myself
But who was
The thought came the first real thought for before that had been only an awareness of being
Now wondered as to the nature of my being
Who was
was man
The word man aroused certain as sociations which struggled through the pain through the thumping heart and gasping lung sensation
If was man what was doing
Where was
AS IF in response to the thought awareness increased
had body and therefore possessed hands ears eyes
must try to feel hear see
But could not
My arms were lumps of immovable iron
My ears knew only the sound of silence and the throbbing that came from within my tortured body
My eyes were sealed by the leaden weight of enor mous eyelids
This knew and felt panic
What had happened
What was wrong with me
Why couldnt feel and hear and see
had been in an accident and was lying on hospital bed under ether
That was one explanation
Perhaps had been crippled blinded deafened maimed
Only my soul ex isted faintly like whispering that rustles through the ruins of an old old house
But what accident
Where had been before this
must have lived
What was my name
resigned myself to the darkness as strove to grapple with these problems and the darkness was kind
My body and the darkness seemed to be equally detached so that they min gled
It was peaceful too peaceful for the thoughts that throbbed through my brain
The thoughts fought and clamored and finally screamed until felt myself awaken
It was the sensation vaguely re called of finding ones foot asleep
It spread over my body so that pleasant tingling made me aware bit by bit of having definite arms and hands definite chest and pelvis defi nite legs and feet
Their outlines emerged and were defined by that tingling
burring droned in my spine as though den tists drill had bit into it
Simulta neously became aware that my heart was Congo drum within my chest my lungs great gourds swell ing and sinking in frantic rhythm
exulted in the pain for through it felt myself
That sensation of de tachment faded and knew that complete intact lay against soft ness
But where
That was the next question and sudden energy seemed ready to solve it
My eyes opened
They encoun tered nothing but continuation of the blackness which lurks behind the curtains of closed lids
If anything the blackness was deeper richer
could see nothing of myself and yet my eyes were open
Was blind
My ears still heard no sound other than the mysterious inspiration of my own breath
My hands moved ever so slowly at my sides rustling against cloth which told me that my limbs were clothed and yet unblanketed
They moved upward outward
An inch two inches three and then they en countered hard unyielding surfaces on either side
They rose upward prompted by fear
Six inches and another unyielding surface of wood
My feet thrust out as stretched and through shoeleather the tips of my toes encountered wood
My mouth opened and sound poured forth
It was only rattle though had meant to scream
For my thoughts whirled around one name one name that somehow groped through haze and loomed as the symbol of my unreasoning fear
knew name and wanted to scream
Edgar Allan Poe
And then my rattling voice whis QUESTION Of IDENTITY pered unprompted that which so feared in connection with this name
The Premature Burial whis pered
Poe wrote it
am living it
was in coffin in wooden cof fin with the hot stale air of my own corruption reeking in my nostrils burning in my lungs
was in coffin locked in earth and yet was alive
Then found strength
My hands had been frantically scratching and clawing at the surface above my head
Now they gripped the sides of my prison and thrust outward with all strength my legs braced at the foot of the box
My legs then kicked
New vigor the vigor of madman rushed through my boil ing blood
In sheer frenzy in an agony born of the fact that could not scream and give expression to it lashed out with both feet at the bottom of the coffin felt it splinter and give way
Then the sides cracked my bleed ing fingers clutched at the earth be yond and rolled over burrowing and scrabbling at the moist soft packed earth
dug upwards wheez ing in sort of mindless desperation as worked
Instinct alone combatted the insane horror which gripped my being and transformed it into the activity which alone could save me
They must have buried me in hurry
The earth above my grave was shallow
Choking and half suf focated clawed my way to the top after endless eons of utter delirium during which the dust of the grave covered me and wriggled like worm through the dark ground
My hands reached up to form cavity then lunged upward with full strength and burst through to the surface
crawled out into silvery moon light flooding down upon world of marble toadstools which sprouted richly from the mounds of grass all about me
Some of the fantastic stone growths were crossshaped others bore heads or great urnlike mouths
They were the headstones of graves naturally but saw only toadstools fat bloated toadstools of deadwhite pallor reaching unthink able roots into the ground below to draw forth nourishment
lay staring at them staring back at the pit through which had come up out of death into life once again
did not could not think
The words Edgar Allan Poe and Pre mature Burial had come unbidden to my brain and now for some rea son found myself whispering in hoarse dreadful voice then croon ing more loudly Lazarus
RADUALLY my panting sub sided and drew fresh strength from the air that sang through my lungs
stared at the grave again my grave
It bore no headstone
It was poor grave in poor section of the cemetery probably Potters Field
Nearly on the outskirts of the ne cropolis it was and weeds writhed over the poor graves
There was no headstones and it made me remem ber my question
Who was
It was unique prob lem
had been someone before died but who
Surely this was novel case of amnesia to return to new life in the actual sense of the phrase
Who was
Funny could think of words like amnesia and yet could not in the least associate them with anything personal in my past
My mind was utterly blank
Did death do this to me
Was it permanent or would my mind awaken in few hours just as my body had
If not was in sore straits
didnt know my name or my station what had been
For that matter on reflection didnt even know where was
The names of cities flooded foolishly through my brain
Chicago Milwaukee Los Angeles Washington Bombay Shanghai Cleveland Chichen Itza Pernambuco Angkor Wat Rome Omsk Carthage
could not associ ate single one with myself or for that matter explain how knew those names
thought of streets of Mariposa Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and STRANGE STORIES Broadway and Center Street and Park Lane and the Champs Elysees
They meant nothing to me
thought of proper names
Felix Kennaston Ben Blue Ralph Waldo Emerson Studs Lonigan Arthur Gordon Pym James Gordon Bennett Samuel Butler Igor Stravinsky and they represented no image of myself
could see all those streets visu alize all those people picture all those cities but myself could not associate with any of them
Comedy tragedy drama it was mad scene to play in cemetery at nightfall
had crawled out of grave without headstone and all know was that was man
And yet who
My eyes roved over my person ly ing in the grass
Beneath mud and dirt saw dark suit torn in places and discolored
It covered the body of tall man thin body poorly muscled and flatchested
My hands rustling over my person were long and leanly muscular they were not the hands of labourer
Of my face knew nothing though passed my hand over each feature in turn
One thing felt certain oft whatever the cause of my apparent death was not physically maimed
STRENGTH prompted me to rise
rose to my feet stumbled over the grass
For few minutes had that drunken floating sensation but gradually the ground became solid under my feet knew awareness of the cool night wind on my forehead heard with indescribable joy the chirping of crickets from swamp afar
walked around the tombstones gazed at the clouding sky felt dew and dampness fall
But my brain was aloof detached wrestling with invisible demons of doubt
Who was
What was to do
could not wander strange streets in my disheveled condition
If presented myself to authorities would be put away as madman
Besides did not want to see any one
This fact realized quite sud denly
did not wish to see lights or people
was different
It was the feeling of death
Was still
Unable to bear the thought fran tically groped for clues
tried every means of awakening dormant memories
Walking endlessly the night through combatting chaos and confusion fighting the gray clouds that clung to my brain wandered up and down the deserted corner of the cemetery
Exhausted stared at lightened sky
And then my thoughts fled away even the confused ones
knew only one thing the need for rest and peace and forgetfulness
Was it the deathurge
Had risen from the grave only to return
neither knew nor cared
Actu ated by compulsion as inexplicable as it was overpowering stumbled toward the ruins of my grave and crept inside burrowing like mole into the grateful darkness whilst the earth tumbled in behind me
There was enough air the thought came to enable me to breathe while lay back in the shattered coffin
My head fell back and settled in my coffin to sleep
The muttering and rumbling died away from dreams could not re member
They died away from dreams and grew in reality until sat up pushing wet earth so that it fell around me
was in the grave
Again terror
Somehow the hope had lurked that this was dream and awakening might bring me to grate ful reality
But was in the grave and storm howled above
crawled upward
It was still night or rather in stinct prompted me to believe that it was night again
must have slept the clock around
This storm had kept people from the graveyard kept them from discovering the torn earth and its inmate
rose to the surface and the rain lashed me from skies wild with anger
And yet was happy happy for the life knew
drank the rain the thunder enraptured me as though it were symphony marvelled at the lightnings emerald beauty
was alive
All about me corpses rotted and QUESTION OF IDENTITY sloughed nor could all the fury of the unleashed elements imbue them with one spark of existence or of memory
My own poor thoughts my own poor life were infinitely pre cious in comparison to the lot of those below
had cheated worm and maggot let the storm howl
would howl with it share in the cosmic jest
Vitalized in the truest sense of the word began to walk
The rain washed the earthstains from my gar ments and body
Singularly felt no cold no especial dampness
was aware of these things but they did not seem to penetrate
For the first time realized another odd thing was not hungry or thirsty
At least did not seem to be
Had appetite died with memory
won dered
Memory the problem of identity still pressed
walked along impelled by the storm
Still pondering my feet carried me past the confines of the cemetery
The gale leading me seemed to guide my footsteps out onto the stone sidewalk of deserted street
walked almost without heeding
Who was
How had died
How revived
walked through the rain down the dark street alone in the wet velvet of the night
Who was
How had died
How revived
crossed block entered nar rower street still stumbling alone with the wind and the laugh of thunder from clouds mocking my be wilderment
Who was knew
My name the street told me
Summit Street
Who lived on Summit Street
Arthur Derwin my self
was Arthur Derwin of Sum mit Street
used to be something couldnt remember
had lived lived for years and yet all could recall was my name
How had died
had been to the seance and the lights were out and Mrs Price was calling to someone
She had screamed something about evil influences and then the lights had gone on
They hadnt gone on
But they must have
They had but wasnt there
had died
Died in the darkness at the seance
What killed me
Shock perhaps
And then what hap pened
Mrs Price had hushed it up
was alone in the city had been buried hurriedly in paupers grave
Heart failure the coroner had probably called it
was laid away
That was it
And yet was Arthur Derwin and surely somebody had cared
Bramin Street said the sign in the lightning
Bramin Street someone had cared Viola
Viola had been my fiancee
She had loved Arthur Derwin
What was her last name
Where had met her
What did she look like
Bramin Street
Again the sign
Unconsciously my feet seemed to have led me down this way
was walking down Bramin Street without thinking in the storm
Very well
would let my feet lead the way
wouldnt think
My feet would take me to Violas home through habit
There would learn
No thinking now
Just walk through the storm
WALKED my eyes closed to the blackness through which thunder beat
walked out of death and was hungry now
was hungry and thirsty here in the night and was hungry to see Viola and thirsty for her lips
had come back from death for her or was that too poetic
came from the grave and went back to sleep in it and rose again and sought the world without memory
It was gruesome and grim and macabre
died at seance
My feet plodded slopping through rain
felt no cold no wet
was warm inside warm with the memory of Viola her lips her hair
She was blonde remembered
Her hair was coiled sunlight her eyes blue and deep as the sea her skin the milky white ness of unicorns flanks
had told her so recalled when had held her in my arms
knew her mouth as STRANGE STORIES scarlet gate to ecstasy
She was the hunger within me she the burning beacon of desire that led me back through mists of memory to her door
was panting and did not know it
Within me revolved wheel that had once been my brain and was now just grinding round screen flashing kaleidoscopic images of Viola of the grave of seance and evil presences and inexplicable death
Viola had been interested in mysticism had been interested in the occult We went to the seance
Mrs Price was famous medium
died at the seance and woke up in grave
came back to see Viola
came back to find out about myself
knew now what was how had died
But how revived
But bow revived
Bramin Street
Feet plodding
And then instinct turned my feet up the pathway to the porch
It was in stinct which caused my hand to fumble for the familiar doorknob without knocking instinct which led me across the threshold
STOOD in hallway deserted hallway
There was mirror there and for the first time could see my self
Perhaps that would shock me into complete remembrance and recogni tion
looked but the mirror faded before my gaze into blur
felt weak dazed
But it was due to the hunger within me the hunger which burned
It was late
Viola wouldnt be downstairs
She would be in her bed room at this hour
went up the stairs dripping water at every step walking quite silently aside from the little dripping patter of rills running down to the stair below
All at once giddiness left me again and felt strong
had the feeling that was ascending the stairs to Des tiny as though once reached the top would know the truth of my fate
Something had brought me from the grave here
Something lay behind this mysterious resurrection
The answer lay above
reached the top turned down the dark familiar hall
The bedroom door opened beneath my hand
candle burned at the bedside nothing more
And saw Viola lying there
She slept incarnate beauty slept
She was very young and lovely at that moment and felt pity for her at what she must know upon awakening
called softly
called softly and while did so my brain said the last of the three questions over and over
And how revived
said my brain
called my voice
She opened her eyes allowed life to flood them
She saw me
Arthur she gasped
Youre dead
It was scream that last
Yes said softly
Why did say Yes
And my brain whispered And how revived
She rose up shuddering
Youre dead ghost
We buried you
Mrs Price was afraid
You died at the seance
Go away Arthur youre dead
She moaned it over and over
looked at her beauty and knew hunger
thousand memories of that last eve ning came to me
The seance and Mrs Price warning of evil spirits the coldness which had gripped me in the darkness and my sudden sinking into oblivion
Then this wakening and my search for Viola to appease my hun ger
Not for food
Not for drink
Not for love
new hunger
new hun ger known only at night new hun ger that made me shun men and forget my former self
new hunger that hated mirrors
hunger for Viola
moved toward her very slowly and my wet graveclothes rustled as reached out my hands reassuringly and took her in my arms
was sorry for her just for an instant then the hunger came stronger and bent my head
The last question rang in my brain once again
And how revived
The seance the threat of evil spirits an swered that question
answered it myself
knew why had risen from the grave and who and what was as took Viola in my arms
took Viola in my arms and my teeth met in her throat
That answered the question
was Vampire
Bottom Pool What the Fisher What the Bait
Martin Aylethorp Plumbs the Depths
Author of Liquid Life Major McCrarys Vision etc
IT WOULD be stupid of me to write this with the intention of saving my life
Of course shall be threatened with murder charge but they shall never be able to pro duce the body
Consequently they must eventually set me free
But there is possibility that may be held for sanity hearing
For that reason must pen this account and attach it to the other papers
It may serve to convince the officials at the in vestigation
And those officials must be convinced
They must be convinced because there is deed which they must do
It is imperative that they heed my plea and board up the bottomless pool in the swamp beyond Prichards Woods
They must board up the pool and drain the bogland fence it off if they cannot destroy it
Otherwise there will be further tragedies this swear is true
And until that black pool is boarded over shall never find the solace of sound sleep but will con RALPH MILNE FARLEY slid feet foremost in to the stygian waters STRANGE STORIES tinue to dream of that thing in the swamp the dark thing that took the life of my friend Martin Aylethorp
There was time when knew peace
Thats the mockery
My friend Martin had been in slump period he wrote for living and invited him East for the sole reason that thought wed find soothing tranquil lity at my home
My cottage is near Mill Brook just outside of Concord
Martin rea soned would enjoy tramping in Prioh ards Woods and in the fall the New England countryside takes on mel low beauty most conducive to easing shattered nerves
AS recall my preparation for his coming it seems like grim joke
was so careful in rigging up his room to insure its quiet even sent into town for noiseless portable to re place my regular typewriter
For when Martin arrived in late Au gust he was sick man
His tall nor mally lean figure was now emaciated his eyes were sunken behind his spec tacles and the smile had remembered as habitual upon his countenance seemed drowned by inward melan choly
He smoked too much and when he held cigarette the gray spirals rose from the tip unevenly because of the trembling of his hand
did my best to conceal my con cern over his changed appearance
He had been working on novel and try ing to hold down librarians job dur ing the day
gathered that he was completely done in and had lately found is impossible to continue with his short story work
It is amazing what creative effort can do to man of Martins peculiar temperament He was drained dry sucked of all vitality as though his nights had been given over to visits from vampire or suc cubus rather than writing
It isnt bad comparison for Martin Aylethorp wrote weird fiction
He wrote it intensely and it was his theory not mine that writing fantasy took more out of an author than work in any other field
His own person certainly seemed to be good proof of this contention
did my best for him
carefully avoided all topics of conversation which might relate to his work
did not show him any of my recent stuff
locked away all my reference books and magazines
And did not allow him to speak of his book
coaxed him into resting argued and bullied him with the notion of getting outdoor exercise interspersed with plenty of sleep
After week or so gradually augented the menu at meal time and encouraged him to eat
It worked
By the time September had passed he had regained his nor mal attitude and his health was once more back to par
Incidentally my self had gained six pounds
Soon proposed series of daily hikes in and about the local woods
Martin took to the idea and for the firt time learned that as boy he had often spent the summer with rela tives in Concord
He seemed eager as his health improved to revisit famil iar landmarks
Although had been at my cottage for over year was amazed at the unsuspected secrets of the countryside he uncovered
Soon he was acting as my guide and played the meekly following visitor to local shrines
As his physical wellbeing increased his normal interests were correspond ingly rearoused
Within several weeks he was talking stories and plots to me again and by the end of the month he was literally champing at the bit eager to get back into harness and do few tales
Although held out as long as could he insisted that he be allowed the use of my typewriter and our daily jaunts were now filled with his talk of proposed work and plans for stories
And then our hikes and his interest converged disastrously
One morning after breakfast he came into my room and yanked me out of my chair
Come on he urged
The suns high and were going for little ex ploring jaunt
Where to
Havent we covered all the local showplaces yet
This is no showplace he replied smiling
Its secret
Ill wager theres spot youve never seen and only mile away from here too
THE BOTTOMLESS POOL doubt that said
What kind of place is it
Martin assumed look of melodra matic grimness
Its called The Bottomless Pool he whispered Whats the gag
Im serious
Its in the swamp south of Prichards Woods
remem ber my gang explored it during one of the summers stayed here as kid
Its strange place George Graves warned us to stay away from it when we told him wed been there
He was the only grownup we ever spoke to about it and it was he who called the place The Bottomless Pool
He mentioned Walden Pond in Concord the place where Thoreau wrote his nature studies you know and said that it was bottomless too
It lies in hollow in the hills has nei ther inlet nor outlet yet the water is always fresh
Springs and subter ranean river cause that no doubt the glacier created some queer freaks hereabouts
But he said that Govern ment engineers once came to Walden to take soundings and there were spots in that pond that were deeper than their longest soundingwires
Thats what he meant by bottomless pool and he said that the one in Prichards Woods was similar
Well his warning just whetted our interest in the spot you see
Kids are like that guess
We got together all the fishline the gang could lay their hands on and tied it all together with lead weight on one end
Then we lowered it down into that sluggish black pool in the swamp
We never struck bottom
Well that sort of scared us its creepy place and we took the warning more seriously
never have gone back
That was my last summer at Concord and gradually lost track of the boys
But did hear something in letter once about Sam Dewey disappearing in the swamp the following year
Sam was the lad who suggested we take sound ings
Of course dont think his dis appearance had anything to do with his interest in the Bottomless Pool although it might have at that
He was foolhardy and George Graves when warning us hinted something about people who had fallen in
listened to all this with sort of tepid interest
But Martin seemed genuinely enthusiastic
Lets go take look at the place he urged
Its really weird spot and Ive got hunch theres story there somewhere
rose and obediently put on my boots
In my own solitary wanderings had avoided the mucky wooded depths of the old swamp and it was only to humor my guest that acceded to his request We struck out to the south and soon reached the swamp edge
rprfE swamp was awful
The limbs of dead trees interred the sun light and only the wan ghosts of its beams haunted the murky avenues of the morass
Rotten logs and slimy creepers covered slough of quick sand and bog through which floun dered at Martins heels
The instincts of boyhood guided him aright so that he avoided the gray bubbling patches of deeper ooze
He remarked over this voicing his amazement that after all these years the place seemed to be unchanged
At first it was the physical difficul ties we encountered which impressed me
Gradually however as we waded deeper into the dark swamp became more aware of other less tangible things
The place looked like death and smelled of deaths rottenness and decay
Moss and fungoid growths clung to the gray treetrunks bloated toadstools reared pulpy deaths heads on fat stemmed necks rising from the ooze
The bubbling of the swampjuices beneath our boots was silent kind of sound or rather noise that seemed to intensify the silence and at the same time to be part of it
There was no wind in the hanging branches and we saw neither bird nor animal in these depths
Still there had been life here once for we soon struck rickety old fence which wound in seemingly haphaz ard manner through the lower swamp
STRANGE STORIES Martin beckoning to me turned and followed the meandering wooden out lines until he came to the willow tree that bent over the ground before it
And there in the deep dark shade of the ancient boughs lay the Bottomless Pool
It was small barely six feet across and black
Jet black water motion less
The pool was like large un blinking eye with an odious green scum filming its pupil
Thats highly fantastic comparison but something about the pools ap pearance inspired such thoughts in me
It was strange and somehow unnatu ral
It wasnt right for this small pool to be here in the swamp and certainly the thing looked as evil as any natural formation Ive ever seen
MARTIN stood looking into the depths for few moments
The waters black too he murmured strange how in the presence of si lence the human voice is always hushed
The waters black as ink he said
And he dipped one hand into the pool brushing off the scummy froth and cupping ebon drops for me to see
The water was black and the decayed matter in it gave it veined appear ance it was striated with dark green rills
Place eery enough for you
asked Martin
Scared us when we were kids he observed
And wouldnt be too sure of my reactions now
But what set ting for story
had been staring into the silent water and now wondered what was generating the impulse in me to turn and run away
Were my own nerves bad
hastily averted my gaze
Martin shouted
He really spoke in normal tone of voice but in contrast to our previous hushed mur murs it was shout
Look at the lizard he exclaimed
Sure enough the surface of the black water had parted with widening rip ple and small dark lizard of some sort appeared
It floated on its back as though dead
reached down and grabbed it yanked it out
Why theres wire attached to it
The wire led down into the water
Just then there came pull on the line from within the pool
It yanked the little dead reptile right out of my hands but something attached to it caught in my coat cut right through it and dug painfully into my side
Im caught
cried as stepped toward the pfcl to ease the pain of the barb in my side
But now the wire line had tightened was drawing me in short jerks toward the brink of the black pool
grabbed the line with both hands braced my feet at the very edge and leaned backward
But the sod on which was standing crumbled and slid feet foremost into the Sty gian water
Martin leaped forward and grabbed me
With tremendous tug he hurled me back on the bank
Water coursed down my body and warm blood scalded the deep wound in my side
felt faint
Martin swore softly as he daubed iodine on the cut beneath my shirt and swore loudly at the pain
Neither of us were ready to comment but sud denly Martin turned his head and darted again to the edge of the pool
He pointed speechless
Another lizard larger than the first now rose to the surface of the pool
It bobbed and seemed to beckon
Martin scowled deeply pointed to my hookgashed side and growled out single word Bait
What bait
The lizard
snorted disgustedly
But ah the way home we marveled at the incident
We argued as changed into dry garments debated as bandaged my side mused during luncheon and speculated wildly all the long afternoon
Martin ever the imaginative had dozen fantastic theories
Who fished at the depths of the bot tomless pool
And with hooks
Some thing lived in the pool
Maybe some things
The somethings fished for men
As boy hadnt George Graves THE BOTTOMLESS POOL hinted about disappearances
And hadnt Sam Dewey vanished near the swamp
SOMETHING in the pool set traps for men putting lizards on hooks and using wire line
The Bot tomless Pool led to inner earth and there was life below
Thus Martin expressed himself halfseriously
To which offered the obvious re plies
The hook and line had been used by some fisherman
It had fallen into the water
Perhaps the lizard had been accidentally impaled upon the hook risen to the surface as it died and brought the line up
grabbed it got hooked and snag entangling the lines end under water had pulled me into the pool
But what about the second lizard we saw
Martin insinuated gently
was silent
Martin was grave for moment be fore continuing
remember as boy fishing for pickerel up Assabet
The boat rocked
was only about nine at the time but was smart fisher man
hooked big pickerel that day and the pickerel hooked me
gave him an uncomprehending glance
Line got wrapped around my foot and the fish pulled me out of the boat he laughed
Then in graver tones he went on If were fish and wanted to catch fisherman Id tangle him up in line
Take the Bot tomless Pool for example
If meant to capture whoever or whatever is fish ing for me from below Id grab that lizard bait and allow it to drag me in toward the pool
Then Id pull up more line and attach the wire to windlass rope
And then Id let go of the hook
The sudden release might precipitate the fisherman below over board into the water and tangle him up
Then by quickly winding in the windlass Id haul the fellow up to the surface
But thats absurd began
Theres no fisherman in the Bottomless Pool there cant be and besides How does your hooked side feel this evening
interjected Martin sar castically
Oh lets forget it grumbled
But didnt forget
dreamed that night
And Martin did not forget either
He spent the midnight hours at the typewriter taking notes for story
Neither of us however spoke again of the Bottomless Pool
The next day awoke with slight fever
The wound in my side was little inflamed and lay abed bath ing it with hot cloths to reduce the swelling
Martin after assuring him self that was not utterly helpless announced that he was going for walk
Id like to interview few old timers around here about that place he told me
There should be myths
forget what remark made but know that tried to laugh him out of his interest
Secretly was very much disturbed
My dreams had not been pleasant and the Bottomless Pool had figured rather too prominently in them
For moment had the wild notion that Martin was going off to try out his fishing theory
He seemed almost unnaturally interested per son of his temperament can be greatly influenced by imaginative concepts
He left on his purported mission of investigation and spent long day in dozing and dreaming
It was late afternoon when he returned greeted me brusquely and went in to the other room
In few moments heard the vibration of the noiseless typewriter
Rising got supper together
We ate but little fever had banished my own appetite and excitement seemed to grip Martin so that food could not interest him
Almost as soon as he sat down he launched into long babble of gossip he had picked up during the day
Old Bert Pickens down near the Cause way had known Martins parents he had filled my friend up with old Colonial tales and even some Indian lore hed heard as boy back in the seventies
There were stories about the swamp south of the woods specific cases of disappearances dating way back as far as community memory went
Visiting Granny Mercers cottage later in the day Martin had persuaded the always garrulous old woman to re STRANGE STORIES count her own family history
It was point of pride with the crone that her pure blood had at one time pro duced martyr during the Salem witchcraft hysteria and she warned Martin most gravely about the old pool
It was from her that he picked up his tale of the Indian rites in the swamp where the braves sometimes offered up sacrifices to the pitgod they believed dwelt in the pool cast ing bodies into the orifice
could see that Martin was more impressed with this lore than even he admitted he was very glib in patching together his yarn so that it formed an almost recognizable story sequence
He quoted from memory the words of Cotton Mather concerning gateways to Hell and openings in earth which lead to the Regions of the Damned
Indeed he weaved fine romance about the pool and did it so deftly that was forced to the conclusion that he halfbelieved some of it
Ill write it all up tonight he told me
Then must have another look at the place
You know theres some thing fascinating about all this its real mystery
Wouldnt it be remark able if there is some truth about my theories concerning the fishing
After all those lizards dont manufacture hook and wire
And some of these old wives tales are very definite
made no comment
went to bed early leaving Martin to type away in the next room as he had planned
My sleep was troubled and it must have been about midnight when woke in cold sweat and stumbled into the kitchen for water
The house was dark and still
passed through Mar tins room and noticed with start that his bed was empty
Fever left me
knew with an in explicable dread that Martin had gone
And knew too where he had gone
My first thought was that had overestimated his recovery
He might still be mentally ill the pool in the swamp had exercised morbid fasci nation on his mind
Poor judgment might have led him to see the thing by moonlight for the sake of captur ing story atmosphere
went back to bed but did not sleep
kept waiting for him to re turn
The night was long
trem bled with fever and with secret fear
It was not good thing to wander alone in the swamp by night
Quick sand and fog to say nothing of the possibilities of running into some prowler made the stunt dangerous
But after an hour had passed found that it was not this spectacle of actual apparent dangers which dis turbed me
began to think only of the pool itself and of the bait upon its black surface
Then it was that unreasoning panic gripped me
rose and bundled up tugged on my boots
snatched up my belt flashlight and ran out
SWEAR had no sense of time passing on my nocturnal trek in the woods
It seemed only fever filled instant before was already wading into that black jungle fring ing the swamp only mistwrapped moment before darted from hum mock to hummock in the rising fog calling Martins name
Only the frogs croaked an answer
Then was following the fencerail and finally grasped the willow trunk as stared down at the bank of the pool the bank of wet mud in which were implanted the fresh bootprints of human feet
They faced one way only toward the pool
And as they neared the edge they slurred into sort of sliding scoopedout impres sion as though the wearer had been dragged
Dragged into the black silent water from which the tiny bubbles now arose slowly slowly
screamed and ran back into the night
Fever held me the next day
But was glad for it kept me from think ing too much thinking about what had happened and also about what planned to do
didnt consider the possibility of suicide not when read the typed notes Martin had written the night be fore
The whole story of his belief lay there and there were incredible hints of what he expected to bring THE BOTTOMLESS POOL forth from the pool depths
At the last he spoke of the urge to revisit the scene and capture lizard for ex amination to see if it were of rec ognizable species and also to deter mine just how it had been killed
He wanted some wire also and one of the hooks
Then he would go ahead and try his plan
For he quite definitely had intended to use the windlass trick
learned that before the morning was over the delivery truck brought the order from the city
went sick as signed Martins name for the shipment
had sud den vision of him on the night be fore standing by the pool as he waited for the appearance of the bait then stooping to remove the reptile and being caught dragged
No it was not suicide
It was mur der
But by what means
Through burning delirium came the answer pictures conjured up from Indian legends and witchcraft whis perings
Dweller beneath the waters fishing for humankind and snaring the curious
fissure in the earths crust leading to some hellish subterranean cavern
And Martin go ing down down into the inky waters on the end of hook to be seized by what
would find out
The windlass and Martins scheme he would be avenged with his own plan his own instru ment
must have been little mad
talked and laughed to myself great deal as the day sped
gathered the equipment together at dusk and started for the swamp
An unhealthy nightfog was already rising when left Prichards Woods but though fever coursed through my veins plodded on
walked through night mare
The unseen frogs croaked dismal litany as stumbled through the bog
Tapers of fog rose dimly on all sides and smoky mist hung about my head
floundered through the gray dark ness lugging the windlass
Often sank ankledeep into puddles of bub bling slime
All about me in the night was rot tenness and decay and death and re call thinking that this putrescent swamp was but frame background setting for the black jewel of the bottomless pit
But the fog and the fever in my temples accounted for such wild fancies
Fog and fever conspired toward my feeling of unutterable loathing when first caught sight of the ebon waters upon the inky chasm in the center of the swamp
Fog and fever addled me so that monotonously cursed as anchored the windlass to big log set upon the firm higher ground of the bank
short rope from the drum of the windlass ran to the edge of the pool and ended in quicksettling clamp
There was detached part of me that carried out these operations with methodical precision and yet another part that inspired my cursings as crouched there in the forest darkness of the heaving breathing swamp
BENEATH my feet the quicksand thrummed and groaned and re call that wild picture rose in my mind
had fantastic image of my self crouching upon the epidermis of some gigantic monster as though the swamp itself were just the skin of vast beast and the bottomless black pit tiny pinprick in the flesh
But that too was fog and fever
The preparations were made
had not even glanced at the scummy sur face of the pool so sure was of what my eyes must encounter
Now with the drum ready for use and the wind lass securely placed gazed into the dark depths and jerked on the flash light wore at my belt
Its rays disclosed the floating blue body of tiny lizard bobbing monoto nously upon the surface of the cryptic waters
There it lay in death rising and sinking upon water that did not move
And that fact inspired me with the terrible fear of corroboration for poor Martins story
stared at the creature fighting the fog and fever that created gray mist upon my brain until the only thought distinguishable was panic impulse to STRANGE STORIES flee the spot
rocked on my heels when wished to run screaming back across the bog to spot where Nature is sane and friendly
And then felt in my pocket for the wireclipper had found on Martins desk
For some absurd reason the cold feel of the prosaic factorycut metal reassured me
And with my free hand reached out and snatched at the blue lizard
tugged the body from the water in the beam of the flashlight on the bank and the clear yellow beam was cut by black line
The lizard was wired
Seizing the clamp next to me quickly clipped the wire to the windlass rope
Then yanked on the wire with both hands
shudder ran through me for felt dreadful unmistakable response from the other end of the line
Through the water it tightened jerked
SOMEONE below was pulling on the rope
Someone was fishing
But who
And from how far below
The tugger was strong
In sudden desperation felt my heels slide along the bank
Powerful jerks were draw ing me close to the black brink of that dark still pool
With gasp let go
The line whipped back into the water
In my minds eye formed silly senseless picture of fisherman standing on his wharf then falling over backwards as the catch released his line
An idiotic picture it was for there could be no fisherman at the bottom of bottomless pool
Or could there be
would soon know
The line fell back then reached the spot where had clamped it to the windlass rope
There it snapped taut
The fisherman had fallen overboard
He had been hooked
laughed with out mirth at the insane thought
And then gripped the windlass handle and turned the drum and felt terrific threshing tauten the line until it stood straight in the flash lights beam again
The wire began to snap back and forth in the black waters of thi
turned and turned hundred thousand revolu tions were made in augmenting frenzy for now desperately realized that each crank was bringing me closer and closer to the secret of the bottomless pool
Suddenly the winch jammed
stared in dismay then saw that the drum was full
Then leapt in front of the windlass and grabbed the re maining wire in my hands
It took second but experienced year
Through fever and fog came images of what might expect to find at the end of my line
Martins bloated corpse blue and swollen with the line gripped between death clenched teeth
the shapeless body of child long mired in the slime of the pit
But no it could not be
There was fisher down there fisher that baited cunningly this hook and sent wire line upwards to entrap children and wanderers and curious men
And the fisher had taken Martin and was now entangled in this line
fisher in black and bottomless pool was drawing in fisher from Below
The rays of the flashlight on the bank now gleamed upon the surface of the scummy waters but they were still no longer
In oozing eddies they bubbled and swirled and black slime was tossed upwards as drew th cut ting wire through my hands
ter rific force was pulling against me and fright alone conspired to intensify the strength of my grip
At that moment would gladly have released my hold but sheer hysteria made my muscles rigid
Slowly inexorably drew the final length of the wire from the water in the yellow light
The Fisher emerged
cannot remember if screamed aloud but there was the sound made by utter fear ringing and crashing against my brain
For saw the crea ture of the pit saw the strangled neck about which the tangling wire had wound and allowed me to pull the Fisher upwards
saw what filled the sixfoot surface of the pool as it emerged
It was head shaped by horrors dreams alone
Not human not rep tilian not froglike it was neverthe THE BOTTOMLESS POOL less featured with great staring yellow eyes snouted like saurian and cov ered with greenish batrachoid skin that glistened slickly against the yel low light
The monstrous bulging eyes rolled wildly and dilated in agony as the creature opened its great slitted mouth in soundless choking gasp
stared into red maw that was fanged in manner unknown to any beast still roaming earth and as did so sickening realization swept over me
This was the Fisher
An instant only did that gigantic glistening head rise greenly above the waters of the pool then my clippers were out the wire snapped with shrill twang and the Fisher from Be low sank beneath the bubbling black waves with thunderous splash of slime
stared down blankly into the depths as the waters quickly became quiescent once again
could see nothing but did not wish to
did not wish to learn what man ner of horrid life flourished unnatu rally at the bottom of this opening wherever that bottom might be
did not care to speculate upon the cun ning intelligence of primal entity which even now fished for men from its lair in the black deep
did not think could endure surmises which now clamored for consideration
Was this the only creature of its kind or were there more down there
What inversion of sane natural laws allowed existence in nighted depths and what manner of ghastly intelli gence prompted prehistoric beasts to set bait for men
Were there other such openings in the earths conceal ing crust through which the madness below had access to humanity
But what most devoutly tried to keep from thinking about was the scraped sides of the poolbank and the reasons for it
Only the head of the monster had emerged and it had filled the pool
The sides were scraped by the shoulders and the six foot pool bad not been wide enough to permit the passage of the body
Fog and fever were merciful re leases
know that dumped the windlass in the pool and it sank like plummet and dimly remember running back through the swamp
EWAS ill the next few days and then the police came and told them what dared
They have seen the pool but they have said nothing of their opinion to me
told them more today and will tell them all know soon not to preserve my free dom but because now want the spot boarded up
It must be lest others see the bait It must be boarded up for it cannot be filled up
shall tell them soon or let them read this
They can think me de mented if they like but trust they believe enough to act and act promptly
Perhaps if even then they do not believe may show them the hook have tre hook from the wire in the pool which cut off
hate to reveal it to them for detest the very memory of the thing myself
It is made of some golden metal harder than pure gold
It is cut and rudely shaped and dislike to con ceive of the creatures who deliber ately formed it for its horrid purpose and made the wire to which it was attached
cannot bear to think of the civilization behind such creative effort
And worst of all is the memory of those designs in the metal
Those designs created by what primal artist
There are three of them cut into the gold surface
They tell all so that know only too well why the Fishers seek men with bait from their bottomless pits
The first design is tiny like the rest but it unmistakably depicts creature such as the one whose head saw
dare not describe the body which is shown here
But the creature is bait ing hook
The second little design is crude representation of man falling through water at the end of line as Martin must have fallen
And the third design but must not speak of that tells of what Mar tins fate was tells why the Fishers fish
That third hellish design on the hookl It shows feast
The Bottomless Pool must be boarded up

IT WAS not dream
Despite the fact that she had distinctly re membered going to bed as last conscious effort after the stormy in terview with Artemus Eusso Mar jorie Westbrook knew as she had known about other weird instances in her life that this was stark and cold reality
There was no state of transition between the pleasant business of re tiring and this instinct awareness of an incredible situation
Simply she had gone to bed in her lovely cham ber at home in Forest Hills as Mar jorie Westbrook heiress to the Westbrook Motor millions her mind filled with business details over the present policies of the late George Westbrooks automobile factories
And here she was wide awake and standing before an altar in front of her an altar of ancient Egyptian motif with the sacred ibis projecting in relief at the ends like figureheads of ships
She stood in her bare feet upon cold floor of tesselated marble
More over the satin nightdress the last item of dress she remembered don ning was gone
She stood there in complete nudity but she was con scious of no sense of shame or mod esty
Without seeing it for she was powerless to turn she was aware of an immensity of space which ex Tie crystal ball turned inky black tended in all directions behind her space blocked out with intangible green mist that was almost black and almost of the density of velvet drapes At her right hand was an upright sarcophagus with the lid removed
Within the musty and spicily pun gent interior was the wrapped figure of mummy mummy which queerly enough was headless
It was all like closing her eyes upon scene in cinema for an in stant to open them upon sudden change of locale
With this signifi FULFILLMENT cant difference there was no con tinuity no relevance no congruity no connection between her life and this grotesque pattern
There were of course her previous experiences those strange uncanny interludes in her otherwise prosaic life
But there was no tangi ble connection unless you considered the sarcophagus which looked ex actly like the one she had purchased some months before even to the headless mummy in the musty in terior
Somehow and Marjorie could not explain it that sarcophagus which should have been in her boudoir was here with her in this other world
That Egyptian sarcophagus as soon as she had seen it she had been re solved to possess it
Its fascination for her had been but the apex of an amazing sequence of bizarre oc currences and it blended as perfect complement with those ex periences
Marjorie now became aware that just beyond the altar before which she stood was the figure of man in cowled crimson robe his hands busy at set of dials and buttons before him
And the craziest and most outre part of it all was the monks face
He was Art emus Russo general manager of Westbrook Mo tors
Yet there was strangeness about him that was not Russo
Before she had time to cry out to question him to demand an explana tion Marjorie noticed the light
She was outlined in glow of light like psychic aura of unbelievable in tensity shading from pure white to garish green mantling her in bath of living light
As she stared down at her lovely form to her horror she saw the flesh become translucent transparent and finally invisible and the skeletal structure of her body from neck to toe became hide ously revealed in glowing pink
Still bound by invisible chains which kept her motionless but with out pain Marjorie heard the cowled figure speak and the tones of his voice awakened thousand memories in her mind memories which were not of the welltailored Artemus Russo who shouted so irately about proxies and assets and common stock of Westbrook Motors Inc The hour has come Princess he said to fulfill your destiny
she gasped giving him name which came easily from her lips
am not ready
Her own answer startled her pro foundly shook her to the depths of her soul
That was what made these bizarre occurrences in her life so distressing
It implied knowledge on her part of monstrous things from the womb of time about which she as Marjorie Westbrook should have known noth ing
But she did know
Even now answering so easily to the title of princess yet aware of herself as Marjorie Westbrook she remem bered similar experiences
THE first had happened when she was child of ten
Without warn ing she had passed from safely mundane world to shadowy temple of vast halls and towering pillars
Going to bed all tired out from day of happy play falling quickly asleep suddenly she was standing before high altar whose sides were frieze of jackalheaded dolls of angular lines
Or were they dolls
How was little girl of ten to know
Yet they were not strange to her
Without knowing how she knew she was as familiar with the symbol of Anubis as she was with her own sis ter the twin who had always walked beside her
With start she realized that another little girl was standing with her before that forbidding altar with its plume of curling incense
The little companion was an exact duplicate of herself dressed in archaic headdress and queerly draped robe of costly silk with beaten gold design in the hem
On her ankles and arms bracelets glittered one in the form of coiled serpent with eyes of emerald green
This was Isames
Without being told Marjorie knew that her own name was Isira
It had always been Isira for ten years of Egyptian childhood as princess of the royal STRANGE STORIES blood
There was no Marjorie West brook in this consciousness and yet she knew she was Marjorie West brook and that Sir Gerwain was wait ing for her out in her fathers ken nels
In way it was terrifying and Marjorie Isira whimpered
Be brave Isira whispered Isa mes
It is our heritage
Before Marjorie could reply there was movement behind the altar and Ankhtares high priest of Ammon cold and stern man with the features of Artemus Russo her fathers secre tary swam into view
There was strange light in his piercing black eyes as he looked out and down upon the two little girls who stood before the altar to the dead tightly clasp ing each others hands
Princess Isira and Princess Isa mes he spoke in sonorous voice which echoed hollowly through the great hall of the temple in accord ance with the rule of your house blessed under the sign of the cruK ansata and dedicated to the service of Ra you are here to choose your destiny
Are you prepared
We are prepared Ankhtares Marjorie heard herself and her sister reply
That the language was not modern English she did not even note
The high priest passed his hand above the curling incense rising from the altar in cabalistic sign and blue smoke fairly boiled up in writh ing convolutions that had sparks of incandescent red
The figure of the high priest was obscured for mo ment and both little girls trembled
Then he came back into view
In this the third era in the sec ond dynasty of Ptolemy his com pelling voice rolled out it is writ ten in the Seventh Book of Anubis that of twin princes or princesses of the direct line of Pharaoh only one can ascend to the throne
Herein lies the parting paths of destiny
For one there is the sceptre of queen wealth and glory and power and death before her youth has faded
For the other there is timeless void until her spirit shall find life and happiness in future existence and then she shall grow old before her time
And in the end the twain shall be reunited by bond far stronger than that of natal ties
It is so writ ten
Choose well ye little princesses
Behold the sacred ibis awaits to carry the word to Ammon Giver of all
Both little girls clung together and quivered in wideeyed fright as they saw the blue smoke take the form of the sacred bird
The words of the high priest were incomprehen sible to them but they stared at the shadowy bird of Ra and spoke bravely
want to be queen said Isa mes
want to be happy said Isira
With puff of smoke the nebu lous ibis disappeared
So be it
said the voice of Ankh tares
There was flash of blinding light and little Marjorie Westbrook opened her eyes to find the looming sun streaming in at the window and to hear the excited yelping of Sir Ger wain her wolfhound outside
That had happened when she was ten
Now at twentyfive in the very midst of undergoing similar ex perience she was able to recall that earlier one
SHE stared down in mounting sort of mental fear as she watched her body entirely disappear from be neath her leaving only the faintly glowing frame of her bony struc ture
And as she watched even that began to fade away in the bath of terrible light the source of which she could not determine
Soon she would be disembodied head floating above the strange floor
The hour is at hand Princess Isira said the cowled priest for the fulfillment of your destiny
The sands of time have run their inter minable course
Beyond human com prehension is the working of the Infi nite
You behold on your right the sarcophagus of Isames queen of the Nile taken unto the arms of Anubis and Thoth in her twentysixth year
Alas only her chu preserved body remains
Her ka soul bird with hu man head has departed for the sun FULFILLMENT temple of Amraon Her sacred crypt was violated by Vandals and dese crators of the dead but you can be hold her likeness on the lid of the sarcophagus in beaten gold
Marjorie Westbrook or the con sciousness that was Marjorie West brook stared at the cover of the ornate case and nearly swooned in astonishment She recalled the face on the lid of her own sarcophagus the one in her boudoir and how its haunting familiarity had puzzled arid intrigued her
But always it bad remained vague and dim
Now like the sensitized image on print that has just been withdrawn from de veloping fluid the golden features bathed in that eerie glow were exact duplicates of her own
It was as though she stared into burnished mirror of gold
Even the wide star ing eyes seemed alive with the color and expression of her own eyes
And still this fantastic this outre and bizarre experience was no dream
Majorie Westbrook was as thor oughly awake as she would ever be
Never since that soulshaking and impossible thing which had happened to her at the age of ten had she ex perienced awake or asleep any fur ther manifestation which included so much as mention of the lost Isames
In her nocturnal materializations and there had been at least one for every year of her life she had never again seen this strange twin sister or heard of her until now
It came to Marjorie with dreadful thrill that she was in her own twentysixth year right now
Not once during her entire life had she ever mentioned these weird ad ventures to anyone not even to her doctor
It was closed and sealed book from the world from even Mar jorie herself except in the throes of the fantastic episodes
But it was not dream life she knew that
It was some horrible destiny an actual and solid fate of terrific force and dim unguessed purpose that stalked her
And it did not feed solely upon the hours of night mere figment of her imagination
There was that day when she was seventeen and her father had taken her to the county fair
Normal happy lighthearted girl of modern age she had clapped her hands in delight when the old Gipsy hag in the gaycolored booth wanted to tell her fortune
But no sooner had Marjorie seated herself across the table of sand from the woman than the crystal ball thereon turned inky black
The woman started in utter dismay and quickly flung cloth over the ball
She blanched almost white as she stared with her sharp black eyes into Marjories blue ones
Let me see your right hand she said in tense whisper
Obligingly Marjorie stretched out her slim and girlish hand palm up
Without touching her the Gipsy stared with bulging eyes her golden earrings adance with violent agita tion
No she whispered
No no cannot read your destiny child
But that isnt fair pouted Mar jorie
Ive paid you silver dollar
You must read my fortune
Here is your money said the old woman beginning to shake all over
wont have it back declared Marjorie defiantly
Keep it and read my fortune
rairiE Gipsy groaned
cannot she articulated with difficulty
dare not
see only that you have double existence
You will grow old before your time incredibly old
How old
demanded Marjorie thinking the Gipsy was putting on very good act
Perhaps perhaps six thousand years choked out the other and then with wild cry the woman fled from the booth
That experience had taken place in broad daylight had occurred to Mar jorie Westbrook without any transi tion into another entity another sphere of life
So she knew she was not crazy
And she knew she did not dream these yearly episodes which wove that strange irrelevant and inexplicable pattern through her STRANGE STORIES otherwise normal and sane existence
she cried out in horror now against dread of she knew not what as her skeleton completely dis appeared
But her protests were as naught to this high priest of Ammon who was the counterpart of Artemus Russo
And Marjorie became aware of pair of hands cold and clammy as early morning fog off the Sound which gripped her head
She rolled her eyes to see greengray figure that had materialized behind her dis embodied spirit that was human only in outline an elemental even an ectoplasmic projection of Ankhtares
She opened her mouth to scream in terror but no sound came
She thought she was in silent world of chimeras
And the creature carried her bodyless head like football across the intervening space and set it firmly on the shoulders of the linenwrapped mummy within the sarcophagus
Thy destiny has been fulfilled came the voice of Ankhtares
At last we shall both have peace
There was that blinding flash of light which Marjorie Westbrook had come to know so well and every thing went into the oblivion of noth ingness
MARJORIE opened her eyes
The maid was letting in the sunshine
She was safe at home in her own bed in Forest Hills the covers drawn snugly up to her chin
Miss Westbrook said the maid softly it is eleven oclock
Mr Russo is waiting to see you in the sitting room
He insisted that wake you as he has to attend that board meeting
He said he must have your final word
Marjorie smiled
Her personal re lief was so great that she felt in most melting mood toward the man ager of her affairs
Very well she said
Tell him am ready to sign those proxies for him and wind things up
Wait help me up first
She threw back the silken coverlet preparatory to sitting up
Bring over the She broke off in stunned horror
As she moved it sounded like the rattling of parchment and dried bones
As she tossed back the cover instead of satin night negligee from Paris upon the lovely body of twentyfiveyearold beauty she ex posed the graybrown and dried skin of an Egyptian mummy
Her hands were two shrunken claws the outline of the bones showing plainly from elbow to fingers
One terrible shriek Marjorie West brook gave ere death overtook her
The horrible episodes of her noc turnal life had finally broken through the barrier that had always sur rounded and protected her had over taken her at last
The six thousand years were up
The maid stared petrified at the lovely head perfectly joined to that of the sixthousandyearold mummy of an Egyptian woman
Her eyes rolled wildly to corner of the room where her mistress prized sarcopha gus stood and she screamed
The lid was off and the headless mummy that should have reposed in the case was gone
Mr Russo
she cried as she fled to the outer room
Her voice choked cut off abruptly as she stared at the couch where she had left the general manager sitting
Ly ing fulllength on the couch was Arte mus Russo his body as still as death and his face parchment yellow and amazingly horribly wrinkled with lines that told of the passage of cen turies

heard sickening crunch and saw one of the bells smash down on Sarto Bells of Horror By KEITH HAMMOND Author of The Hand of Ahrimana
The Invaders etc
Then star nor sun shall waken Nor any change of light Nor sound of waters shaken Nor any sound or sight Nor wintry leaves nor vernal Nor days nor things diurnal Only the sleep eternal In an eternal night
GREAT deal of curiosity has been aroused by the strange affair of the lost bells of Mis sion San Xavier
Many have wondered why when the bells were discovered after remaining hidden for over hundred and fifty years they were al most immediately smashed and the fragments buried secretly
In view of the legends of the remarkable tone and quality of the bells number of musicians have written angry letters asking why at least they were not rung before their destruction and permanent record made of their music
As matter of fact the bells were rung and the cataclysmic thing that STRANGE STORIES happened at that time was the direct reason for their destruction
And when those evil bells were shrieking out their mad summons in the unprece dented blackness that shrouded San Xavier it was only the quick action of one man that saved the world yes do not hesitate to say it from chaos and doom
As secretary of the California His torical Society was in position to witness the entire affair almost from its inception
was not present of course when the bells were unearthed but Arthur Todd the president of the society telephoned me at my home in Los Angeles soon after that illfated discovery
He was almost too excited to speak coherently
Weve found them
he kept shouting
The bells Ross
Found them last night back in the Pinos Range
Its the most remarkable discovery since since the Rosetta Stone
What are you talking about
asked groping in fog of drowsiness
The call had brought me from my warm bed
The San Xavier bells of course he explained jubilantly
Ive seen them myself
Just where Junipero Serra buried them in
hiker found cave in the Pinos and ex plored it and there was rotting wooden cross at the end with carving on it
brought What did the carving say
broke in
Oh just minute have it here
Listen Let no man hang the evil bells of the Mutsunes which lie buried here lest the terror of the night rise again in Nueva California
The Mutsunes you know were sup posed to have had hand in casting the bells
know said into the transmit ter
Their shamans were supposed to have put magic spell on them
Im Im wondering about that Todd said
There have been some very unusual things happening up here
Ive only got two of the bells out of the cave
Theres another you know but the Mexicans wont go in the cave any more
They say well theyre afraid of something
But Ill get that bell if have to dig it up my self
Want me to come up there
If you will Todd said eagerly
Im phoning from cabin in Coyote Canyon
left Denton my assistant in charge
Suppose send boy down to San Xavier to guide you to the cave
All right assented
Send him to the Xavier Hotel
Ill be there in few hours
SAN XAVIER is perhaps hun dred miles from Los Angeles
raced along the coast and within two hours had reached the little mission town hemmed in by the Pinos Range drowsing sleepily on the edge of the Pacific
found my guide at the hotel but he was oddly reluctant to return to Todds camp
can tell you how to go Senor
You will not get lost
The boys dark face was unnaturally pale beneath its heavy tan and there was lurking dis quiet in his brown eyes
dont want to go back jingled some coins
Its not as bad as all that is it
Afraid of the dark
He flinched
Si the the dark its very dark in that cave Senor
The upshot was that had to go alone trusting to his directions and mv own ability in the open
Dawn was breaking as started up the canyon trail but it was strangely dark dawn
The sky was not overcast but it held curious gloom
have seen such oppressively dark days dur ing dust storms but the air seemed clear enough
And it was very cold although even from my height could see no fog on the Pacific
kept on climbing
Presently found myself threading the gloomy chill recesses of Coyote Canyon
shivered with cold
The sky was dull leaden color and found myself breathing heavily
In good physical condition the climb had tired me un duly
Yet was not physically tired it was rather an aching oppressive leth argy of mind
My eyes were watering and found myself shutting them occasionally to relieve the strain BELLS OF HORROR wished the sun would come over the top of the mountain
Then sawsomething extraordinary and horrible
It was toad gray fat ugly
It was squatting beside rock at the side of the trail rubbing itself against the rough stone
One eye was turned toward me or rather the place where the eye should have been
There was no eye there was only slimy little hollow
The toad moved its ungainly body back and forth sawing its head against the rock
It kept uttering harsh little croaks of pain and in moment it had withdrawn from the stone and was dragging itself across the trail at my feet
stood looking at the stone nause ated
The gray surface of rock was bedaubed with whitish streaks of fetor and the shredded bits of the toads eye
Apparently the toad had deliberately ground out its protruding eyes against the rock
It crept out of sight beneath bush leaving track of slime in the dust of the trail
involuntarily shut my eyes and rubbed them and suddenly jerked down my hands startled at the rough ness with which my fists had been dig ging into my eyesockets
Lancing pain shot through my temples
Re membering the itching burning sen sation in my eyes shuddered little
Had the same sort of torture caused the toad deliberately to blind itself
My God
RAN on up the trail
Presently passed cabin probably the one from which Todd had telephoned for saw wires running from the roof to tall pine
knocked at the door
No answer
continued my ascent
Suddenly there came an agonized scream knifeedged and shrill and the rapid thudding of footsteps
stopped listening
Someone was run ning down the trail toward me and behind him could hear others racing shouting as they ran
Around bend in the trail man came plunging
He was Mexican and his black stubbled face was set in lines of ter ror and agony
His mouth was open in square of agony and insane screams burst horribly from his throat
But it wasnt that that sent me stag gering back out of his path cold sweat bursting out on my body
His eyes had been gouged out and twin trickles of blood dripped down his face from black gaping hollows
As it happened there was no need for me to halt the blinded mans fran tic rush
At the curve of the trail he smashed into tree with frightful force and momentarily stood upright against the trunk
Then very slowly he sagged down and collapsed in limp huddle
There was great splotch of blood on the rough bark
went over to him quickly
Four men came running toward me
recognized Arthur Todd and Den ton his assistant
The other two were obviously laborers
Todd jerked to halt
Good God is he dead
Swiftly he bent over to examine the unconscious man
Denton and stared at each other
Denton was tall stronglybuilt man with shock of black hair and broad mouth that was generally expanded in grin
Now his face bore look of horrified disbelief
God Ross he did it right before our eyes Denton said through pale lips
He just let out scream threw up his hands and tore his eyes out of their sockets
He shut his own eyes at the memory
Todd got up slowly
Unlike Den ton he was small wiry nervously energetic with lean brown face and amazingly alert eyes
Dead he said
Whats happened
asked trying to keep my voice steady
Whats wrong Todd
Was the man insane
And all the while had picture of that fat toad tearing out its eyes against rock
Todd shook his head his brows drawn together in frown
dont know
Ross do your eyes feel odd
shiver ran through me
Damned odd
Burning and itching
Ive been rubbing them continually on the way up
So have the men Denton told me
So have we
He pointed to his eyes and saw that they were red rimmed and inflamed
The two laborers Mexicans came over to us
One of them said some STRANGE STORIES thing in Spanish
Todd barked sharp order and they fell back hesitating
Then without further parley they took to their heels down the trail
Denton started forward with an angry shoot but Todd caught his arm
No use he said quickly
Well have to get the bells out ourselves
You found the last one
asked as he turned back up the trail
We found them all three Todd said somberly
Denton and dug up the last one ourselves
And we found this too
HE drew dirtencrusted greenish metal tube from his pocket and gave it to me
Within the cylinder was sheet of parchment in remarkably good state of preservation
puzzled over the archaic Spanish script
Let me Todd said taking it care fully
He translated expertly
On the twentyfirst of June by the favor of God the attack by the pagan Mutsunes having been repulsed the three bells cast month ago were bur ied in this secret cave and the entrance sealed but landslide obviously opened it up again recently Todd broke off to explain
Inasmuch as evil witchcraft was practiced by the Indians when we sus pended and rang the bells the evil demon whom the Mutsunes call Za chequon was called from his dwelling beneath the mountains and brought the black night and the cold death among us
The large cross was over thrown and many of the people were possessed of the evil demon so that the few of us who retained our senses were hard put to it to overcome their fiendinspired attack and remove the bells
Afterward we gave thanks to God for our preservation and gave aid to those who were injured in the fray
The souls of those who perished were commended to God and we prayed that the San Antonio would soon ar rive to relieve us from this cruel soli tude
charge whomever may find these bells should it not please God to allow me to fulfill this duty to send them to Rome in the name of our mas ter the king
May God guard him
Todd paused and carefully returned the parchment to its case
Junipero Serra signed it he said quietly
Lord what find
But surely you dont think theres any thing Who said did
Todd snapped in voice that betrayed his nervous ten sion
Theres some logical explana tion superstition and autosugges tion are bad combination
Wheres Sarto
Denton asked with note of apprehension in his voice
We were standing at the edge of little clearing bare and rocky
He has the cabin down the trail Todd said
You must have passed it
left him here with the bells when Jose had his seizure
Hadnt we better get Joses body to town
Todd frowned
Dont think me bru tal he said
But these bells cant leave them here
The mans dead
We cant help him and itll take all three of us to get the bells to town
Its too bad the poor chap didnt have Dentons sense of direction he finished with grim smile
He wouldnt have run into the tree then
He was right
believe that Denton could have traversed the entire trail blindfolded after having once as cended it
He had remarkable mem ory and sense of direction like those Indians who could unerringly find their way to their wigwams across hundreds of miles of wilderness
Later this trait of Dentons was to be of vital importance but no premonition of this came to us at the time
We had climbed the rocky mountain slope above the clearing and had come out in little glade among the pines
Nearby was gaping hollow in the ground around it evidence of re cent landslide
Where the devil
Todd said star ing around
How Hes gone Denton said in amaze ment
And the bells with him Then we heard it faint hollow musical note the sound of bell hit ting wood
It came from above us and glancing up the slope we saw an odd sight
man gaunt bearded with blazing thatch of red hair was tugging at rope he had stretched over the ELLS OF HORROR branch af pine
At the other end of the rope Slowly they rose silhouetted against the sky the lost bells of San Xavier
Gracefully curved they glowed bronze even beneath their stains and verdigris and they were silent for they had no clappers
Once or twice they swung against the trunk of the pine and sent out hollow mournful note
How the man could lift that great weight was inexplicable could see the muscles cord and knot on his bare arms as he strained
His eyes were bulging and his teeth clenched in grinning mouth
Denton cried starting to clamber up the slope
What are you doing
STARTLED the man jerked his head around and stared at us
The rope slipped through his fingers and we saw the bells plunge down
With frightful effort he clutched the rope and halted their descent momentarily but the strain threw him off balance
He tottered overbalanced and came crashing down the slope and behind him overtaking him rolled and bounded the bells throbbing and booming as they clashed against rocks
God heard Todd whisper
The mad fool
There was maelstrom of dust and flying shale on the slope above
heard sickening crunch and Denton threw himself desperately aside
Through the dust saw one of the bells smash down on the sliding body of Sarto and then was stumbling away scrub bing furiously at my eyes blinded by the flying particles of dirt
The rattle and roar subsided slowly as clung to tree
blinked glanced around
Almost at my feet was one of the bells
There was great crimson stain upon it
The body of Sarto was visible jammed into bush on the slope above
And few feet below it propped upright against jagged rock was Sartos battered gory head
Thus ended the first act of the drama was to witness
The bells were to be hung two weeks later
There was some stir in the news papers and considerable more among historians

Xavicr from all over the world were planned
In the cold daylight of logic out side the eerie atmosphere of the Pinos Mountains the unusual occurrences during the unearthing of the bells were easily explained
virulent kind of poisoning perhaps similar to poison oak or some fungus hidden in the cave with the relics had been respon sible for our optical irritation and the madness of Sarto and the Mexican
Neither Denton Todd nor denied this explanation but we discussed the matter at length among ourselves
Denton went so far as to drive down to the Huntington Library to view the forbidden Johann Negus translation of the Book of lod that abhorrent and monstrous volume of ancient esoteric formulae about which curious legends still cling
Only single copy of the original volume written in the pre human Ancient Tongue is said to ex ist
Certainly few even know of the expurgated Johann Negus translation but Denton had heard vague rumors about passage in the book which he declared might be connected with the legends of the San Xavier bells
When he returned from Los Angeles he brought sheet of foolscap paper covered with his execrable penman ship
The passage he had copied from the Book of lod was this The Dark Silent One dwelleth deep be neath the earth on the shore of the West ern Ocean
Not one of those potent Old Ones from hidden worlds and other stars is He for in earths hidden blackness He hath always dwelt
No name hath He for He is the ultimate doom and the undying emptiness and silence of Old Night
When earth is dead and lifeless and the stars pass into the blackness He will rise again and spread His dominion over all
For He hath naught to do with life and sunlight but loveth the blackness and the eternal silence of the abyss
Yet can He be called to earths surface before His time and the brown ones who dwell on the shore of the Western Ocean have power to do this by ancient spells and certain deeptoned sounds which reach His dwell ingplace far below
But there is great danger in such summoning lest He spread death and night before His time
For He bringeth dark ness within the day and blackness within the light all life all sound all movement passeth away at His coming
He cometh sometimes within the eclipse and althoagh He hath no name the brown ones know Him as Zushakon
There was deletion at that point Denton said as glanced up from the excerpt
The books expurgated you know
Its very odd Todd said picking up the paper and running his eyes over it
But of course its merely coincidence
Certainly since folklore is based on natural phenomena one can generally find modern parallels
The thunderbolts of Jove and Apollos arrows are merely lightning and sun stroke
Never on them does the shining sun look down with his beams Den ton quoted softly
But deadly night is spread abroad over these hapless men Remember Odysseus visit to the Land of the Dead
TODDS mouth twisted wryly
Well what of it
dont expect Pluto to come up from Tartarus when the bells are hung
Do you
This is the twentieth century such things dont happen in fact never did happen
Are you sure
Denton asked
Surely you dont pretend to believe this cold weather were having is nor mal
glanced up quickly
had been wondering when someone would men tion the abnormal chill in the air
Its been cold before Todd said with sort of desperate assurance
And overcast too
Just because were having some muggy weather is no rea son for you to let your imagination get the upper hand
Its good God
We went staggering across the room
Earthquake Denton gasped and we headed for the door
We didnt race for the stairs but remained just beneath the lintel of the doorway
During an earthquake its the safest place in any building on account of the nature and strength of its con struction
But there were no more shocks
Denton moved back into the room and hurried to the window
Look he said breathlessly beck oning
Theyre hanging the bells
We followed him to the window
From it we could see the Mission San BELLS OF HORROR Xavier two blocks away and in the arches in the bell tower figures were toiling over the three bells
They say when the bells were cast the Indians threw the body of living girl into the boiling metal Denton said apropos of nothing
know it Todd answered snap pishly
And the shamans enchanted the bell with their magic
Dont be fool
Why shouldnt some peculiar vi bration like the sound of bell create certain unusual conditions
Denton asked hotly and thought detected note of fear in his voice
We dont know all there is to know about life Tcdd
It may take strange forms or even Clanggg
The booming ominous note of bell rang out
It was strangely deep thrill ing through my eardrums and sending its eerie vibration along my nerves
Denton caught his breath in gasp
deeper note throbbing sending curious pain through my head
Some how urgent summoning
Clang ggclanggg
thunder ing fantastic music such as might issue from the throat of god or from the heartstrings of the dark angel Israfel
Was it growing darker
Was shadow creeping over San Xavier
Was the Pacific darkening from spar kling blue to leaden gray to cold blackness
Then felt it premonitory trem ble of the floor beneath my feet
The window rattled in its casing
felt the room sway sickeningly tilt and drop while the horizon seesawed slowly madly back and forth
heard crashing from below and picture dropped from the wall to smash against the floor
Denton Todd and were swaying and tottering drunkenly toward the door
Somehow felt that the build ing wouldnt stand much more
It seemed to be growing darker
The room was filled with hazy tenebrous gloom
Someone screamed shrilly

STERLINE Ohio Ave Sidney Ohio STRANGE STORIES Continued from page spurt of dust spray out from the wall and bit of plaster dropped away
And suddenly went blind
At my side Denton cried out abruptly and felt hand grip my arm
That you Ross
heard Todd ask in his calm voice precise as ever
Is it dark
Thats it Denton said from some where in the blackness
Im not blind then
Where are you
Wheres the door
violent lurch of the building broke Todds clutch on my arm and was flung against the wall
Over here shouted above the crashing and roar ing
Follow my voice
In moment felt someone fum bling against my shoulder
It was Denton and soon Todd joined him
Whats happening
jerked out
Those damned bells Denton shouted in my ear
The Book of Iod was right
He bringeth darkness within the day Youre mad
Todd cried sharply
But punctuating his words came the furious earsplitting dinning of the bells clanging madly through the blackness
Why do they keep ringing them
Denton asked and answered his own question The earthquakes doing it the quakes ringing the bells
Something struck my cheek and putting up my hand felt the warm stickiness of blood
Plaster smashed somewhere
Still the earthquake shocks kept up
Denton shouted some thing which did not catch
Todd and cried simul taneously
Bells weve got to stop them
Theyre causing this darkness per haps the earthquake too
Its vibra tion cant you feel it
Something in the vibration of those bells is blanket ing the suns lightwaves
For lights vibration you know
If we can stop them It would be fools errand Todd cried
Youre talking nonsense Then stay here
can find my way will you come Ross
For second did not answer
All the monstrous references gleaned from our study of the lost bells were flood ing back into my mind the ancient god Zuchequon whom the Mutsunes were supposed to have the power of summoning by certain deeptoned sounds He corneth sometimes with in the eclipse All life passeth away at his coming Yet can He be called to earths surface before His time Im with you Denton said
Then damn it so am
Todd snapped
Ill see the end of this
If there is anything HE DID not finish but felt hands groping for mine
Ill lead Denton told us
Take it easy now
wondered how Denton could find his way in that enveloping shroud of jet blackness
Then remembered his uncanny memory and sense of direc tion
No homing pigeon could make straighter way to its destination than he
It was mad Odyssey through black hell of shrieking ruin
Flying objects screamed past us unseen walls and chimneys toppled and smashed nearby
Frightened hysterical men and women blundered into us in the dark and went shouting away vainly searching for escape from this stygian deathtrap
And it was cold cold
frigid and icy chill pervaded the air and ray fin gers and ears were already numbed and aching
The icy air sent knife edged pains slashing through my throat and lungs as breathed
heard Denton and Todd wheezing and gasping curses as they stumbled along beside me
How Denton ever found his way through that chaotic maelstrom shall never understand
Denton shouted
The Mis sion
Somehow we mounted the steps
How the Mission managed to stand through the grinding shocks do not know
What probably saved it was the curious regularity of the temblors the quakes were more of rhythmic slow swaying of the earth than the usual abrupt wrenching shocks
From nearby came low chanting incongruous in the madness around us
BELLS OF HORROR Gloria Patri Filio Spiiitui Sanc to
The Franciscans were praying
But what availed their prayers while in the tower the bells were sending out their blasphemous summons
Luckily we had often visited the mission and Den ton knew his way to the tower
On that incredible climb up the stairs to the bell tower shall not dwell although every moment we were in danger of being dashed down to instant death
But at last we won to the loft where the bells were shriek ing their thunder through the black ness almost in our ears
Denton re leased my hand and shouted something could not distinguish
There was an agony of pain in my head and my flesh ached with the cold
felt an over powering impulse to sink down into black oblivion and leave this hellish chaos
My eyes were hot burning aching
For moment thought had lifted my hands unconsciously to rub my eyes
Then felt two arms constrict about my neck and vicious thumbs dug cruelly into my eyesockets
shrieked with the blinding agony of it
battled desperately in the dark ness battling not only my unknown assailant but fighting back mad per verse impulse to allow him to gouge out my eyes
Within my brain voice seemed to whisper Why do you need eyes
Blackness is better light brings pain
Blackness is best
But fought fiercely silently roll ing across the swaying floor of the belltower smashing against the walls tearing those grinding thumbs away from my eyes only to feel them come fumbling back
And still within my brain that horrible urgent whisper grew stronger You need no eyes
Eternal blackness is best
was conscious of different note in the clamor of the bells
What was it
There were only two notes now one of the bells had been silenced
Somehowe the cold was not so oppres sive
And was grayish radiance be ginning to pervade the blackness
Certainly the temblors were less vio lent and as strained to break away Continued on page REV mm iQF El CI AUDELS HANDY BOOK OF ELECTRICITY nW Engineers Electricians Students and all inter ested in Electricity

St Louis Adtion the World Over in Stories That Take You to Svery Part of the Globe IN OUR COMPANION MAGAZINE THRILLING ADVENTURES AT ALL STANDS Continued from page from my shadowy opponent felt the racking shocks subside grow gentler die away altogether
The harsh clangor of the two bells stopped
My opponent suddenly shuddered and stiffened
rolled away sprang up in the grayness alert for re newal of the attack
It did not come
Very slowly very gradually the darkness lifted from San Xavier
Grayness first like pearly opales cent dawn then yellowish fingers of sunlight and finally the hot blaze of summer afternoon
From the bell tower could see the street below Where men and women stared up un believingly at the blue sky
At my feet was the clapper from one of the bells
Denton was swaying drunkenly his white face splotched with blood his clothing torn and smeared with dust
That did it he whispered
Only one combination of sounds could sum mon the Thing
When silenced one bell He was silent staring down
At our feet lay Todd his clothing dishevelled his face scratched and bleeding
As we watched he got weakly to his feet look of monstrous horror growing in his eyes
Involuntarily shrank back my hands going up protectingly
HE flinched Ross he whispered through white lips
My God oss couldnt help it
couldnt help it tell you
Something kept telling me to put out your eyes and Dentons too and then to gouge out my own
voice in my head And abruptly understood remem bering that horrible whisper within my brain while struggled with poor Todd
That malignant horror he whom the Book of Iod called Zusha kon and whom the Mutsunes knew as Zuchequon had sent his evil potent command into our brains command ing us to blind ourselves
And we had nearly obeyed that voiceless dreadful command
But all was well now
Or was it
had hoped to close the doors of my memory forever on the entire hor rible affair for it is best not to dwell too closely upon such things
And de spite the storm of adverse criticism BEST FUN FICTION AND FOTOS IN and curiosity that was aroused by the smashing of the bells the next day with the full permission of Father Bernard of the Mission had fully determined never to reveal the truth of the matter
It was my hope that only three men Denton Todd and myself might hold the key to the horror and that it would die with us
Yet something has occurred which forces me to break my silence and place before the world the facts of the case
Denton agrees with me that perhaps thus mystics and oc cultists who have knowledge of such things may be enabled to utilize their knowledge more effectually if what we fear ever comes to pass
Two months after the affair at San Xavier an eclipse of the sun occurred
At that time was at my home in Los Angeles Denton was at the headquar ters of the Historical Society in San Francisco and Arthur Todd was oc cupying his apartment in Hollywood
The eclipse began at pm and within few moments of the begin ning of the obscuration felt strange sensation creeping over me
dread fully familiar itching manifested it self in my eyes and began to rub them fiercely
Then remembering jerked down my hands and thrust them hastily into my pockets
But the burn ing sensation persisted
The telephone rang
Grateful for the distraction went to it hurriedly
It was Todd
He gave me no chance to speak
Ross its back
he cried into the transmitter
Ever since the eclipse began Ive been fighting
Its power was strongest over me you know
It wants me to help me Ross
cant keep Then silence
Wait hold on just for few moments
Ill be there
No answer
hesitated then hung up and raced out to my car
It was normal twentyminute drive to Todds apartment but covered it in seven with my lights glowing through the gloom of the eclipse and mad thoughts crawling horribly in my brain

McNTEII BACHELOR OF MTJBIC TF South Van Meu Los Angeles Calif Concluded from page at my side
Todds door was locked
After few fruitless shouts we burst it open
The electric lights were blaz ing
What cosmic abominations may be summoned to dreadful life by ageold spells and sounds is question dare not contemplate for have hor rible feeling that when the lost bells of San Xavier were rung an unearthly and terrible chain of consequences was set in motion and believe too that the summoning of those evil bells was more effective than we then real ized
Ancient evils when roused to life may not easily return to their brood ing sleep and have curious horror of what may happen at the next eclipse of the sun
Somehow the words of the hellish Book of lod keep recurring to me Yet can He be called to earths surface before His time He bring eth darkness All life all sound all movement passeth away at His com ing and worst of all that horribly significant phrase He cometh some times within the eclipse
Just what had happened in Todds apartment do not know
The tele phone receiver was dangling from the wall and gun was lying beside my friends prostrate form
But it was not the scarlet stain on the left breast of his dressinggown that riveted my horrorblasted stare it was the hol low empty eyesockets that glared up sightlessly from the contorted face that and the crimsonstained thumbs of Arthur Todd

THE BLACK ARTS Continued iiom page But there was no blood
The flesh was rancid like the body of dead man long buried
Later the corporal would have been courtmartialed for causing the death of the soldiers who had responded to his false signal were it not for the testimony of the private and also the sworn statements by Chinese merchants of the village that Zombies had long worked in the grain fields beyond the village
This Chinese gunner was Zombie He had been placed at this gun and ordered by the satanic will of his master to pull the trigger whenever soldiers appeared be fore him
Like an automaton he had re sponded until blown to bits removing what demonic power had been able to control his bloodless corpse
Bodies of dead men housing the magic of the devil
Who can tell
At least give the devil his due LUCIFER
LETTERS FROM READERS SPEAKING of the devil and his due we think it only fair to do the same for those disciples of Lucifer who have some diabolical or praiseworthy
comments to make about STRANGE STORIES
We cant possibly include the thousands who responded so nobly to our request for let ters but we can dip into the brew at ran dom and ladle out extracts from as many letters as we have room for
To all how ever who wrote in we are grateful as even devils can be and we invite you to continue your personal dissections of our attempts to present the uncanny and strange
Here goes then with our brew
cupful from RobL Madle Phila Pa was indeed pleased to note the appearance ol the first issue of STBANGE STOKIES
The cover picture does not typify the type of stories published
Please have real fantastic cover on the next issue many of your interior artists are quite capable of painting excellent covers
Thanks for the variety of artists theyre all good with Wesso and Paul doing the best work it would be good idea to have several drawings each issue by Virgil Finlay he is unsur passable when it comes to illustrating weird fic tion
The stories themselves were either good or fair with THE SORCERERS JEWEL by Tarleton Eiske and MAJOR McCRAItYS VISION by Ralph Farley the most outstanding
It might be good idea to print stories of pure fantasy in future issues and please subordinate the dead man ris ing from his grave to wreak vengeance on his killer etc
For his reason didnt care for Henry Kuttners THE FROG
Kuttner usually writes very excellent fantasy but he fell down this time
Wellmans CHANGELING was nice little piece of fantasy
Cant say Ive read anything similar to it before
On the whole the first issue of STRANGE STORIES was fairly good but there is plenty room for improvement

We dip into the cauldron now and come up with the following from Harold Feating of Quincy Mass
Please keep the standard of STRANGE STORIES up to its present level
Commenting on the stories in the first issue THE SINGING SHADOWS was superb although written by an author have never heard of before THE CURSE OF THE HOUSE another grand storv by longtime favor ite of mine Hubert Bloeh EYES OF THE HE IENT by two more ot my favorite authors Der leth and Schorer fairly good but not up to thefr usual high standard THE INVADERS excellent although Keith Hammond is also new name to me CHANGELING by Well man is perfect exam ple of weirdness THE SORCERERS JEWEL by Iiske another fine weird yarn and another new author
Good illustrators in issue Wesso Morey Paul Jwck Binder
THE BLACK ARTS is grand department written as convincingly as any fiction
Keep this department
hope too you will have some kind of club similar to the ScienceFiction League of THRILLING WONDER STORIES of which am member
And heres to your coining out more frequently
Yes were planning club and will tell you about it in the next issue
Down goes the ladle again and we come up with couple of short spoonsful
Reagan Pittsburgh Pa says Tour first issue of STRANGE STORIES hits the spot
The subject matter is varied to suit any taste
So keep up the pood work
Would like to see vampire story in the next Issues
good out right ghost story will not be overlooked either
And Gertrude Gordon of New York City congratulates and criticizes us with STRANGE STORIES is splendid and am devotee of fantastic fiction
If it keeps to its pres ent stature it will be in the lead of the several really good magazines dealing with the uncanny
But please not those kind of pictures on the eov through it one day and found to my delight it wasnt but the picture is so misleading
If yon have something definitely fantastic on the cover Im sure youve got something there
We hope so
Stirring the brew around again up pops Weaver Wright of Holly wood Calif am sorry to say found the first issue ol STRANGE STORIES too interesting to ignore
Yoo see get fantasy mags galore Including your compnmon magazines THRILLING WONDER STORIES and STARTLING STORIES
So had hoped my interests being primarily scientific fictional and my time all occupied that STRANGE STORIES would be too predominantly weird to warrant my actually reading it onlv filing It away to keep my collection complete
But If youre go ing to offer nifty featnre stories regular
Like THE SINGING SHADOWS an absorbinguncanny yarn
Farley yarn MAJOR McCRARYS VISION and Paulpictured INVADERS enjoyed next best
As for illustrations THE FROG and SERVANT OP SATAN by Marchioni and Sehomburg
Klines story however was grave deKIlne for its author or maybe it was ftosiwrltten
One complaint Poor cover no individuality
One big compliment The novacious motion of naT iug every story illustrated by different artist
And heres some liquid we bring to the surface tagged Ross Jobe of Jefferson City Mo
never thought would ever be in position to correct an editor and wouldnt let this chance THE BLACK ARTS pass by for lots of money because Ive taken bo many corrections from them
In THE BLACK ABTS department Lucifer states that King Saul Haw the ghost of Solomon
Tut tot According to the Bible he asked for and saw the wraith of Samuel
The February edition was beyond doubt fine one
And beyond doubt Reader Jobe is cor rect
Chalk up one lapsis mentis for Luci fer the devil has his weak moments
Now bubbling up from our cauldron comes Douglas Robinson from Garrett Hill Pa am interested in BLACK ARTS organization
think the magazine is the hest of its kind
Please send me information about ths items of King Saul and Salem
would like to get any kino of infor mation and stories of Black Arts
For King Saul we refer you to the first book of Samuel Chapter Verses
And for Salem witchcraft among others there are the following books Narratives of Witchcraft Cases by George Burr Scribners Sundry Documents of Witch craft in Mass by Geo
Chamberlain New England Historical Society and Witchcraft in Salem by John Fiske Houghton Mifflin Co
Our ladle dips up weighty bowlful from Mason of Toronto Ontario
Weve absorbed the criticisms and sugges tions as well as the praises and will give proper consideration to them but all we have room for now are few comments on the stories The stories are for the most part very good and rate as follows
THE CTCKSE OP THE HOUSE THE INVAD ERS and THE SORCERERS JEWEL
Tied for first place
If you produce three such stories as these per issue wont be doing much growling
Wellmana little gem THE CHANGELING would take second place
Parleys short htt me in somewhat the Bame way as Well mans nice and pleasing
Then come ETES OF Till HKK NT and THK FROG followed by THE SINGING SHADOWS very well written but not quite bizarre enough and finally SERVANT OF SATAN

THE BOSS DIDNT EVEN KNOW MY NAME He said he remembered seeing me around but he didnt even know my name until the wrote him that William Harris had enrolled for course of home study and was doing fine work
Whos William Harris
he asked
Then he looked me up
Told me he was glad to see was ambitious
Said hed keep his eye on me
He did too
Gave me my chance when Frank Jordan was sent out on the road
was promoted over older men who had been with the firm for years
My sparetime studying helped me to get that job and to keep it after got it It certainly was lucky day for me when signed that
One reason employers recognize the value of
training is that many of them are former students
They recognize that todays students are tomor rows leaders
In the years since these Schools were founded more than has been spent in preparing and revising texts
per sonal individual method of instruction has been developed
