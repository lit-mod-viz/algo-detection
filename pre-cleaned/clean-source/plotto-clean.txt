woman of mystery and male utility character FA MA father of and mother of SRA CH sister of and child NOTE mere reading of this list of characters in their various combinations is in it self highly suggestive to the trained imagination
Certain combinations will have their appeal and by their reference numbers may be immediately referred to in the various Conflict Groups
The use for which this list is designed however primarily covers the selection of terminal Conflicts
The Clauses of the Masterplots are numbered in parentheses and in the Classification by Character Symbols the terminal suggestions are all group ed with their corresponding numbers at the end of each subgroup of Conflicts
If the number of the desired terminal Conflict is not found in the subgroup other sub groups should be scanned for Conflict approximating the one desired and the situa tion altered to correspond with the needs of the moment
Or another terminal Clause may be almost synonomous with the one required and its number substituted
Very often in writing story knotty point will be reached where the ingenuity of the writer wavers or where he wishes to give the action different trend
study of the Classification by Symbols will be found rich in suggestions of means for meeting such an emergency
Such study may be best approached in this manner Resolve the leading characters of your storys situation into Plotto character symbols if possible not more than two or three symbols
Then look up the Cmbina tion of symbols in the foregoing index and follow the references to the Classification by Symbols and if necessary on into the Conflicts
If desired combinations of symbols cannot be found single symbol of the de sired combination may be changed into the Plotto utility symbol or or any other symbol which nearest approximates the one desired
Here as elsewhere in Plotto transposition change and manipulation will bring the utmost in results
