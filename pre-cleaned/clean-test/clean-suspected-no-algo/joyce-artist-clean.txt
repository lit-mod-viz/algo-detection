Portrait of the Artist as Young ManbyJames JoyceChapter IOnce upon time and very good time it was there was moocow comingdown along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the roadmet nicens little boy named baby tuckooHis father told him that story his father looked at him through aglass he had hairy face
He was baby tuckoo
The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrnelived she sold lemon platt
the wild rose blossoms On the little green place
He sang that song
That was his song
the green wothe botheth
When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold
His motherput on the oilsheet
That had the queer smell
His mother had nicer smell than his father
She played on the pianothe sailors hornpipe for him to dance
He danced Tralala lala Tralala tralaladdy Tralala lala Tralala lala
Uncle Charles and Dante clapped
They were older than his father andmother but uncle Charles was older than Dante
Dante had two brushes in her press
The brush with the maroon velvetback was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet backwas for Parnell
Dante gave him cachou every time he brought her apiece of tissue paper
The Vances lived in number seven
They had different father andmother
They were Eileens father and mother
When they were grown uphe was going to marry Eileen
He hid under the table
His mother saidO Stephen will apologise
Dante saidO if not the eagles will come and pull out his eyes Pull out his eyes Apologise Apologise Pull out his eyes
Apologise Pull out his eyes Pull out his eyes Apologise
The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys
All were shouting and theprefects urged them on with strong cries
The evening air was pale andchilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasyleather orb flew like heavy bird through the grey light
He kept onthe fringe of his line out of sight of his prefect out of the reachof the rude feet feigning to run now and then
He felt his body smalland weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak andwatery
Rody Kickham was not like that he would be captain of thethird line all the fellows said
Rody Kickham was decent fellow but Nasty Roche was stink
RodyKickham had greaves in his number and hamper in the refectory
NastyRoche had big hands
He called the Friday pudding dogintheblanket
And one day he had askedWhat is your name
Stephen had answered Stephen Dedalus
Then Nasty Roche had saidWhat kind of name is that
And when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had askedWhat is your father
Stephen had answeredA gentleman
Then Nasty Roche had askedIs he magistrate
He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line makinglittle runs now and then
But his hands were bluish with cold
He kepthis hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit
That was beltround his pocket
And belt was also to give fellow belt
One day afellow said to CantwellId give you such belt in second
Cantwell had answeredGo and fight your match
Give Cecil Thunder belt
Id like to seeyou
Hed give you toe in the rump for yourself
That was not nice expression
His mother had told him not to speakwith the rough boys in the college
Nice mother
The first day in thehall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veildouble to her nose to kiss him and her nose and eyes were red
But hehad pretended not to see that she was going to cry
She was nicemother but she was not so nice when she cried
And his father had givenhim two fiveshilling pieces for pocket money
And his father had toldhim if he wanted anything to write home to him and whatever he didnever to peach on fellow
Then at the door of the castle the rectorhad shaken hands with his father and mother his soutane fluttering inthe breeze and the car had driven off with his father and mother onit
They had cried to him from the car waving their handsGoodbye Stephen goodbye
Goodbye Stephen goodbye
He was caught in the whirl of scrimmage and fearful of the flashingeyes and muddy boots bent down to look through the legs
The fellowswere struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kickingand stamping
Then Jack Lawtons yellow boots dodged out the ball andall the other boots and legs ran after
He ran after them little wayand then stopped
It was useless to run on
Soon they would be goinghome for the holidays
After supper in the study hall he would changethe number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven to seventysix
It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold
The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle
Hewondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on thehaha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows
Oneday when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him themarks of the soldiers slugs in the wood of the door and had given hima piece of shortbread that the community ate
It was nice and warm tosee the lights in the castle
It was like something in book
PerhapsLeicester Abbey was like that
And there were nice sentences in DoctorCornwells Spelling Book
They were like poetry but they were onlysentences to learn the spelling from
Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey Where the abbots buried him
Canker is disease of plants Cancer one of animals
It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire leaning hishead upon his hands and think on those sentences
He shivered as if hehad cold slimy water next his skin
That was mean of Wells to shoulderhim into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuffboxfor Wellss seasoned hacking chestnut the conqueror of forty
How coldand slimy the water had been
fellow had once seen big rat jumpinto the scum
Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting forBrigid to bring in the tea
She had her feet on the fender and herjewelly slippers were so hot and they had such lovely warm smell
Dante knew lot of things
She had taught him where the MozambiqueChannel was and what was the longest river in America and what was thename of the highest mountain in the moon
Father Arnall knew more thanDante because he was priest but both his father and uncle Charlessaid that Dante was clever woman and wellread woman
And when Dantemade that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouththat was heartburn
voice cried far out on the playgroundAll in
Then other voices cried from the lower and third linesAll in
All in
The players closed around flushed and muddy and he went among themglad to go in
Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace
fellowasked him to give it one last but he walked on without even answeringthe fellow
Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect waslooking
The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and saidWe all know why you speak
You are McGlades suck
Suck was queer word
The fellow called Simon Moonan that name becauseSimon Moonan used to tie the prefects false sleeves behind his backand the prefect used to let on to be angry
But the sound was ugly
Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel andhis father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty waterwent down through the hole in the basin
And when it had all gone downslowly the hole in the basin had made sound like that suck
To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel coldand then hot
There were two cocks that you turned and water came outcold and hot
He felt cold and then little hot and he could see thenames printed on the cocks
That was very queer thing
And the air in the corridor chilled him too
It was queer and wettish
But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made light noise likea little song
Always the same and when the fellows stopped talking inthe playroom you could hear it
It was the hour for sums
Father Arnall wrote hard sum on the boardand then saidNow then who will win
Go ahead York
Go ahead Lancaster
Stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused
The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on thebreast of his jacket began to flutter
He was no good at sums but hetried his best so that York might not lose
Father Arnalls face lookedvery black but he was not in wax he was laughing
Then Jack Lawtoncracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and saidRight
Bravo Lancaster
The red rose wins
Come on now York
Jack Lawton looked over from his side
The little silk badge with thered rose on it looked very rich because he had blue sailor top on
Stephen felt his own face red too thinking of all the bets about whowould get first place in elements Jack Lawton or he
Some weeks JackLawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first
His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the nextsum and heard Father Arnalls voice
Then all his eagerness passed awayand he felt his face quite cool
He thought his face must be whitebecause it felt so cool
He could not get out the answer for the sumbut it did not matter
White roses and red roses those were beautifulcolours to think of
And the cards for first place and second place andthird place were beautiful colours too pink and cream and lavender
Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of
Perhaps awild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song aboutthe wild rose blossoms on the little green place
But you could nothave green rose
But perhaps somewhere in the world you could
The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms andalong the corridors towards the refectory
He sat looking at the twoprints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread
Thetablecloth was damp and limp
But he drank off the hot weak tea whichthe clumsy scullion girt with white apron poured into his cup
Hewondered whether the scullions apron was damp too or whether all whitethings were cold and damp
Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa thattheir people sent them in tins
They said they could not drink the teathat it was hogwash
Their fathers were magistrates the fellows said
All the boys seemed to him very strange
They had all fathers andmothers and different clothes and voices
He longed to be at home andlay his head on his mothers lap
But he could not and so he longedfor the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed
He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming saidWhats up
Have you pain or whats up with you
dont know Stephen said
Sick in your breadbasket Fleming said because your face looks white
It will go away
yes Stephen said
But he was not sick there
He thought that he was sick in his heart ifyou could be sick in that place
Fleming was very decent to ask him
Hewanted to cry
He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and openedthe flaps of his ears
Then he heard the noise of the refectory everytime he opened the flaps of his ears
It made roar like train atnight
And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like traingoing into tunnel
That night at Dalkey the train had roared likethat and then when it went into the tunnel the roar stopped
Heclosed his eyes and the train went on roaring and then stoppingroaring again stopping
It was nice to hear it roar and stop and thenroar out of the tunnel again and then stop
Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting inthe middle of the refectory Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and theSpaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese whowore the woolly cap
And then the lower line tables and the tables ofthe third line
And every single fellow had different way of walking
He sat in corner of the playroom pretending to watch game ofdominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the littlesong of the gas
The prefect was at the door with some boys and SimonMoonan was knotting his false sleeves
He was telling them somethingabout Tullabeg
Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen andsaidTell us Dedalus do you kiss your mother before you go to bed
Stephen answeredI do
Wells turned to the other fellows and saidO say heres fellow says he kisses his mother every night beforehe goes to bed
The other fellows stopped their game and turned round laughing
Stephen blushed under their eyes and saidI do not
Wells saidO say heres fellow says he doesnt kiss his mother before hegoes to bed
They all laughed again
Stephen tried to laugh with them
He felt hiswhole body hot and confused in moment
What was the right answer tothe question
He had given two and still Wells laughed
But Wells mustknow the right answer for he was in third of grammar
He tried to thinkof Wellss mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wellssface
He did not like Wellss face
It was Wells who had shouldered himinto the square ditch the day before because he would not swop hislittle snuffbox for Wellss seasoned hacking chestnut the conqueror offorty
It was mean thing to do all the fellows said it was
And howcold and slimy the water had been
And fellow had once seen big ratjump plop into the scum
The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body and when the bellrang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms he felt thecold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes
He stilltried to think what was the right answer
Was it right to kiss hismother or wrong to kiss his mother
What did that mean to kiss
Youput your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put herface down
That was to kiss
His mother put her lips on his cheek herlips were soft and they wetted his cheek and they made tiny littlenoise kiss
Why did people do that with their two faces
Sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed thenumber pasted up inside from seventyseven to seventysix
But theChristmas vacation was very far away but one time it would comebecause the earth moved round always
There was picture of the earth on the first page of his geography abig ball in the middle of clouds
Fleming had box of crayons and onenight during free study he had coloured the earth green and the cloudsmaroon
That was like the two brushes in Dantes press the brush withthe green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvetback for Michael Davitt
But he had not told Fleming to colour themthose colours
Fleming had done it himself
He opened the geography to study the lesson but he could not learn thenames of places in America
Still they were all different places thathad different names
They were all in different countries and thecountries were in continents and the continents were in the world andthe world was in the universe
He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had writtenthere himself his name and where he was
Stephen Dedalus Class of Elements Clongowes Wood College Sallins County Kildare Ireland Europe The World The UniverseThat was in his writing and Fleming one night for cod had written onthe opposite page Stephen Dedalus is my name Ireland is my nation
Clongowes is my dwellingplace And heaven my expectation
He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry
Then heread the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his ownname
That was he and he read down the page again
What was after theuniverse
But was there anything round the universe to showwhere it stopped before the nothing place began
It could not be wallbut there could be thin thin line there all round everything
It wasvery big to think about everything and everywhere
Only God could dothat
He tried to think what big thought that must be but he couldonly think of God
God was Gods name just as his name was Stephen
Dieu was the French for God and that was Gods name too and whenanyone prayed to God and said Dieu then God knew at once that it was aFrench person that was praying
But though there were different namesfor God in all the different languages in the world and God understoodwhat all the people who prayed said in their different languages stillGod remained always the same God and Gods real name was God
It made him very tired to think that way
It made him feel his headvery big
He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the greenround earth in the middle of the maroon clouds
He wondered which wasright to be for the green or for the maroon because Dante had rippedthe green velvet back off the brush that was for Parnell one day withher scissors and had told him that Parnell was bad man
He wonderedif they were arguing at home about that
That was called politics
There were two sides in it Dante was on one side and his father and MrCasey were on the other side but his mother and uncle Charles were onno side
Every day there was something in the paper about it
It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that hedid not know where the universe ended
He felt small and weak
Whenwould he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric
They had bigvoices and big boots and they studied trigonometry
That was very faraway
First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacationagain and then again another term and then again the vacation
It waslike train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise ofthe boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flapsof the ears
Term vacation tunnel out noise stop
How far away itwas
It was better to go to bed to sleep
Only prayers in the chapeland then bed
He shivered and yawned
It would be lovely in bed afterthe sheets got bit hot
First they were so cold to get into
Heshivered to think how cold they were first
But then they got hot andthen he could sleep
It was lovely to be tired
He yawned again
Nightprayers and then bed he shivered and wanted to yawn
It would belovely in few minutes
He felt warm glow creeping up from the coldshivering sheets warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over ever sowarm and yet he shivered little and still wanted to yawn
The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hallafter the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to thechapel
The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit
Soon all would be dark and sleeping
There was cold night air in thechapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night
The seawas cold day and night but it was colder at night
It was cold anddark under the seawall beside his fathers house
But the kettle wouldbe on the hob to make punch
The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew theresponses Lord open our lips And our mouths shall announce Thy praise
Incline unto our aid God
Lord make haste to help us
There was cold night smell in the chapel
But it was holy smell
Itwas not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of thechapel at Sunday mass
That was smell of air and rain and turf andcorduroy
But they were very holy peasants
They breathed behind him onhis neck and sighed as they prayed
They lived in Clane fellow saidthere were little cottages there and he had seen woman standing atthe halfdoor of cottage with child in her arms as the cars hadcome past from Sallins
It would be lovely to sleep for one night inthat cottage before the fire of smoking turf in the dark lit by thefire in the warm dark breathing the smell of the peasants air andrain and turf and corduroy
But the road there between the treeswas dark
You would be lost in the dark
It made him afraid to think ofhow it was
He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayer
He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees
Visit we beseech Thee Lord this habitation and drive away from it all the snares of the enemy
May Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ our Lord
His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory
He toldhis fingers to hurry up
He had to undress and then kneel and say hisown prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he mightnot go to hell when he died
He rolled his stockings off and put on hisnightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated hisprayers quickly fearing that the gas would go down
He felt hisshoulders shaking as he murmured God bless my father and my mother and spare them to me
God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me
God bless Dante and uncle Charles and spare them to me
He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and tucking the end ofthe nightshirt under his feet curled himself together under the coldwhite sheets shaking and trembling
But he would not go to hell whenhe died and the shaking would stop
voice bade the boys in thedormitory goodnight
He peered out for an instant over the coverlet andsaw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off onall sides
The light was lowered quietly
The prefects shoes went away
Down the staircase and along thecorridors or to his room at the end
He saw the dark
Was it true aboutthe black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big ascarriagelamps
They said it was the ghost of murderer
long shiverof fear flowed over his body
He saw the dark entrance hall of thecastle
Old servants in old dress were in the ironingroom above thestaircase
It was long ago
The old servants were quiet
There was afire there but the hall was still dark
figure came up the staircasefrom the hall
He wore the white cloak of marshal his face was paleand strange he held his hand pressed to his side
He looked out ofstrange eyes at the old servants
They looked at him and saw theirmasters face and cloak and knew that he had received his deathwound
But only the dark was where they looked only dark silent air
Theirmaster had received his deathwound on the battlefield of Prague faraway over the sea
He was standing on the field his hand was pressedto his side his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloakof marshal
how cold and strange it was to think of that
All the dark was coldand strange
There were pale strange faces there great eyes likecarriagelamps
They were the ghosts of murderers the figures ofmarshals who had received their deathwound on battlefields far awayover the sea
What did they wish to say that their faces were sostrange
Visit we beseech Thee Lord this habitation and drive away from itall
Going home for the holidays
That would be lovely the fellows had toldhim
Getting up on the cars in the early wintry morning outside thedoor of the castle
The cars were rolling on the gravel
Cheers for therector
The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised
They drovemerrily along the country roads
The drivers pointed with their whipsto Bodenstown
The fellows cheered
They passed the farmhouse of theJolly Farmer
Cheer after cheer after cheer
Through Clane they drovecheering and cheered
The peasant women stood at the halfdoors the menstood here and there
The lovely smell there was in the wintry air thesmell of Clane rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and corduroy
The train was full of fellows long long chocolate train with creamfacings
The guards went to and fro opening closing lockingunlocking the doors
They were men in dark blue and silver they hadsilvery whistles and their keys made quick music click clickclick click
And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the Hill of Allen
The telegraph poles were passing passing
The train went on and on
There were lanterns in the hall of his fathers house and ropesof green branches
There were holly and ivy round the pierglass andholly and ivy green and red twined round the chandeliers
There werered holly and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls
Holly andivy for him and for Christmas
LovelyAll the people
Welcome home Stephen
Noises of welcome
His motherkissed him
Was that right
His father was marshal now higher than amagistrate
Welcome home Stephen
There was noise of curtainrings running back along the rods of waterbeing splashed in the basins
There was noise of rising and dressingand washing in the dormitory noise of clapping of hands as theprefect went up and down telling the fellows to look sharp
palesunlight showed the yellow curtains drawn back the tossed beds
Hisbed was very hot and his face and body were very hot
He got up and sat on the side of his bed
He was weak
He tried to pullon his stocking
It had horrid rough feel
The sunlight was queer andcold
Fleming saidAre you not well
He did not know and Fleming saidGet back into bed
Ill tell McGlade youre not well
Hes sick
Who is
Tell McGlade
Get back into bed
Is he sick
fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking clinging to hisfoot and climbed back into the hot bed
He crouched down between the sheets glad of their tepid glow
He heardthe fellows talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass
It was mean thing to do to shoulder him into the square ditch theywere saying
Then their voices ceased they had gone
voice at his bed saidDedalus dont spy on us sure you wont
Wellss face was there
He looked at it and saw that Wells was afraid
didnt mean to
Sure you wont
His father had told him whatever he did never to peach on fellow
He shook his head and answered no and felt glad
Wells saidI didnt mean to honour bright
It was only for cod
Im sorry
The face and the voice went away
Sorry because he was afraid
Afraidthat it was some disease
Canker was disease of plants and cancer oneof animals or another different
That was long time ago then out onthe playgrounds in the evening light creeping from point to point onthe fringe of his line heavy bird flying low through the grey light
Leicester Abbey lit up
Wolsey died there
The abbots buried himthemselves
It was not Wellss face it was the prefects
He was not foxing
Nono he was sick really
He was not foxing
And he felt the prefectshand on his forehead and he felt his forehead warm and damp againstthe prefects cold damp hand
That was the way rat felt slimy anddamp and cold
Every rat had two eyes to look out of
Sleek slimycoats little little feet tucked up to jump black slimy eyes to lookout of
They could understand how to jump
But the minds of rats couldnot understand trigonometry
When they were dead they lay on theirsides
Their coats dried then
They were only dead things
The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying thathe was to get up that Father Minister had said he was to get up anddress and go to the infirmary
And while he was dressing himself asquickly as he could the prefect saidWe must pack off to Brother Michael because we have the collywobbles
He was very decent to say that
That was all to make him laugh
But hecould not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery and thenthe prefect had to laugh by himself
The prefect criedQuick march
They went together down the staircase and along the corridor and pastthe bath
As he passed the door he remembered with vague fear thewarm turfcoloured bogwater the warm moist air the noise of plungesthe smell of the towels like medicine
Brother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from thedoor of the dark cabinet on his right came smell like medicine
Thatcame from the bottles on the shelves
The prefect spoke to BrotherMichael and Brother Michael answered and called the prefect sir
He hadreddish hair mixed with grey and queer look
It was queer that hewould always be brother
It was queer too that you could not call himsir because he was brother and had different kind of look
Was henot holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others
There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was fellow andwhen they went in he called outHello
Its young Dedalus
Whats up
The sky is up Brother Michael said
He was fellow out of the third of grammar and while Stephen wasundressing he asked Brother Michael to bring him round of butteredtoast
Ah do
he said
Butter you up
said Brother Michael
Youll get your walking papers inthe morning when the doctor comes
the fellow said
Im not well yet
Brother Michael repeatedYoull get your walking papers
tell you
He bent down to rake the fire
He had long back like the long back ofa tramhorse
He shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at thefellow out of third of grammar
Then Brother Michael went away and after while the fellow out ofthird of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep
That was the infirmary
He was sick then
Had they written home to tellhis mother and father
But it would be quicker for one of the prieststo go himself to tell them
Or he would write letter for the priestto bring
Dear Mother am sick
want to go home
Please come and take me home
am in the infirmary
Your fond son StephenHow far away they were
There was cold sunlight outside the window
Hewondered if he would die
You could die just the same on sunny day
He might die before his mother came
Then he would have dead mass inthe chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little haddied
All the fellows would be at the mass dressed in black all withsad faces
Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him
The rector would be there in cope of black and gold and there wouldbe tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque
And theywould carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buriedin the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes
And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done
And the bell wouldtoll slowly
He could hear the tolling
He said over to himself the song that Brigidhad taught him
The castle bell
Farewell my mother
Bury me in the old churchyard Beside my eldest brother
My coffin shall be black Six angels at my back Two to sing and two to pray And two to carry my soul away
How beautiful and sad that was
How beautiful the words were where theysaid Bury me in the old churchyard tremor passed over his body
How sad and how beautiful
He wanted to cry quietly but not forhimself for the words so beautiful and sad like music
The bell
The cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at hisbedside with bowl of beeftea
He was glad for his mouth was hot anddry
He could hear them playing in the playgrounds
And the day wasgoing on in the college just as if he were there
Then Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of the third ofgrammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news inthe paper
He told Stephen that his name was Athy and that his fatherkept lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his fatherwould give good tip to Brother Michael any time he wanted it becauseBrother Michael was very decent and always told him the news out of thepaper they got every day up in the castle
There was every kind of newsin the paper accidents shipwrecks sports and politics
Now it is all about politics in the papers he said
Do your peopletalk about that too
Yes Stephen said
Mine too he said
Then he thought for moment and saidYou have queer name Dedalus and have queer name too Athy
Myname is the name of town
Your name is like Latin
Then he askedAre you good at riddles
Stephen answeredNot very good
Then he saidCan you answer me this one
Why is the county of Kildare like the legof fellows breeches
Stephen thought what could be the answer and then saidI give it up
Because there is thigh in it he said
Do you see the joke
Athy isthe town in the county Kildare and thigh is the other thigh
Oh see Stephen said
Thats an old riddle he said
After moment he saidI say
asked Stephen
You know he said you can ask that riddle another way
Can you
said Stephen
The same riddle he said
Do you know the other way to ask it
No said Stephen
Can you not think of the other way
he said
He looked at Stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke
Then he lay backon the pillow and saidThere is another way but wont tell you what it is
Why did he not tell it
His father who kept the racehorses must be amagistrate too like Saurins father and Nasty Roches father
Hethought of his own father of how he sang songs while his mother playedand of how he always gave him shilling when he asked for sixpence andhe felt sorry for him that he was not magistrate like the other boysfathers
Then why was he sent to that place with them
But his fatherhad told him that he would be no stranger there because his grandunclehad presented an address to the Liberator there fifty years before
Youcould know the people of that time by their old dress
It seemed to hima solemn time and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows inClongowes wore blue coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats andcaps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grownup people and keptgreyhounds of their own to course the hares with
He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker
There would be cloudy grey light over the playgrounds
There was nonoise on the playgrounds
The class must be doing the themes or perhapsFather Arnall was reading out of the book
It was queer that they had not given him any medicine
Perhaps BrotherMichael would bring it back when he came
They said you got stinkingstuff to drink when you were in the infirmary
But he felt better nowthan before
It would be nice getting better slowly
You could get abook then
There was book in the library about Holland
There werelovely foreign names in it and pictures of strangelooking cities andships
It made you feel so happy
How pale the light was at the window
But that was nice
The fire roseand fell on the wall
It was like waves
Someone had put coal on and heheard voices
They were talking
It was the noise of the waves
Or thewaves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell
He saw the sea of waves long dark waves rising and falling dark underthe moonless night
tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where theship was entering and he saw multitude of people gathered by thewaters edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour
tallman stood on the deck looking out towards the flat dark land and bythe light at the pierhead he saw his face the sorrowful face ofBrother Michael
He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in loudvoice of sorrow over the watersHe is dead
We saw him lying upon the catafalque
wail of sorrowwent up from the people
He is dead
They fell upon their knees moaning in sorrow
And he saw Dante in maroon velvet dress and with green velvetmantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and silently past thepeople who knelt by the waters edge
great fire banked high and red flamed in the grate and under theivytwined branches of the chandelier the Christmas table was spread
They had come home little late and still dinner was not ready but itwould be ready in jiffy his mother had said
They were waiting forthe door to open and for the servants to come in holding the bigdishes covered with their heavy metal covers
All were waiting uncle Charles who sat far away in the shadow of thewindow Dante and Mr Casey who sat in the easychairs at either side ofthe hearth Stephen seated on chair between them his feet restingon the toasted boss
Mr Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglassabove the mantelpiece waxed out his moustache ends and then partinghis coat tails stood with his back to the glowing fire and still fromtime to time he withdrew hand from his coat tail to wax out one ofhis moustache ends
Mr Casey leaned his head to one side and smilingtapped the gland of his neck with his fingers
And Stephen smiled toofor he knew now that it was not true that Mr Casey had purse ofsilver in his throat
He smiled to think how the silvery noise which MrCasey used to make had deceived him
And when he had tried to open MrCaseys hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seenthat the fingers could not be straightened out and Mr Casey had toldhim that he had got those three cramped fingers making birthdaypresent for Queen Victoria
Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck andsmiled at Stephen with sleepy eyes and Mr Dedalus said to himYes
Well now thats all right
we had good walk hadnt weJohn
wonder if theres any likelihood of dinner this evening
Yes well now we got good breath of ozone round the Head today
Ay bedad
He turned to Dante and saidYou didnt stir out at all Mrs Riordan
Dante frowned and said shortlyNo
Mr Dedalus dropped his coat tails and went over to the sideboard
Hebrought forth great stone jar of whisky from the locker and filledthe decanter slowly bending now and then to see how much he had pouredin
Then replacing the jar in the locker he poured little of thewhisky into two glasses added little water and came back with themto the fireplace
thimbleful John he said just to whet your appetite
Mr Casey took the glass drank and placed it near him on themantelpiece
Then he saidWell cant help thinking of our friend Christopher manufacturing
He broke into fit of laughter and coughing and addedmanufacturing that champagne for those fellows
Mr Dedalus laughed loudly
Is it Christy
he said
Theres more cunning in one of those warts onhis bald head than in pack of jack foxes
He inclined his head closed his eyes and licking his lips profuselybegan to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper
And he has such soft mouth when hes speaking to you dont youknow
Hes very moist and watery about the dewlaps God bless him
Mr Casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and laughter
Stephen seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through his fathers faceand voice laughed
Mr Dedalus put up his eyeglass and staring down at him said quietlyand kindlyWhat are you laughing at you little puppy you
The servants entered and placed the dishes on the table
Mrs Dedalusfollowed and the places were arranged
Sit over she said
Mr Dedalus went to the end of the table and saidNow Mrs Riordan sit over
John sit you down my hearty
He looked round to where uncle Charles sat and saidNow then sir theres bird here waiting for you
When all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover and thensaid quickly withdrawing itNow Stephen
Stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before mealsBless us Lord and these Thy gifts which through Thy bounty we areabout to receive through Christ our Lord
AmenAll blessed themselves and Mr Dedalus with sigh of pleasure liftedfrom the dish the heavy cover pearled around the edge with glisteningdrops
Stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain trussed andskewered on the kitchen table
He knew that his father had paid aguinea for it in Dunns of DOlier Street and that the man had proddedit often at the breastbone to show how good it was and he rememberedthe mans voice when he had saidTake that one sir
Thats the real Ally Daly
Why did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat turkey
ButClongowes was far away and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham andcelery rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was bankedhigh and red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feelso happy and when dinner was ended the big plum pudding would becarried in studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly withbluish fire running around it and little green flag flying from thetop
It was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little brothersand sisters who were waiting in the nursery as he had often waitedtill the pudding came
The deep low collar and the Eton jacket made himfeel queer and oldish and that morning when his mother had brought himdown to the parlour dressed for mass his father had cried
That wasbecause he was thinking of his own father
And uncle Charles had saidso too
Mr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily
Then he saidPoor old Christy hes nearly lopsided now with roguery
Simon said Mrs Dedalus you havent given Mrs Riordan any sauce
Mr Dedalus seized the sauceboat
he cried
Mrs Riordan pity the poor blind
Dante covered her plate with her hands and saidNo thanks
Mr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles
How are you off sir
Right as the mail Simon
You John
Im all right
Go on yourself
Here Stephen heres something to make your hair curl
He poured sauce freely over Stephens plate and set the boat again onthe table
Then he asked uncle Charles was it tender
Uncle Charlescould not speak because his mouth was full but he nodded that it was
That was good answer our friend made to the canon
said MrDedalus
didnt think he had that much in him said Mr Casey
Ill pay your dues father when you cease turning the house of Godinto pollingboothA nice answer said Dante for any man calling himself catholic togive to his priest
They have only themselves to blame said Mr Dedalus suavely
If theytook fools advice they would confine their attention to religion
It is religion Dante said
They are doing their duty in warning thepeople
We go to the house of God Mr Casey said in all humility to pray toour Maker and not to hear election addresses
It is religion Dante said again
They are right
They must directtheir flocks
And preach politics from the altar is it
asked Mr Dedalus
Certainly said Dante
It is question of public morality
priestwould not be priest if he did not tell his flock what is right andwhat is wrong
Mrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork sayingFor pity sake and for pity sake let us have no political discussion onthis day of all days in the year
Quite right maam said uncle Charles
Now Simon thats quite enoughnow
Not another word now
Yes yes said Mr Dedalus quickly
He uncovered the dish boldly and saidNow then whos for more turkey
Nobody answered
Dante saidNice language for any catholic to use
Mrs Riordan appeal to you said Mrs Dedalus to let the matter dropnow
Dante turned on her and saidAnd am to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church beingflouted
Nobody is saying word against them said Mr Dedalus so long as theydont meddle in politics
The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken said Dante and theymust be obeyed
Let them leave politics alone said Mr Casey or the people may leavetheir church alone
You hear
said Dante turning to Mrs Dedalus
Mr Casey
said Mrs Dedalus let it end now
Too bad
Too bad
said uncle Charles
cried Mr Dedalus
Were we to desert him at the bidding of theEnglish people
He was no longer worthy to lead said Dante
He was public sinner
We are all sinners and black sinners said Mr Casey coldly
Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh
said Mrs Riordan
Itwould be better for him that millstone were tied about his neck andthat he were cast into the depths of the sea rather than that he shouldscandalise one of these my least little ones That is the language ofthe Holy Ghost
And very bad language if you ask me said Mr Dedalus coolly
said uncle Charles
The boy
Yes yes said Mr Dedalus
meant about the
was thinking aboutthe bad language of the railway porter
Well now thats all right
Here Stephen show me your plate old chap
Eat away now
He heaped up the food on Stephens plate and served uncle Charles andMr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of sauce
Mrs Dedaluswas eating little and Dante sat with her hands in her lap
She was redin the face
Mr Dedalus rooted with the carvers at the end of the dishand saidTheres tasty bit here we call the popes nose
If any lady orgentleman
He held piece of fowl up on the prong of the carvingfork
He put it on his own plate sayingWell you cant say but you were asked
think had better eat itmyself because Im not well in my health lately
He winked at Stephen and replacing the dishcover began to eat again
There was silence while he ate
Then he saidWell now the day kept up fine after all
There were plenty ofstrangers down too
Nobody spoke
He said againI think there were more strangers down than last Christmas
He looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards theirplates and receiving no reply waited for moment and said bitterlyWell my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow
There could be neither luck nor grace Dante said in house wherethere is no respect for the pastors of the church
Mr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate
he said
Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub of gutsup in Armagh
Princes of the church said Mr Casey with slow scorn
Lord Leitrims coachman yes said Mr Dedalus
They are the Lords anointed Dante said
They are an honour to theircountry
Tub of guts said Mr Dedalus coarsely
He has handsome face mindyou in repose
You should see that fellow lapping up his bacon andcabbage of cold winters day
He twisted his features into grimace of heavy bestiality and made alapping noise with his lips
Really Simon you should not speak that way before Stephen
Its notright
hell remember all this when he grows up said Dante hotlythelanguage he heard against God and religion and priests in his own home
Let him remember too cried Mr Casey to her from across the table thelanguage with which the priests and the priests pawns broke Parnellsheart and hounded him into his grave
Let him remember that too when hegrows up
Sons of bitches
cried Mr Dedalus
When he was down they turned on himto betray him and rend him like rats in sewer
Lowlived dogs
Andthey look it
By Christ they look it
They behaved rightly cried Dante
They obeyed their bishops and theirpriests
Honour to them
Well it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day in theyear said Mrs Dedalus can we be free from these dreadful disputes
Uncle Charles raised his hands mildly and saidCome now come now come now
Can we not have our opinions whateverthey are without this bad temper and this bad language
It is too badsurely
Mrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in low voice but Dante said loudlyI will not say nothing
will defend my church and my religion whenit is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics
Mr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the table andresting his elbows before him said in hoarse voice to his hostTell me did tell you that story about very famous spit
You did not John said Mr Dedalus
Why then said Mr Casey it is most instructive story
It happenednot long ago in the county Wicklow where we are now
He broke off and turning towards Dante said with quiet indignationAnd may tell you maam that if you mean me am no renegadecatholic
am catholic as my father was and his father before himand his father before him again when we gave up our lives rather thansell our faith
The more shame to you now Dante said to speak as you do
The story John said Mr Dedalus smiling
Let us have the storyanyhow
Catholic indeed
repeated Dante ironically
The blackest protestant inthe land would not speak the language have heard this evening
Mr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro crooning like countrysinger
am no protestant tell you again said Mr Casey flushing
Mr Dedalus still crooning and swaying his head began to sing in agrunting nasal tone come all you Roman catholics That never went to mass
He took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set to eatingsaying to Mr CaseyLet us have the story John
It will help us to digest
Stephen looked with affection at Mr Caseys face which stared acrossthe table over his joined hands
He liked to sit near him at the firelooking up at his dark fierce face
But his dark eyes were never fierceand his slow voice was good to listen to
But why was he then againstthe priests
Because Dante must be right then
But he had heard hisfather say that she was spoiled nun and that she had come out of theconvent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from thesavages for the trinkets and the chainies
Perhaps that made her severeagainst Parnell
And she did not like him to play with Eileen becauseEileen was protestant and when she was young she knew children thatused to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun ofthe litany of the Blessed Virgin
Tower of Ivory they used to sayHouse of Gold How could woman be tower of ivory or house ofgold
Who was right then
And he remembered the evening in theinfirmary in Clongowes the dark waters the light at the pierhead andthe moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard
Eileen had long white hands
One evening when playing tig she had puther hands over his eyes long and white and thin and cold and soft
That was ivory cold white thing
That was the meaning of Tower ofIvory
The story is very short and sweet Mr Casey said
It was one day downin Arklow cold bitter day not long before the chief died
May Godhave mercy on him
He closed his eyes wearily and paused
Mr Dedalus took bone from hisplate and tore some meat from it with his teeth sayingBefore he was killed you mean
Mr Casey opened his eyes sighed and went onIt was down in Arklow one day
We were down there at meeting andafter the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railwaystation through the crowd
Such booing and baaing man you neverheard
They called us all the names in the world
Well there was oneold lady and drunken old harridan she was surely that paid all herattention to me
She kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawlingand screaming into my face Priesthunter
The Paris Funds
Mr Fox
Kitty OSheaAnd what did you do John
asked Mr Dedalus
let her bawl away said Mr Casey
It was cold day and to keep upmy heart had saving your presence maam quid of Tullamore in mymouth and sure couldnt say word in any case because my mouth wasfull of tobacco juice
Well John
let her bawl away to her hearts content Kitty OShea andthe rest of it till at last she called that lady name that wontsully this Christmas board nor your ears maam nor my own lips byrepeating
He paused
Mr Dedalus lifting his head from the bone askedAnd what did you do John
said Mr Casey
She stuck her ugly old face up at me when she saidit and had my mouth full of tobacco juice
bent down to her andPhth says to her like that
He turned aside and made the act of spitting
Phth says to her like that right into her eye
He clapped his hand to his eye and gave hoarse scream of pain
Jesus Mary and Joseph says she
Im blinded
Im blinded anddrowndedHe stopped in fit of coughing and laughter repeatingIm blinded entirely
Mr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while uncle Charlesswayed his head to and fro
Dante looked terribly angry and repeated while they laughedVery nice
Very nice
It was not nice about the spit in the womans eye
But what was the name the woman had called Kitty OShea that Mr Caseywould not repeat
He thought of Mr Casey walking through the crowds ofpeople and making speeches from wagonette
That was what he had beenin prison for and he remembered that one night Sergeant ONeill hadcome to the house and had stood in the hall talking in low voicewith his father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap
Andthat night Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but car had cometo the door and he had heard his father say something about theCabinteely road
He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father and so was Dantetoo for one night at the band on the esplanade she had hit gentlemanon the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when theband played God save the Queen at the end
Mr Dedalus gave snort of contempt
Ah John he said
It is true for them
We are an unfortunatepriestridden race and always were and always will be till the end ofthe chapter
Uncle Charles shook his head sayingA bad business
bad business
Mr Dedalus repeatedA priestridden Godforsaken race
He pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to his right
Do you see that old chap up there John
he said
He was goodIrishman when there was no money in the job
He was condemned to deathas whiteboy
But he had saying about our clerical friends that hewould never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany
Dante broke in angrilyIf we are priestridden race we ought to be proud of it
They are theapple of Gods eye
Touch them not says Christ for they are theapple of My eyeAnd can we not love our country then
asked Mr Casey
Are we not tofollow the man that was born to lead us
traitor to his country
replied Dante
traitor an adulterer
Thepriests were right to abandon him
The priests were always the truefriends of Ireland
Were they faith
said Mr Casey
He threw his fist on the table and frowning angrily protruded onefinger after another
Didnt the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the union whenBishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to the MarquessCornwallis
Didnt the bishops and priests sell the aspirations oftheir country in in return for catholic emancipation
Didnt theydenounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box
And didnt they dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus
His face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow rise to hisown cheek as the spoken words thrilled him
Mr Dedalus uttered guffawof coarse scorn
by God he cried forgot little old Paul Cullen
Another apple ofGods eye
Dante bent across the table and cried to Mr CaseyRight
They were always right
God and morality and religioncome first
Mrs Dedalus seeing her excitement said to herMrs Riordan dont excite yourself answering them
God and religion before everything
Dante cried
God and religionbefore the world
Mr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on the table witha crash
Very well then he shouted hoarsely if it comes to that no God forIreland
cried Mr Dedalus seizing his guest by the coat sleeve
Dante stared across the table her cheeks shaking
Mr Casey struggledup from his chair and bent across the table towards her scraping theair from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing asidea cobweb
No God for Ireland
he cried
We have had too much God in Ireland
Away with God
screamed Dante starting to her feet and almostspitting in his face
Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into his chair againtalking to him from both sides reasonably
He stared before him out ofhis dark flaming eyes repeatingAway with God say
Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table upsettingher napkinring which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to restagainst the foot of an easychair
Mrs Dedalus rose quickly and followedher towards the door
At the door Dante turned round violently andshouted down the room her cheeks flushed and quivering with rageDevil out of hell
We won
We crushed him to death
The door slammed behind her
Mr Casey freeing his arms from his holders suddenly bowed his head onhis hands with sob of pain
Poor Parnell
he cried loudly
My dead king
He sobbed loudly and bitterly
Stephen raising his terrorstricken face saw that his fathers eyeswere full of tears
The fellows talked together in little groups
One fellow saidThey were caught near the Hill of Lyons
Who caught them
Mr Gleeson and the minister
They were on car
The same fellow addedA fellow in the higher line told me
Fleming askedBut why did they run away tell us
know why Cecil Thunder said
Because they had fecked cash out ofthe rectors room
Who fecked it
Kickhams brother
And they all went shares in it
But that was stealing
How could they have done that
fat lot you know about it Thunder
Wells said
know why theyscut
Tell us why
was told not to Wells said
go on Wells all said
You might tell us
We wont let it out
Stephen bent forward his head to hear
Wells looked round to see ifanyone was coming
Then he said secretlyYou know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy
Well they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell
And thats why they ran away if you want to know
And the fellow who had spoken first saidYes thats what heard too from the fellow in the higher line
The fellows all were silent
Stephen stood among them afraid to speaklistening
faint sickness of awe made him feel weak
How could theyhave done that
He thought of the dark silent sacristy
There were darkwooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded
Itwas not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath
It wasa holy place
He remembered the summer evening he had been there to bedressed as boatbearer the evening of the procession to the littlealtar in the wood
strange and holy place
The boy that held thecenser had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the silverycap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting
That wascalled charcoal and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung itgently and had given off weak sour smell
And then when all werevested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rectorhad put spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals
The fellows were talking together in little groups here and there onthe playground
The fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller thatwas because sprinter had knocked him down the day before fellowout of second of grammar
He had been thrown by the fellows machinelightly on the cinderpath and his spectacles had been broken in threepieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth
That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and thegoalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up
But therewas no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming and somesaid that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers
Andall over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowlingtwisters and lobs
And from here and from there came the sounds of thecricket bats through the soft grey air
They said pick pack pockpuck little drops of water in fountain slowly falling in thebrimming bowl
Athy who had been silent said quietlyYou are all wrong
All turned towards him eagerly
Do you know
Who told you
Tell us Athy
Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan was walking byhimself kicking stone before him
Ask him he said
The fellows looked there and then saidWhy him
Is he in it
Athy lowered his voice and saidDo you know why those fellows scut
will tell you but you must notlet on you know
Tell us Athy
Go on
You might if you know
He paused for moment and then said mysteriouslyThey were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square onenight
The fellows looked at him and askedCaught
What doing
Athy saidSmugging
All the fellows were silent and Athy saidAnd thats why
Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all lookingacross the playground
He wanted to ask somebody about it
What didthat mean about the smugging in the square
Why did the five fellowsout of the higher line run away for that
It was joke he thought
Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him ball ofcreamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled downto him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was atthe door
It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers andthe ball was made just like red and green apple only it opened and itwas full of the creamy sweets
And one day Boyle had said that anelephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he wascalled Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because hewas always at his nails paring them
Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was girl
Theywere like ivory only soft
That was the meaning of Tower of Ivorybut protestants could not understand it and made fun of it
One day hehad stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds
waiter wasrunning up trail of bunting on the flagstaff and fox terrier wasscampering to and fro on the sunny lawn
She had put her hand into hispocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and softher hand was
She had said that pockets were funny things to have andthen all of sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down thesloping curve of the path
Her fair hair had streamed out behind herlike gold in the sun
Tower of Ivory
House of Gold By thinking ofthings you could understand them
But why in the square
You went there when you wanted to do something
It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tinypinholes and there was queer smell of stale water there
And behindthe door of one of the closets there was drawing in red pencil of abearded man in Roman dress with brick in each hand and underneathwas the name of the drawingBalbus was building wallSome fellow had drawn it there for cod
It had funny face but itwas very like man with beard
And on the wall of another closetthere was written in backhand in beautiful writingJulius Cæsar wrote The Calico BellyPerhaps that was why they were there because it was place where somefellows wrote things for cod
But all the same it was queer what Athysaid and the way he said it
It was not cod because they had runaway
He looked with the others across the playground and began to feelafraid
At last Fleming saidAnd we are all to be punished for what other fellows did
wont come back see if do Cecil Thunder said
Three dayssilence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight everyminute
Yes said Wells
And old Barrett has new way of twisting the note sothat you cant open it and fold it again to see how many ferulæ you areto get
wont come back too
Yes said Cecil Thunder and the prefect of studies was in second ofgrammar this morning
Let us get up rebellion Fleming said
Will we
All the fellows were silent
The air was very silent and you could hearthe cricket bats but more slowly than before pick pock
Wells askedWhat is going to be done to them
Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged Athy said and thefellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or beingexpelled
And which are they taking
asked the fellow who had spoken first
All are taking expulsion except Corrigan Athy answered
Hes going tobe flogged by Mr Gleeson
know why Cecil Thunder said
He is right and the other fellows arewrong because flogging wears off after bit but fellow that hasbeen expelled from college is known all his life on account of it
Besides Gleeson wont flog him hard
Its best of his play not to Fleming said
wouldnt like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker Cecil Thunder said
ButI dont believe they will be flogged
Perhaps they will be sent up fortwice nine
No no said Athy
Theyll both get it on the vital spot
Wells rubbed himself and said in crying voicePlease sir let me off
Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket saying It cant be helped It must be done
So down with your breeches And out with your bum
The fellows laughed but he felt that they were little afraid
In thesilence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here andfrom there pock
That was sound to hear but if you were hit then youwould feel pain
The pandybat made sound too but not like that
Thefellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside andhe wondered what was the pain like
There were different kinds ofsounds
long thin cane would have high whistling sound and hewondered what was that pain like
It made him shivery to think of itand cold and what Athy said too
But what was there to laugh at in it
It made him shivery but that was because you always felt like shiverwhen you let down your trousers
It was the same in the bath when youundressed yourself
He wondered who had to let them down the master orthe boy himself
how could they laugh about it that way
He looked at Athys rolledup sleeves and knuckly inky hands
He hadrolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves
But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattishwhite hands and the nails of them were long and pointed
Perhaps hepared them too like Lady Boyle
But they were terribly long and pointednails
So long and cruel they were though the white fattish hands werenot cruel but gentle
And though he trembled with cold and fright tothink of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of thecane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when youundressed yourself yet he felt feeling of queer quiet pleasure insidehim to think of the white fattish hands clean and strong and gentle
And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said that Mr Gleeson wouldnot flog Corrigan hard
And Fleming had said he would not because itwas best of his play not to
But that was not why
voice from far out on the playground criedAll in
And other voices criedAll in
All in
During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded listening to theslow scraping of the pens
Mr Harford went to and fro making littlesigns in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show himhow to hold his pen
He had tried to spell out the headline for himselfthough he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book
Zeal without prudence is like ship adrift But the lines of theletters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing hisright eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make outthe full curves of the capital
But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into wax
All the othermasters got into dreadful waxes
But why were they to suffer for whatfellows in the higher line did
Wells had said that they had drunk someof the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had beenfound out who had done it by the smell
Perhaps they had stolen amonstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere
That must have beena terrible sin to go in there quietly at night to open the dark pressand steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altarin the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incensewent up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer andDominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir
But God wasnot in it of course when they stole it
But still it was strange anda great sin even to touch it
He thought of it with deep awe aterrible and strange sin it thrilled him to think of it in the silencewhen the pens scraped lightly
But to drink the altar wine out of thepress and be found out by the smell was sin too but it was notterrible and strange
It only made you feel little sickish on accountof the smell of the wine
Because on the day when he had made his firstholy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouthand put out his tongue little and when the rector had stooped downto give him the holy communion he had smelt faint winy smell off therectors breath after the wine of the mass
The word was beautifulwine
It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were darkpurple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples
But thefaint smell of the rectors breath had made him feel sick feeling onthe morning of his first communion
The day of your first communion wasthe happiest day of your life
And once lot of generals had askedNapoleon what was the happiest day of his life
They thought he wouldsay the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor
But he saidGentlemen the happiest day of my life was the day on which made myfirst holy communion
Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he remained stillleaning on the desk with his arms folded
Father Arnall gave out thethemebooks and he said that they were scandalous and that they were allto be written out again with the corrections at once
But the worst ofall was Flemings theme because the pages were stuck together by ablot and Father Arnall held it up by corner and said it was aninsult to any master to send him up such theme
Then he asked JackLawton to decline the noun mare and Jack Lawton stopped at theablative singular and could not go on with the plural
You should be ashamed of yourself said Father Arnall sternly
Youthe leader of the class
Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next
Nobody knew
Father Arnall became very quiet more and more quiet as each boy triedto answer it and could not
But his face was blacklooking and his eyeswere staring though his voice was so quiet
Then he asked Fleming andFleming said that the word had no plural
Father Arnall suddenly shutthe book and shouted at himKneel out there in the middle of the class
You are one of the idlestboys ever met
Copy out your themes again the rest of you
Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two lastbenches
The other boys bent over their themebooks and began to write
silence filled the classroom and Stephen glancing timidly at FatherArnalls dark face saw that it was little red from the wax he wasin
Was that sin for Father Arnall to be in wax or was he allowed toget into wax when the boys were idle because that made them studybetter or was he only letting on to be in wax
It was because he wasallowed because priest would know what sin was and would not do it
But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go toconfession
Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister
And ifthe minister did it he would go to the rector and the rector to theprovincial and the provincial to the general of the jesuits
That wascalled the order and he had heard his father say that they were allclever men
They could all have become highup people in the world ifthey had not become jesuits
And he wondered what Father Arnall andPaddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleesonwould have become if they had not become jesuits
It was hard to thinkwhat because you would have to think of them in different way withdifferent coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustachesand different kinds of hats
The door opened quietly and closed
quick whisper ran through theclass the prefect of studies
There was an instant of dead silence andthen the loud crack of pandybat on the last desk
Stephens heartleapt up in fear
Any boys want flogging here Father Arnall
cried the prefect ofstudies
Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class
He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his knees
he cried
Who is this boy
Why is he on his knees
What is yourname boy
Fleming sir
Hoho Fleming
An idler of course
can see it in your eye
Why is heon his knees Father Arnall
He wrote bad Latin theme Father Arnall said and he missed all thequestions in grammar
Of course he did
cried the prefect of studies of course he did
Aborn idler
can see it in the corner of his eye
He banged his pandybat down on the desk and criedUp Fleming
Up my boy
Fleming stood up slowly
Hold out
cried the prefect of studies
Fleming held out his hand
The pandybat came down on it with loudsmacking sound one two three four five six
Other hand
The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks
Kneel down
cried the prefect of studies
Fleming knelt down squeezing his hands under his armpits his facecontorted with pain but Stephen knew how hard his hands were becauseFleming was always rubbing rosin into them
But perhaps he was in greatpain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible
Stephens heart wasbeating and fluttering
At your work all of you
shouted the prefect of studies
We want nolazy idle loafers here lazy idle little schemers
At your work tellyou
Father Dolan will be in to see you every day
Father Dolan will bein tomorrow
He poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat sayingYou boy
When will Father Dolan be in again
Tomorrow sir said Tom Furlongs voice
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow said the prefect of studies
Makeup your minds for that
Every day Father Dolan
Write away
You boywho are you
Stephens heart jumped suddenly
Dedalus sir
Why are you not writing like the others
He could not speak with fright
Why is he not writing Father Arnall
He broke his glasses said Father Arnall and exempted him fromwork
What is this hear
What is this
Your name is
said theprefect of studies
Dedalus sir
Out here Dedalus
Lazy little schemer
see schemer in your face
Where did you break your glasses
Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class blinded by fear andhaste
Where did you break your glasses
repeated the prefect of studies
The cinderpath sir
The cinderpath
cried the prefect of studies
know that trick
Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for moment Father Dolanswhitegrey not young face his baldy whitegrey head with fluff at thesides of it the steel rims of his spectacles and his nocoloured eyeslooking through the glasses
Why did he say he knew that trick
Lazy idle little loafer
cried the prefect of studies
Broke myglasses
An old schoolboy trick
Out with your hand this moment
Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand withthe palm upwards
He felt the prefect of studies touch it for momentat the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of thesoutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike
hot burning stingingtingling blow like the loud crack of broken stick made his tremblinghand crumple together like leaf in the fire and at the sound and thepain scalding tears were driven into his eyes
His whole body wasshaking with fright his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning lividhand shook like loose leaf in the air
cry sprang to his lips aprayer to be let off
But though the tears scalded his eyes and hislimbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and thecry that scalded his throat
Other hand
shouted the prefect of studies
Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out hisleft hand
The soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was liftedand loud crashing sound and fierce maddening tingling burning painmade his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in lividquivering mass
The scalding water burst forth from his eyes andburning with shame and agony and fear he drew back his shaking arm interror and burst out into whine of pain
His body shook with palsyof fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from histhroat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down hisflaming cheeks
Kneel down cried the prefect of studies
Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides
Tothink of them beaten and swollen with pain all in moment made himfeel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone elsesthat he felt sorry for
And as he knelt calming the last sobs in histhroat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides hethought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms upand of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadiedthe shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm andfingers that shook helplessly in the air
Get at your work all of you cried the prefect of studies from thedoor
Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any boy any lazyidle little loafer wants flogging
Every day
Every day
The door closed behind him
The hushed class continued to copy out the themes
Father Arnall rosefrom his seat and went among them helping the boys with gentle wordsand telling them the mistakes they had made
His voice was very gentleand soft
Then he returned to his seat and said to Fleming and StephenYou may return to your places you two
Fleming and Stephen rose and walking to their seats sat down
Stephen scarlet with shame opened book quickly with one weak handand bent down upon it his face close to the page
It was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to readwithout glasses and he had written home to his father that morning tosend him new pair
And Father Arnall had said that he need not studytill the new glasses came
Then to be called schemer before the classand to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second andwas the leader of the Yorkists
How could the prefect of studies knowthat it was trick
He felt the touch of the prefects fingers as theyhad steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shakehands with him because the fingers were soft and firm but then in aninstant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash
Itwas cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class thenand Father Arnall had told them both that they might return to theirplaces without making any difference between them
He listened toFather Arnalls low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes
Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent
But it was unfair andcruel
The prefect of studies was priest but that was cruel andunfair
And his whitegrey face and the nocoloured eyes behind thesteel rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied thehand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better andlouder
Its stinking mean thing thats what it is said Fleming in thecorridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refectory topandy fellow for what is not his fault
You really broke your glasses by accident didnt you
Nasty Rocheasked
Stephen felt his heart filled by Flemings words and did not answer
Of course he did
said Fleming
wouldnt stand it
Id go up andtell the rector on him
Yes said Cecil Thunder eagerly and saw him lift the pandybat overhis shoulder and hes not allowed to do that
Did they hurt you much
Nasty Roche asked
Very much Stephen said
wouldnt stand it Fleming repeated from Baldyhead or any otherBaldyhead
Its stinking mean low trick thats what it is
Id gostraight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner
Yes do
Yes do said Cecil Thunder
Yes do
Yes go up and tell the rector on him Dedalus said NastyRoche because he said that hed come in tomorrow again and pandy you
Yes yes
Tell the rector all said
And there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and oneof them saidThe senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had been wronglypunished
It was wrong it was unfair and cruel and as he sat in the refectoryhe suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until hebegan to wonder whether it might not really be that there was somethingin his face which made him look like schemer and he wished he had alittle mirror to see
But there could not be and it was unjust andcruel and unfair
He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on Wednesdays inLent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it
Yes hewould do what the fellows had told him
He would go up and tell therector that he had been wrongly punished
thing like that had beendone before by somebody in history by some great person whose head wasin the books of history
And the rector would declare that he had beenwrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people alwaysdeclared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished
Thosewere the great men whose names were in Richmal Magnalls Questions
History was all about those men and what they did and that was whatPeter Parleys Tales about Greece and Rome were all about
Peter Parleyhimself was on the first page in picture
There was road over aheath with grass at the side and little bushes and Peter Parley had abroad hat like protestant minister and big stick and he was walkingfast along the road to Greece and Rome
It was easy what he had to do
All he had to do was when the dinner wasover and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to thecorridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle
Hehad nothing to do but that to turn to the right and walk fast up thestaircase and in half minute he would be in the low dark narrowcorridor that led through the castle to the rectors room
And everyfellow had said that it was unfair even the fellow out of second ofgrammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people
What would happen
He heard the fellows of the higher line stand up atthe top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down thematting Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard and the Portugueseand the fifth was big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by MrGleeson
That was why the prefect of studies had called him schemerand pandied him for nothing and straining his weak eyes tired withthe tears he watched big Corrigans broad shoulders and big hangingblack head passing in the file
But he had done something and besidesMr Gleeson would not flog him hard and he remembered how big Corriganlooked in the bath
He had skin the same colour as the turfcolouredbogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along theside his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step histhighs shook little because he was fat
The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out infile
He could go up the staircase because there was never priest ora prefect outside the refectory door
But he could not go
The rectorwould side with the prefect of studies and think it was schoolboytrick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the sameonly it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at anyfellow going up to the rector about him
The fellows had told him to gobut they would not go themselves
They had forgotten all about it
Noit was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studieshad only said he would come in
No it was best to hide out of the waybecause when you were small and young you could often escape that way
The fellows at his table stood up
He stood up and passed out amongthem in the file
He had to decide
He was coming near the door
If hewent on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because hecould not leave the playground for that
And if he went and was pandiedall the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about youngDedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies
He was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him
It was impossible he could not
He thought of the baldy head of theprefect of studies with the cruel nocoloured eyes looking at him andhe heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what hisname was
Why could he not remember the name when he was told the firsttime
Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out ofthe name
The great men in the history had names like that and nobodymade fun of them
It was his own name that he should have made fun ofif he wanted to make fun
Dolan it was like the name of woman whowashed clothes
He had reached the door and turning quickly up to the right walked upthe stairs and before he could make up his mind to come back he hadentered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle
And as hecrossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw withoutturning his head to look that all the fellows were looking after himas they went filing by
He passed along the narrow dark corridor passing little doors thatwere the doors of the rooms of the community
He peered in front of himand right and left through the gloom and thought that those must beportraits
It was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired withtears so that he could not see
But he thought they were the portraitsof the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on himsilently as he passed saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book andpointing to the words Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam in it saint FrancisXavier pointing to his chest Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on hishead like one of the prefects of the lines the three patrons of holyyouth saint Stanislaus Kostka saint Aloysius Gonzago and Blessed JohnBerchmans all with young faces because they died when they were youngand Father Peter Kenny sitting in chair wrapped in big cloak
He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked abouthim
That was where Hamilton Rowan had passed and the marks of thesoldiers slugs were there
And it was there that the old servants hadseen the ghost in the white cloak of marshal
An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing
He asked himwhere was the rectors room and the old servant pointed to the door atthe far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked
There was no answer
He knocked again more loudly and his heart jumpedwhen he heard muffled voice sayCome in
He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle ofthe green baize door inside
He found it and pushed it open and wentin
He saw the rector sitting at desk writing
There was skull on thedesk and strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather ofchairs
His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in andthe silence of the room and he looked at the skull and at the rectorskindlooking face
Well my little man said the rector what is it
Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and saidI broke my glasses sir
The rector opened his mouth and saidO
Then he smiled and saidWell if we broke our glasses we must write home for new pair
wrote home sir said Stephen and Father Arnall said am not tostudy till they come
Quite right
said the rector
Stephen swallowed down the thing again and tried to keep his legs andhis voice from shaking
But sirYes
Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because was not writing mytheme
The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood risingto his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes
The rector saidYour name is Dedalus isnt it
Yes sir
And where did you break your glasses
On the cinderpath sir
fellow was coming out of the bicycle houseand fell and they got broken
dont know the fellows name
The rector looked at him again in silence
Then he smiled and saidO well it was mistake am sure Father Dolan did not know
But told him broke them sir and he pandied me
Did you tell him that you had written home for new pair
the rectorasked
No sir
well then said the rector Father Dolan did not understand
You cansay that excuse you from your lessons for few days
Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent himYes sir but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy meagain for it
Very well the rector said it is mistake and shall speak toFather Dolan myself
Will that do now
Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmuredO yes sir thanks
The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skullwas and Stephen placing his hand in it for moment felt cool moistpalm
Good day now said the rector withdrawing his hand and bowing
Good day sir said Stephen
He bowed and walked quietly out of the room closing the doorscarefully and slowly
But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again inthe low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster
Fasterand faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly
He bumped hiselbow against the door at the end and hurrying down the staircasewalked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air
He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds
He brokeinto run and running quicker and quicker ran across the cinderpathand reached the third line playground panting
The fellows had seen him running
They closed round him in ringpushing one against another to hear
Tell us
Tell us
What did he say
Did you go in
What did he say
Tell us
Tell us
He told them what he had said and what the rector had said and when hehad told them all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into theair and criedHurroo
They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning skyhigh andcried againHurroo
They made cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among themand carried him along till he struggled to get free
And when he hadescaped from them they broke away in all directions flinging theircaps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up andcryingHurroo
And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three cheers forConmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever inClongowes
The cheers died away in the soft grey air
He was alone
He was happyand free but he would not be anyway proud with Father Dolan
He wouldbe very quiet and obedient and he wished that he could do somethingkind for him to show him that he was not proud
The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming
There wasthe smell of evening in the air the smell of the fields in the countrywhere they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they wentout for walk to Major Bartons the smell there was in the littlewood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were
The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slowtwisters
In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of the ballsand from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of thecricket bats pick pack pock puck like drops of water in fountainfalling softly in the brimming bowl
Chapter IIUncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his nephew suggestedto him to enjoy his morning smoke in little outhouse at the end ofthe garden
Very good Simon
All serene Simon said the old man tranquilly
Anywhere you like
The outhouse will do me nicely it will be moresalubrious
Damn me said Mr Dedalus frankly if know how you can smoke suchvillainous awful tobacco
Its like gunpowder by God
Its very nice Simon replied the old man
Very cool and mollifying
Every morning therefore uncle Charles repaired to his outhouse butnot before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair andbrushed and put on his tall hat
While he smoked the brim of his tallhat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of theouthouse door
His arbour as he called the reeking outhouse which heshared with the cat and the garden tools served him also as asoundingbox and every morning he hummed contentedly one of hisfavourite songs twine me bower or Blue eyes and golden hairor The Groves of Blarney while the grey and blue coils of smoke roseslowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air
During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles wasStephens constant companion
Uncle Charles was hale old man with awell tanned skin rugged features and white side whiskers
On week dayshe did messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shopsin the main street of the town with which the family dealt
Stephen wasglad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped him veryliberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrelsoutside the counter
He would seize handful of grapes and sawdust orthree or four American apples and thrust them generously into hisgrandnephews hand while the shopman smiled uneasily and on Stephensfeigning reluctance to take them he would frown and sayTake them sir
Do you hear me sir
Theyre good for your bowels
When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the parkwhere an old friend of Stephens father Mike Flynn would be foundseated on bench waiting for them
Then would begin Stephens runround the park
Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railwaystation watch in hand while Stephen ran round the track in the styleMike Flynn favoured his head high lifted his knees well lifted andhis hands held straight down by his sides
When the morning practicewas over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustratethem by shuffling along for yard or so comically in an old pair ofblue canvas shoes
small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaidswould gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles hadsat down again and were talking athletics and politics
Though he hadheard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runnersof modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at histrainers flabby stubblecovered face as it bent over the long stainedfingers through which he rolled his cigarette and with pity at themild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the taskand gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingersceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back intothe pouch
On the way home uncle Charles would often pay visit to the chapeland as the font was above Stephens reach the old man would dip hishand and then sprinkle the water briskly about Stephens clothes and onthe floor of the porch
While he prayed he knelt on his redhandkerchief and read above his breath from thumb blackenedprayerbook wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page
Stephen knelt at his side respecting though he did not share hispiety
He often wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously
Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of ahappy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back part ofthe big fortune he had squandered in Cork
On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took theirconstitutional
The old man was nimble walker in spite of his cornsand often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered
The littlevillage of Stillorgan was the parting of the ways
Either they went tothe left towards the Dublin mountains or along the Goatstown road andthence into Dundrum coming home by Sandyford
Trudging along the roador standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spokeconstantly of the subjects nearer their hearts of Irish politics ofMunster and of the legends of their own family to all of which Stephenlent an avid ear
Words which he did not understand he said over andover to himself till he had learnt them by heart and through them hehad glimpses of the real world about them
The hour when he too wouldtake part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secrethe began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him thenature of which he only dimly apprehended
His evenings were his own and he pored over ragged translation ofThe Count of Monte Cristo
The figure of that dark avenger stoodforth in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood ofthe strange and terrible
At night he built up on the parlour table animage of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowersand coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper inwhich chocolate is wrapped
When he had broken up this scenery wearyof its tinsel there would come to his mind the bright picture ofMarseilles of sunny trellises and of Mercedes
Outside Blackrock on the road that led to the mountains stood smallwhitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes and inthis house he told himself another Mercedes lived
Both on theoutward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by thislandmark and in his imagination he lived through long train ofadventures marvellous as those in the book itself towards the closeof which there appeared an image of himself grown older and sadderstanding in moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years beforeslighted his love and with sadly proud gesture of refusal sayingMadam never eat muscatel grapes
He became the ally of boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him agang of adventurers in the avenue
Aubrey carried whistle danglingfrom his buttonhole and bicycle lamp attached to his belt while theothers had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs
Stephen whohad read of Napoleons plain style of dress chose to remain unadornedand thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel withhis lieutenant before giving orders
The gang made forays into thegardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought battle onthe shaggy weedgrown rocks coming home after it weary stragglers withthe stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oilsof the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair
Aubrey and Stephen had common milkman and often they drove out in themilkcar to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass
While the menwere milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mareround the field
But when autumn came the cows were driven home fromthe grass and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook withits foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming brantroughs sickened Stephens heart
The cattle which had seemed sobeautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could noteven look at the milk they yielded
The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not tobe sent back to Clongowes
The practice in the park came to an end whenMike Flynn went into hospital
Aubrey was at school and had only anhour or two free in the evening
The gang fell asunder and there wereno more nightly forays or battles on the rocks
Stephen sometimes wentround with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chillydrives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt norepugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkmans coat
Whenever the car drew up before house he waited to catch glimpse ofa well scrubbed kitchen or of softly lighted hall and to see how theservant would hold the jug and how she would close the door
He thoughtit should be pleasant life enough driving along the roads everyevening to deliver milk if he had warm gloves and fat bag ofgingernuts in his pocket to eat from
But the same foreknowledge whichhad sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced roundthe park the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust athis trainers flabby stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over hislong stained fingers dissipated any vision of the future
In vagueway he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was thereason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes
For sometime he had felt the slight change in his house and those changes inwhat he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to hisboyish conception of the world
The ambition which he felt astir attimes in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet
dusk like that ofthe outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mares hoofsclattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great canswaying and rattling behind him
He returned to Mercedes and as he brooded upon her image strangeunrest crept into his blood
Sometimes fever gathered within him andled him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue
The peaceof the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured tenderinfluence into his restless heart
The noise of children at playannoyed him and their silly voices made him feel even more keenly thanhe had felt at Clongowes that he was different from others
He did notwant to play
He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantialimage which his soul so constantly beheld
He did not know where toseek it or how but premonition which led him on told him that thisimage would without any overt act of his encounter him
They wouldmeet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their trystperhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place
They would bealone surrounded by darkness and silence and in that moment ofsupreme tenderness he would be transfigured
He would fade intosomething impalpable under her eyes and then in moment he would betransfigured
Weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall fromhim in that magic moment
Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door andmen had come tramping into the house to dismantle it
The furniture hadbeen hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wispsof straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate
When all hadbeen safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue andfrom the window of the railway carriage in which he had sat with hisredeyed mother Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion Road
The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested thepoker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame
Uncle Charlesdozed in corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near himthe family portraits leaned against the wall
The lamp on the tableshed weak light over the boarded floor muddied by the feet of thevanmen
Stephen sat on footstool beside his father listening to along and incoherent monologue
He understood little or nothing of it atfirst but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and thatsome fight was going to take place
He felt too that he was beingenlisted for the fight that some duty was being laid upon hisshoulders
The sudden flight from the comfort and reverie of Blackrockthe passage through the gloomy foggy city the thought of the barecheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavyand again an intuition foreknowledge of the future came to him
Heunderstood also why the servants had often whispered together in thehall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his backto the fire talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit downand eat his dinner
Theres crack of the whip left in me yet Stephen old chap said MrDedalus poking at the dull fire with fierce energy
Were not deadyet sonny
No by the Lord Jesus God forgive me nor half dead
Dublin was new and complex sensation
Uncle Charles had grown sowitless that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorderin settling in the new house left Stephen freer than he had been inBlackrock
In the beginning he contented himself with circling timidlyround the neighbouring square or at most going half way down one ofthe side streets but when he had made skeleton map of the city in hismind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached theCustom House
He passed unchallenged among the docks and along thequays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay bobbing on thesurface of the water in thick yellow scum at the crowds of quayporters and the rumbling carts and the illdressed bearded policeman
The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the balesof merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holdsof steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent himwandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of Mercedes
And amid this new bustling life he might have fancied himself inanother Marseilles but that he missed the bright sky and the sunwarmedtrellises of the wineshops
vague dissatisfaction grew up within himas he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skiesand yet he continued to wander up and down day after day as if hereally sought someone that eluded him
He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives andthough they passed jovial array of shops lit up and adorned forChristmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him
The causesof his embitterment were many remote and near
He was angry withhimself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulsesangry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the worldabout him into vision of squalor and insincerity
Yet his anger lentnothing to the vision
He chronicled with patience what he sawdetaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret
He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunts kitchen
lamp witha reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its lighthis aunt was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees
Shelooked long time at smiling picture that was set in it and saidmusinglyThe beautiful Mabel Hunter
ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and saidsoftlyWhat is she in mud
In pantomime love
The child leaned her ringletted head against her mothers sleevegazing on the picture and murmured as if fascinatedThe beautiful Mabel Hunter
As if fascinated her eyes rested long upon those demurely tauntingeyes and she murmured devotedlyIsnt she an exquisite creature
And the boy who came in from the street stamping crookedly under hisstone of coal heard her words
He dropped his load promptly on thefloor and hurried to her side to see
He mauled the edges of the paperwith his reddened and blackened hands shouldering her aside andcomplaining that he could not see
He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the olddarkwindowed house
The firelight flickered on the wall and beyond thewindow spectral dusk was gathering upon the river
Before the fire anold woman was busy making tea and as she bustled at the task she toldin low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said
She told tooof certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways andsayings
He sat listening to the words and following the ways ofadventure that lay open in the coals arches and vaults and windinggalleries and jagged caverns
Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway
skull appearedsuspended in the gloom of the doorway
feeble creature like monkeywas there drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire
whiningvoice came from the door askingIs that Josephine
The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplaceNo Ellen its Stephen
good evening Stephen
He answered the greeting and saw silly smile break over the face inthe doorway
Do you want anything Ellen
asked the old woman at the fire
But she did not answer the question and saidI thought it was Josephine
thought you were Josephine Stephen
And repeating this several times she fell to laughing feebly
He was sitting in the midst of childrens party at Harolds Cross
His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little partin the games
The children wearing the spoils of their crackersdanced and romped noisily and though he tried to share theirmerriment he felt himself gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hats andsunbonnets
But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into snug corner of theroom he began to taste the joy of his loneliness
The mirth which inthe beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial waslike soothing air to him passing gaily by his senses hiding fromother eyes the feverish agitation of his blood while through thecircling of the dancers and amid the music and laughter her glancetravelled to his corner flattering taunting searching exciting hisheart
In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on theirthings the party was over
She had thrown shawl about her and asthey went together towards the tram sprays of her fresh warm breathflew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on theglassy road
It was the last tram
The lank brown horses knew it and shook theirbells to the clear night in admonition
The conductor talked with thedriver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp
On the emptyseats of the tram were scattered few coloured tickets
No sound offootsteps came up or down the road
No sound broke the peace of thenight save when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together andshook their bells
They seemed to listen he on the upper step and she on the lower
Shecame up to his step many times and went down to hers again betweentheir phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some momentson the upper step forgetting to go down and then went down
His heartdanced upon her movements like cork upon tide
He heard what hereyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dimpast whether in life or reverie he had heard their tale before
Hesaw her urge her vanities her fine dress and sash and long blackstockings and knew that he had yielded to them thousand times
Yet avoice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart asking himwould he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand
And he remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking into thehotel grounds watching the waiters running up trail of bunting onthe flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunnylawn and how all of sudden she had broken out into peal oflaughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path
Now as thenhe stood listlessly in his place seemingly tranquil watcher of thescene before him
She too wants me to catch hold of her he thought
Thats why she camewith me to the tram
could easily catch hold of her when she comes upto my step nobody is looking
could hold her and kiss her
But he did neither and when he was sitting alone in the desertedtram he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at thecorrugated footboard
The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours
Before him lay new pen new bottle of ink and new emeraldexercise
From force of habit he had written at the top of the firstpage the initial letters of the jesuit motto AMDG
On the firstline of the page appeared the title of the verses he was trying towrite To
He knew it was right to begin so for he had seensimilar titles in the collected poems of Lord Byron
When he hadwritten this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell intoa daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book
He sawhimself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the discussionat the Christmas dinner table trying to write poem about Parnell onthe back of one of his fathers second moiety notices
But his brainhad then refused to grapple with the theme and desisting he hadcovered the page with the names and addresses of certain of hisclassmates Roderick Kickham John Lawton Anthony MacSwiney Simon MoonanNow it seemed as if he would fail again but by dint of brooding on theincident he thought himself into confidence
During this process allthose elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of thescene
There remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the trammennor of the horses nor did he and she appear vividly
The verses toldonly of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of themoon
Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of theprotagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees andwhen the moment of farewell had come the kiss which had been withheldby one was given by both
After this the letters were writtenat the foot of the page and having hidden the book he went into hismothers bedroom and gazed at his face for long time in the mirror ofher dressingtable
But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end
Oneevening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busyall through dinner
Stephen had been awaiting his fathers return forthere had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father wouldmake him dip his bread in the gravy
But he did not relish the hash forthe mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with scum of disgust
walked bang into him said Mr Dedalus for the fourth time just atthe corner of the square
Then suppose said Mrs Dedalus he will be able to arrange it
Imean about Belvedere
Of course he will said Mr Dedalus
Dont tell you hes provincialof the order now
never liked the idea of sending him to the christian brothersmyself said Mrs Dedalus
Christian brothers be damned
said Mr Dedalus
Is it with Paddy Stinkand Micky Mud
No let him stick to the jesuits in Gods name since hebegan with them
Theyll be of service to him in after years
Those arethe fellows that can get you position
And theyre very rich order arent they Simon
They live well tell you
You saw their table at Clongowes
Fed up by God like gamecocks
Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him finish whatwas on it
Now then Stephen he said you must put your shoulder to the wheelold chap
Youve had fine long holiday
Im sure hell work very hard now said Mrs Dedalus especiallywhen he has Maurice with him
Holy Paul forgot about Maurice said Mr Dedalus
Here Maurice
Come here you thickheaded ruffian
Do you know Im going to send youto college where theyll teach you to spell cat
And Ill buyyou nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose dry
Wont thatbe grand fun
Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother
Mr Dedalus screwed his glass into his eye and stared hard at both hissons
Stephen mumbled his bread without answering his fathers gaze
By the bye said Mr Dedalus at length the rector or provincialrather was telling me that story about you and Father Dolan
Youre animpudent thief he said
he didnt Simon
Not he
said Mr Dedalus
But he gave me great account of the wholeaffair
We were chatting you know and one word borrowed another
Andby the way who do you think he told me will get that job in thecorporation
But Ill tell you that after
Well as was saying wewere chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend herewear glasses still and then he told me the whole story
And was he annoyed Simon
Not he
Manly little chap he said
Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial
Father Dolan and when told them all at dinner about it FatherDolan and had great laugh over it
You better mind yourselfFather Dolan said or young Dedalus will send you up for twicenine
We had famous laugh together over it
Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voiceShows you the spirit in which they take the boys there
jesuitfor your life for diplomacy
He reassumed the provincials voice and repeatedI told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan and and all ofus we had hearty laugh together over it
The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen from the windowof the dressingroom looked out on the small grassplot across whichlines of Chinese lanterns were stretched
He watched the visitors comedown the steps from the house and pass into the theatre
Stewards inevening dress old Belvedereans loitered in groups about the entranceto the theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony
Under thesudden glow of lantern he could recognise the smiling face of apriest
The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and thefirst benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altarand the space before it free
Against the walls stood companies ofbarbells and Indian clubs the dumbbells were piled in one corner andin the midst of countless hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters andsinglets in untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketedvaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage and setin the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display
Stephen though in deference to his reputation for essay writing he hadbeen elected secretary to the gymnasium had had no part in the firstsection of the programme but in the play which formed the secondsection he had the chief part that of farcical pedagogue
He hadbeen cast for it on account of his stature and grave manners for he wasnow at the end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two
score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets camepattering down from the stage through the vestry and into the chapel
The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys
Theplump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard ofthe vaulting horse
The lean young man in long overcoat who was togive special display of intricate club swinging stood near watchingwith interest his silvercoated clubs peeping out of his deepsidepockets
The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard asanother team made ready to go up on the stage and in another momentthe excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like aflock of geese flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and cryingto the laggards to make haste
little troop of Neapolitan peasantswere practising their steps at the end of the chapel some circlingtheir arms above their heads some swaying their baskets of paperviolets and curtseying
In dark corner of the chapel at the gospelside of the altar stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts
When she stood up pinkdressed figure wearing curly golden wig andan oldfashioned straw sunbonnet with black pencilled eyebrows andcheeks delicately rouged and powdered was discovered
low murmur ofcuriosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure
One of the prefects smiling and nodding his head approached the darkcorner and having bowed to the stout old lady said pleasantlyIs this beautiful young lady or doll that you have here MrsTallon
Then bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leafof the bonnet he exclaimedNo
Upon my word believe its little Bertie Tallon after all
Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priestlaugh together and heard the boys murmurs of admiration behind him asthey passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance thesunbonnet dance by himself
movement of impatience escaped him
Helet the edge of the blind fall and stepping down from the bench onwhich he had been standing walked out of the chapel
He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flankedthe garden
From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of theaudience and sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers band
The lightspread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem festiveark anchored among the hulks of houses her frail cables of lanternslooping her to her moorings
side door of the theatre opened suddenlyand shaft of light flew across the grassplots
sudden burst ofmusic issued from the ark the prelude of waltz and when the sidedoor closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of themusic
The sentiment of the opening bars their languor and supplemovement evoked the incommunicable emotion which had been the cause ofall his days unrest and of his impatient movement of moment before
His unrest issued from him like wave of sound and on the tide offlowing music the ark was journeying trailing her cables of lanternsin her wake
Then noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement
Itwas the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on thestage
At the far end of the shed near the street speck of pink light showedin the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of faintaromatic odour
Two boys were standing in the shelter of doorwaysmoking and before he reached them he had recognised Heron by hisvoice
Here comes the noble Dedalus
cried high throaty voice
Welcome toour trusty friend
This welcome ended in soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heronsalaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane
Here am said Stephen halting and glancing from Heron to hisfriend
The latter was stranger to him but in the darkness by the aid of theglowing cigarette tips he could make out pale dandyish face overwhich smile was travelling slowly tall overcoated figure and ahard hat
Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but saidinsteadI was just telling my friend Wallis what lark it would be tonight ifyou took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster
It would be aripping good joke
Heron made poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rectorspedantic bass and then laughing at his failure asked Stephen to doit
Go on Dedalus he urged you can take him off rippingly
He thatwill not hear the churcha let him be to theea as the heathena and thepublicanaThe imitation was prevented by mild expression of anger from Wallisin whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged
Damn this blankety blank holder he said taking it from his mouth andsmiling and frowning upon it tolerantly
Its always getting stuck likethat
Do you use holder
dont smoke answered Stephen
No said Heron Dedalus is model youth
He doesnt smoke and hedoesnt go to bazaars and he doesnt flirt and he doesnt damn anythingor damn all
Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rivals flushed and mobileface beaked like birds
He had often thought it strange thatVincent Heron had birds face as well as birds name
shock ofpale hair lay on the forehead like ruffled crest the forehead wasnarrow and bony and thin hooked nose stood out between the closesetprominent eyes which were light and inexpressive
The rivals wereschool friends
They sat together in class knelt together in thechapel talked together after beads over their lunches
As the fellowsin number one were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had beenduring the year the virtual heads of the school
It was they who wentup to the rector together to ask for free day or to get fellow off
by the way said Heron suddenly saw your governor going in
The smile waned on Stephens face
Any allusion made to his father by afellow or by master put his calm to rout in moment
He waited intimorous silence to hear what Heron might say next
Heron howevernudged him expressively with his elbow and saidYoure sly dog
Why so
said Stephen
Youd think butter wouldnt melt in your mouth said Heron
But Imafraid youre sly dog
Might ask you what you are talking about
said Stephen urbanely
Indeed you might answered Heron
We saw her Wallis didnt we
Anddeucedly pretty she is too
And inquisitive
And what part doesStephen take Mr Dedalus
And will Stephen not sing Mr Dedalus Yourgovernor was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he wasworth so that think the old man has found you out too
wouldntcare bit by Jove
Shes ripping isnt she Wallis
Not half bad answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder oncemore in corner of his mouth
shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephens mind at theseindelicate allusions in the hearing of stranger
For him there wasnothing amusing in girls interest and regard
All day he had thoughtof nothing but their leavetaking on the steps of the tram at HaroldsCross the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through himand the poem he had written about it
All day he had imagined newmeeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play
The oldrestless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on thenight of the party but had not found an outlet in verse
The growthand knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and nowforbidding such an outlet and all day the stream of gloomy tendernesswithin him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark coursesand eddies wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefectand the painted little boy had drawn from him movement of impatience
So you may as well admit Heron went on that weve fairly found youout this time
You cant play the saint on me any more thats one surefive
soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and bendingdown as before he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the legwith his cane as if in jesting reproof
Stephens moment of anger had already passed
He was neither flatterednor confused but simply wished the banter to end
He scarcely resentedwhat had seemed to him silly indelicateness for he knew that theadventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words and his facemirrored his rivals false smile
repeated Heron striking him again with his cane across thecalf of the leg
The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one hadbeen
Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almostpainlessly and bowing submissively as if to meet his companionsjesting mood began to recite the Confiteor
The episode ended wellfor both Heron and Wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence
The confession came only from Stephens lips and while they spoke thewords sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up asif by magic at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples atthe corners of Herons smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke ofthe cane against his calf and had heard the familiar word ofadmonitionAdmit
It was towards the close of his first term in the college when he wasin number six
His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashesof an undivined and squalid way of life
His soul was still disquietedand cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin
He had emerged from atwo years spell of reverie to find himself in the midst of newscene every event and figure of which affected him intimatelydisheartened him or allured and whether alluring or dishearteningfilled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts
All the leisurewhich his school life left him was passed in the company of subversivewriters whose gibes and violence of speech set up ferment in hisbrain before they passed out of it into his crude writings
The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every Tuesdayas he marched from home to the school he read his fate in theincidents of the way pitting himself against some figure ahead of himand quickening his pace to outstrip it before certain goal wasreached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of thepatchwork of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first andnot first in the weekly essay
On certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken
MrTate the English master pointed his finger at him and said bluntlyThis fellow has heresy in his essay
hush fell on the class
Mr Tate did not break it but dug with hishand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked abouthis neck and wrists
Stephen did not look up
It was raw springmorning and his eyes were still smarting and weak
He was conscious offailure and of detection of the squalor of his own mind and home andfelt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar
short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease
Perhaps you didnt know that he said
asked Stephen
Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay
Its about the Creator and the soul
Rrm rrm rrm Ah
without possibility of ever approaching nearer Thats heresy
Stephen murmuredI meant without possibility of ever reaching
It was submission and Mr Tate appeased folded up the essay andpassed it across to him sayingO Ah
ever reaching Thats another story
But the class was not so soon appeased
Though nobody spoke to him ofthe affair after class he could feel about him vague generalmalignant joy
few nights after this public chiding he was walking with letteralong the Drumcondra Road when he heard voice cryHalt
He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in thedusk
It was Heron who had called out and as he marched forwardbetween his two attendants he cleft the air before him with thincane in time to their steps
Boland his friend marched beside him alarge grin on his face while Nash came on few steps behind blowingfrom the pace and wagging his great red head
As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together they beganto speak about books and writers saying what books they were readingand how many books there were in their fathers bookcases at home
Stephen listened to them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunceand Nash the idler of the class
In fact after some talk about theirfavourite writers Nash declared for Captain Marryat who he said wasthe greatest writer
said Heron
Ask Dedalus
Who is the greatest writer Dedalus
Stephen noted the mockery in the question and saidOf prose do you mean
Newman think
Is it Cardinal Newman
asked Boland
Yes answered Stephen
The grin broadened on Nashs freckled face as he turned to Stephen andsaidAnd do you like Cardinal Newman Dedalus
many say that Newman has the best prose style Heron said to theother two in explanation of course hes not poet
And who is the best poet Heron
asked Boland
Lord Tennyson of course answered Heron
yes Lord Tennyson said Nash
We have all his poetry at home in abook
At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burstoutTennyson poet
Why hes only rhymester
get out
said Heron
Everyone knows that Tennyson is the greatestpoet
And who do you think is the greatest poet
asked Boland nudging hisneighbour
Byron of course answered Stephen
Heron gave the lead and all three joined in scornful laugh
What are you laughing at
asked Stephen
You said Heron
Byron the greatest poet
Hes only poet foruneducated people
He must be fine poet
said Boland
You may keep your mouth shut said Stephen turning on him boldly
Allyou know about poetry is what you wrote up on the slates in the yardand were going to be sent to the loft for
Boland in fact was said to have written on the slates in the yard acouplet about classmate of his who often rode home from the collegeon pony As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum
This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron went onIn any case Byron was heretic and immoral too
dont care what he was cried Stephen hotly
You dont care whether he was heretic or not
said Nash
What do you know about it
shouted Stephen
You never read line ofanything in your life except trans or Boland either
know that Byron was bad man said Boland
Here catch hold of this heretic Heron called out
In moment Stephen was prisoner
Tate made you buck up the other day Heron went on about the heresyin your essay
Ill tell him tomorrow said Boland
Will you
said Stephen
Youd be afraid to open your lips
Afraid of your life
Behave yourself
cried Heron cutting at Stephens legs with his cane
It was the signal for their onset
Nash pinioned his arms behind whileBoland seized long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter
Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of theknotty stump Stephen was borne back against barbed wire fence
Admit that Byron was no good
At last after fury of plunges he wrenched himself free
Histormentors set off towards Joness Road laughing and jeering at himwhile he half blinded with tears stumbled on clenching his fistsmadly and sobbing
While he was still repeating the Confiteor amid the indulgentlaughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episodewere still passing sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered whyhe bore no malice now to those who had tormented him
He had notforgotten whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of itcalled forth no anger from him
All the descriptions of fierce love andhatred which he had met in books had seemed to him therefore unreal
Even that night as he stumbled homewards along Joness Road he had feltthat some power was divesting him of that suddenwoven anger as easilyas fruit is divested of its soft ripe peel
He remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shedlistening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in thetheatre
She was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for himto appear
He tried to recall her appearance but could not
He couldremember only that she had worn shawl about her head like cowl andthat her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him
He wondered had hebeen in her thoughts as she had been in his
Then in the dark andunseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one handupon the palm of the other hand scarcely touching it lightly
But thepressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier and suddenly thememory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisiblewave
boy came towards them running along under the shed
He was excitedand breathless
Dedalus he cried Doyle is in great bake about you
Youre to goin at once and get dressed for the play
Hurry up you better
Hes coming now said Heron to the messenger with haughty drawlwhen he wants to
The boy turned to Heron and repeatedBut Doyle is in an awful bake
Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that damned his eyes
answered Heron
Well must go now said Stephen who cared little for such points ofhonour
wouldnt said Heron damn me if would
Thats no way to send forone of the senior boys
In bake indeed
think its quite enoughthat youre taking part in his bally old play
This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately inhis rival had not seduced Stephen from his habits of quiet obedience
He mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of suchcomradeship which seemed to him sorry anticipation of manhood
Thequestion of honour here raised was like all such questions trivial tohim
While his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms andturning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him theconstant voices of his father and of his masters urging him to be agentleman above all things and urging him to be good catholic aboveall things
These voices had now come to be hollowsounding in his ears
When the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urginghim to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towardsnational revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voicehad bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her languageand tradition
In the profane world as he foresaw worldly voicewould bid him raise up his fathers fallen state by his labours andmeanwhile the voice of his school comrades urged him to be decentfellow to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do hisbest to get free days for the school
And it was the din of all thesehollowsounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit ofphantoms
He gave them ear only for time but he was happy only whenhe was far from them beyond their call alone or in the company ofphantasmal comrades
In the vestry plump freshfaced jesuit and an elderly man in shabbyblue clothes were dabbling in case of paints and chalks
The boyswho had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly touchingtheir faces in gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips
In themiddle of the vestry young jesuit who was then on visit to thecollege stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toesto his heels and back again his hands thrust well forward into hissidepockets
His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newlyshaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane andwith his spotless shoes
As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself thelegend of the priests mocking smile there came into Stephens memory asaying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent toClongowes that you could always tell jesuit by the style of hisclothes
At the same moment he thought he saw likeness between hisfathers mind and that of this smiling welldressed priest and he wasaware of some desecration of the priests office or of the vestryitself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its airpungent with the smells of the gasjets and the grease
While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black andblue by the elderly man he listened distractedly to the voice of theplump young jesuit which bade him speak up and make his points clearly
He could hear the band playing The Lily of Killarney and knew that ina few moments the curtain would go up
He felt no stage fright but thethought of the part he had to play humiliated him
remembrance ofsome of his lines made sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks
Hesaw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the audience andtheir image at once swept away his scruples leaving his will compact
Another nature seemed to have been lent him the infection of theexcitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moodymistrustfulness
For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in thereal apparel of boyhood and as he stood in the wings among the otherplayers he shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene washauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks and allawry
few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gasand the dim scenery acting before the innumerable faces of the void
It surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsalsfor disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed life of its own
It seemed now to play itself he and his fellow actors aiding it withtheir parts
When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the voidfilled with applause and through rift in side scene saw thesimple body before which he had acted magically deformed the void offaces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups
He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed outthrough the chapel into the college garden
Now that the play was overhis nerves cried for some further adventure
He hurried onwards as ifto overtake it
The doors of the theatre were all open and the audiencehad emptied out
On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of anark few lanterns swung in the night breeze flickering cheerlessly
He mounted the steps from the garden in haste eager that some preyshould not elude him and forced his way through the crowd in the halland past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing andshaking hands with the visitors
He pushed onward nervously feigning astill greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares andnudges which his powdered head left in its wake
When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at thefirst lamp
In glance he noted that every figure of the group wasfamiliar and ran down the steps angrily
have to leave message down in Georges Street he said to hisfather quickly
Ill be home after you
Without waiting for his fathers questions he ran across the road andbegan to walk at breakneck speed down the hill
He hardly knew where hewas walking
Pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heartsent up vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind
Hestrode down the hill amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of woundedpride and fallen hope and baffled desire
They streamed upwards beforehis anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed away abovehim till at last the air was clear and cold again
film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer
power akinto that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him broughthis steps to rest
He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch ofthe morgue and from that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side
Hesaw the word Lotts on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly therank heavy air
That is horse piss and rotted straw he thought
It is good odour tobreathe
It will calm my heart
My heart is quite calm now
will goback
Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner of arailway carriage at Kingsbridge
He was travelling with his father bythe night mail to Cork
As the train steamed out of the station herecalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of hisfirst day at Clongowes
But he felt no wonder now
He saw the darkeninglands slipping away past him the silent telegraphpoles passing hiswindow swiftly every four seconds the little glimmering stationsmanned by few silent sentries flung by the mail behind her andtwinkling for moment in the darkness like fiery grains flungbackwards by runner
He listened without sympathy to his fathers evocation of Cork and ofscenes of his youth tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocketflask whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or wheneverthe evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit
Stephenheard but could feel no pity
The images of the dead were all strangersto him save that of uncle Charles an image which had lately beenfading out of memory
He knew however that his fathers property wasgoing to be sold by auction and in the manner of his own dispossessionhe felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy
At Maryborough he fell asleep
When he awoke the train had passed outof Mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat
Thecold light of the dawn lay over the country over the unpeopled fieldsand the closed cottages
The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as hewatched the silent country or heard from time to time his fathers deepbreath or sudden sleepy movement
The neighbourhood of unseen sleepersfilled him with strange dread as though they could harm him and heprayed that the day might come quickly
His prayer addressed neitherto God nor saint began with shiver as the chilly morning breezecrept through the chink of the carriage door to his feet and ended ina trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm ofthe train and silently at intervals of four seconds thetelegraphpoles held the galloping notes of the music between punctualbars
This furious music allayed his dread and leaning against thewindowledge he let his eyelids close again
They drove in jingle across Cork while it was still early morning andStephen finished his sleep in bedroom of the Victoria Hotel
Thebright warm sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hearthe din of traffic
His father was standing before the dressingtableexamining his hair and face and moustache with great care craning hisneck across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see thebetter
While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accentand phrasing Tis youth and folly Makes young men marry So here my love Ill No longer stay
What cant be cured sure Must be injured sure So Ill go to Amerikay
My love shes handsome My love shes bony Shes like good whisky When it is new But when tis old And growing cold It fades and dies like The mountain dew
The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and thetender tremors with which his fathers voice festooned the strange sadhappy air drove off all the mists of the nights ill humour fromStephens brain
He got up quickly to dress and when the song hadended saidThats much prettier than any of your other comeallyous
Do you think so
asked Mr Dedalus
like it said Stephen
Its pretty old air said Mr Dedalus twirling the points of hismoustache
Ah but you should have heard Mick Lacy sing it
Poor MickLacy
He had little turns for it grace notes that he used to put inthat havent got
That was the boy who could sing comeallyouif you like
Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal hecrossexamined the waiter for local news
For the most part they spokeat cross purposes when name was mentioned the waiter having in mindthe present holder and Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps hisgrandfather
Well hope they havent moved the Queens College anyhow said MrDedalus for want to show it to this youngster of mine
Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom
They entered the grounds ofthe college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle
But their progress across the gravel was brought to halt after everydozen or so paces by some reply of the porters
Ah do you tell me so
And is poor Pottlebelly dead
Yes sir
Dead sir
During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men weary ofthe subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again
By the time they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risento fever
He wondered how his father whom he knew for shrewdsuspicious man could be duped by the servile manners of the porterand the lively southern speech which had entertained him all themorning now irritated his ears
They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus the porteraiding him searched the desks for his initials
Stephen remained inthe background depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence ofthe theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study
On thedesk he read the word Fœtus cut several times in the dark stainedwood
The sudden legend startled his blood he seemed to feel theabsent students of the college about him and to shrink from theircompany
vision of their life which his fathers words had beenpowerless to evoke sprang up before him out of the word cut in thedesk
broadshouldered student with moustache was cutting in theletters with jackknife seriously
Other students stood or sat nearhim laughing at his handiwork
One jogged his elbow
The big studentturned on him frowning
He was dressed in loose grey clothes and hadtan boots
Stephens name was called
He hurried down the steps of the theatre soas to be as far away from the vision as he could be and peeringclosely at his fathers initials hid his flushed face
But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked backacross the quadrangle and towards the college gate
It shocked him tofind in the outer world trace of what he had deemed till then abrutish and individual malady of his own mind
His monstrous reveriescame thronging into his memory
They too had sprung up before himsuddenly and furiously out of mere words
He had soon given in to themand allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect wonderingalways where they came from from what den of monstrous images andalways weak and humble towards others restless and sickened of himselfwhen they had swept over him
Ay bedad
And theres the Groceries sure enough
cried Mr Dedalus
You often heard me speak of the Groceries didnt you Stephen
Manysthe time we went down there when our names had been marked crowd ofus Harry Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and MauriceMoriarty the Frenchman and Tom OGrady and Mick Lacy that told youof this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little goodhearted JohnnyKeevers of the Tantiles
The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and whispering inthe sunlight
team of cricketers passed agile young men in flannelsand blazers one of them carrying the long green wicketbag
In quietbystreet German band of five players in faded uniforms and withbattered brass instruments was playing to an audience of street arabsand leisurely messenger boys
maid in white cap and apron waswatering box of plants on sill which shone like slab of limestonein the warm glare
From another window open to the air came the soundof piano scale after scale rising into the treble
Stephen walked on at his fathers side listening to stories he hadheard before hearing again the names of the scattered and deadrevellers who had been the companions of his fathers youth
And afaint sickness sighed in his heart
He recalled his own equivocalposition in Belvedere free boy leader afraid of his ownauthority proud and sensitive and suspicious battling against thesqualor of his life and against the riot of his mind
The letters cutin the stained wood of the desk stared upon him mocking his bodilyweakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for hisown mad and filthy orgies
The spittle in his throat grew bitter andfoul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that fora moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness
He could still hear his fathers voiceWhen you kick out for yourself Stephenas daresay you will one ofthese daysremember whatever you do to mix with gentlemen
When wasa young fellow tell you enjoyed myself
mixed with fine decentfellows
Everyone of us could do something
One fellow had goodvoice another fellow was good actor another could sing good comicsong another was good oarsman or good racket player another couldtell good story and so on
We kept the ball rolling anyhow andenjoyed ourselves and saw bit of life and we were none the worse ofit either
But we were all gentlemen Stephenat least hope wewereand bloody good honest Irishmen too
Thats the kind of fellows Iwant you to associate with fellows of the right kidney
Im talking toyou as friend Stephen
dont believe son should be afraid of hisfather
No treat you as your grandfather treated me when was ayoung chap
We were more like brothers than father and son
Ill neverforget the first day he caught me smoking
was standing at the end ofthe South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure wethought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the cornersof our mouths
Suddenly the governor passed
He didnt say word orstop even
But the next day Sunday we were out for walk togetherand when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and saidBythe by Simon didnt know you smoked or something like thatOfcourse tried to carry it off as best couldIf you want goodsmoke he said try one of these cigars
An American captain made me apresent of them last night in Queenstown
Stephen heard his fathers voice break into laugh which was almost asob
He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time by God he was
Thewomen used to stand to look after him in the street
He heard the sob passing loudly down his fathers throat and opened hiseyes with nervous impulse
The sunlight breaking suddenly on hissight turned the sky and clouds into fantastic world of sombre masseswith lakelike spaces of dark rosy light
His very brain was sick andpowerless
He could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards ofthe shops
By his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himselfbeyond the limits of reality
Nothing moved him or spoke to him fromthe real world unless he heard in it an echo of the infuriated crieswithin him
He could respond to no earthly or human appeal dumb andinsensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionshipwearied and dejected by his fathers voice
He could scarcely recogniseas his own thoughts and repeated slowly to himselfI am Stephen Dedalus
am walking beside my father whose name isSimon Dedalus
We are in Cork in Ireland
Cork is city
Our room isin the Victoria Hotel
Victoria and Stephen and Simon
Simon andStephen and Victoria
The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim
He tried to call forthsome of its vivid moments but could not
He recalled only names
DanteParnell Clane Clongowes
little boy had been taught geography by anold woman who kept two brushes in her wardrobe
Then he had been sentaway from home to college he had made his first communion and eatenslim jim out of his cricketcap and watched the firelight leaping anddancing on the wall of little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed ofbeing dead of mass being said for him by the rector in black andgold cope of being buried then in the little graveyard of thecommunity off the main avenue of limes
But he had not died then
Parnell had died
There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel andno procession
He had not died but he had faded out like film in thesun
He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longerexisted
How strange to think of him passing out of existence in such away not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost andforgotten somewhere in the universe
It was strange to see his smallbody appear again for moment little boy in grey belted suit
Hishands were in his sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at theknees by elastic bands
On the evening of the day on which the property was sold Stephenfollowed his father meekly about the city from bar to bar
To thesellers in the market to the barmen and barmaids to the beggars whoimportuned him for lob Mr Dedalus told the same tale that he was anold Corkonian that he had been trying for thirty years to get rid ofhis Cork accent up in Dublin and that Peter Pickackafax beside him washis eldest son but that he was only Dublin jackeen
They had set out early in the morning from Newcombes coffeehousewhere Mr Dedalus cup had rattled noisily against its saucer andStephen had tried to cover that shameful sign of his fathers drinkingbout of the night before by moving his chair and coughing
Onehumiliation had succeeded anotherthe false smiles of the marketsellers the curvetings and oglings of the barmaids with whom hisfather flirted the compliments and encouraging words of his fathersfriends
They had told him that he had great look of his grandfatherand Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness
They hadunearthed traces of Cork accent in his speech and made him admit thatthe Lee was much finer river than the Liffey
One of them in orderto put his Latin to the proof had made him translate short passagesfrom Dilectus and asked him whether it was correct to say Temporamutantur nos et mutamur in illis or Tempora mutantur et nos mutamurin illis Another brisk old man whom Mr Dedalus called JohnnyCashman had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which wereprettier the Dublin girls or the Cork girls
Hes not that way built said Mr Dedalus
Leave him alone
Hes alevelheaded thinking boy who doesnt bother his head about that kind ofnonsense
Then hes not his fathers son said the little old man
dont know Im sure said Mr Dedalus smiling complacently
Your father said the little old man to Stephen was the boldest flirtin the city of Cork in his day
Do you know that
Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into whichthey had drifted
Now dont be putting ideas into his head said Mr Dedalus
Leave himto his Maker
Yerra sure wouldnt put any ideas into his head
Im old enough tobe his grandfather
And am grandfather said the little old man toStephen
Do you know that
Are you
asked Stephen
Bedad am said the little old man
have two bouncing grandchildrenout at Sundays Well
Now then
What age do you think am
And Iremember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds
That was before you were born
Ay or thought of said Mr Dedalus
Bedad did repeated the little old man
And more than that canremember even your greatgrandfather old John Stephen Dedalus and afierce old fireeater he was
Now then
Theres memory for you
Thats three generationsfour generations said another of thecompany
Why Johnny Cashman you must be nearing the century
Well Ill tell you the truth said the little old man
Im justtwentyseven years of age
Were as old as we feel Johnny said Mr Dedalus
And just finish whatyou have there and well have another
Here Tim or Tom or whateveryour name is give us the same again here
By God dont feel morethan eighteen myself
Theres that son of mine there not half my ageand Im better man than he is any day of the week
Draw it mild now Dedalus
think its time for you to take backseat said the gentleman who had spoken before
No by God
asserted Mr Dedalus
Ill sing tenor song against him orIll vault fivebarred gate against him or Ill run with him afterthe hounds across the country as did thirty years ago along with theKerry Boy and the best man for it
But hell beat you here said the little old man tapping his foreheadand raising his glass to drain it
Well hope hell be as good man as his father
Thats all cansay said Mr Dedalus
If he is hell do said the little old man
And thanks be to God Johnny said Mr Dedalus that we lived so longand did so little harm
But did so much good Simon said the little old man gravely
Thanksbe to God we lived so long and did so much good
Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as hisfather and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past
An abyssof fortune or of temperament sundered him from them
His mind seemedolder than theirs it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness andregrets like moon upon younger earth
No life or youth stirred inhim as it had stirred in them
He had known neither the pleasure ofcompanionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filialpiety
Nothing stirred within his soul but cold and cruel andloveless lust
His childhood was dead or lost and with it his soulcapable of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barrenshell of the moon
Art thou pale for weariness Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth Wandering companionless
He repeated to himself the lines of Shelleys fragment
Its alternationof sad human ineffectiveness with vast inhuman cycles of activitychilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving
Stephens mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at thecorner of quiet Foster Place while he and his father went up the stepsand along the colonnade where the Highland sentry was parading
Whenthey had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter Stephendrew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirtyand three pounds and these sums the moneys of his exhibition andessay prize were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes andin coin respectively
He bestowed them in his pockets with feignedcomposure and suffered the friendly teller to whom his father chattedto take his hand across the broad counter and wish him brilliantcareer in after life
He was impatient of their voices and could notkeep his feet at rest
But the teller still deferred the serving ofothers to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothinglike giving boy the best education that money could buy
Mr Dedaluslingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and tellingStephen who urged him to come out that they were standing in thehouse of commons of the old Irish parliament
God help us
he said piously to think of the men of those timesStephen Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan and Charles KendalBushe and the noblemen we have now leaders of the Irish people athome and abroad
Why by God they wouldnt be seen dead in tenacrefield with them
No Stephen old chap Im sorry to say that they areonly as roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweetJuly
keen October wind was blowing round the bank
The three figuresstanding at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and wateryeyes
Stephen looked at his thinly clad mother and remembered that afew days before he had seen mantle priced at twenty guineas in thewindows of Barnardos
Well thats done said Mr Dedalus
We had better go to dinner said Stephen
said Mr Dedalus
Well suppose we had better what
Some place thats not too dear said Mrs Dedalus
Some quiet place
Come along said Stephen quickly
It doesnt matter about thedearness
He walked on before them with short nervous steps smiling
They triedto keep up with him smiling also at his eagerness
Take it easy like good young fellow said his father
Were not outfor the half mile are we
For swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran throughStephens fingers
Great parcels of groceries and delicacies and driedfruits arrived from the city
Every day he drew up bill of fare forthe family and every night led party of three or four to the theatreto see Ingomar or The Lady of Lyons
In his coat pockets he carriedsquares of Vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers pocketbulged with masses of silver and copper coins
He bought presents foreveryone overhauled his room wrote out resolutions marshalled hisbooks up and down their shelves pored upon all kinds of price listsdrew up form of commonwealth for the household by which every memberof it held some office opened loan bank for his family and pressedloans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of makingout receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent
When hecould do no more he drove up and down the city in trams
Then theseason of pleasure came to an end
The pot of pink enamel paint gaveout and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished andillplastered coat
His household returned to its usual way of life
His mother had nofurther occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money
He tooreturned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fellto pieces
The commonwealth fell the loan bank closed its coffers andits books on sensible loss the rules of life which he had drawnabout himself fell into desuetude
How foolish his aim had been
He had tried to build breakwater oforder and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and todam up by rules of conduct and active interest and new filialrelations the powerful recurrence of the tides within him
From without as from within the water had flowed over his barrierstheir tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole
He saw clearly too his own futile isolation
He had not gone one stepnearer the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restlessshame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother andsister
He felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stoodto them rather in the mystical kinship of fosterage fosterchild andfosterbrother
He turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before whicheverything else was idle and alien
He cared little that he was inmortal sin that his life had grown to be tissue of subterfuge andfalsehood
Beside the savage desire within him to realise theenormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred
He bore cynicallywith the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted todefile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes
By day andby night he moved among distorted images of the outer world
figurethat had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him bynight through the winding darkness of sleep her face transfigured by alecherous cunning her eyes bright with brutish joy
Only the morningpained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot its keen andhumiliating sense of transgression
He returned to his wanderings
The veiled autumnal evenings led himfrom street to street as they had led him years before along the quietavenues of Blackrock
But no vision of trim front gardens or of kindlylights in the windows poured tender influence upon him now
Only attimes in the pauses of his desire when the luxury that was wastinghim gave room to softer languor the image of Mercedes traversed thebackground of his memory
He saw again the small white house and thegarden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains and heremembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to makethere standing with her in the moonlit garden after years ofestrangement and adventure
At those moments the soft speeches ofClaude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest
tenderpremonition touched him of the tryst he had then looked forward to andin spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then andnow of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which weakness andtimidity and inexperience were to fall from him
Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again
Theverses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspokenbrutal words rushed forth from his brain to force passage
His bloodwas in revolt
He wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peeringinto the gloom of lanes and doorways listening eagerly for any sound
He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast
He wanted to sinwith another of his kind to force another being to sin with him and toexult with her in sin
He felt some dark presence moving irresistiblyupon him from the darkness presence subtle and murmurous as floodfilling him wholly with itself
Its murmur besieged his ears like themurmur of some multitude in sleep its subtle streams penetrated hisbeing
His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as hesuffered the agony of its penetration
He stretched out his arms in thestreet to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and incitedhim and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issuedfrom his lips
It broke from him like wail of despair from hell ofsufferers and died in wail of furious entreaty cry for aniniquitous abandonment cry which was but the echo of an obscenescrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of urinal
He had wandered into maze of narrow and dirty streets
From the foullaneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawlingof drunken singers
He walked onward undismayed wondering whether hehad strayed into the quarter of the jews
Women and girls dressed inlong vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house
They wereleisurely and perfumed
trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim
The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vision against thevapoury sky burning as if before an altar
Before the doors and in thelighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite
He was inanother world he had awakened from slumber of centuries
He stood still in the middle of the roadway his heart clamouringagainst his bosom in tumult
young woman dressed in long pinkgown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face
She said gailyGood night Willie dear
Her room was warm and lightsome
huge doll sat with her legs apart inthe copious easychair beside the bed
He tried to bid his tongue speakthat he might seem at ease watching her as she undid her gown notingthe proud conscious movements of her perfumed head
As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him andembraced him gaily and gravely
Her round arms held him firmly to herand he seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling thewarm calm rise and fall of her breast all but burst into hystericalweeping
Tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and hislips parted though they would not speak
She passed her tinkling hand through his hair calling him littlerascal
Give me kiss she said
His lips would not bend to kiss her
He wanted to be held firmly in herarms to be caressed slowly slowly slowly
In her arms he felt thathe had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself
But hislips would not bend to kiss her
With sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to hisand he read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes
Itwas too much for him
He closed his eyes surrendering himself to herbody and mind conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressureof her softly parting lips
They pressed upon his brain as upon hislips as though they were the vehicle of vague speech and betweenthem he felt an unknown and timid pressure darker than the swoon ofsin softer than sound or odour
Chapter IIIThe swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after its dull dayand as he stared through the dull square of the window of theschoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food
He hoped there wouldbe stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fatmutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flourfattened sauce
Stuff it into you his belly counselled him
It would be gloomy secret night
After early nightfall the yellowlamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of thebrothels
He would follow devious course up and down the streetscircling always nearer and nearer in tremor of fear and joy untilhis feet led him suddenly round dark corner
The whores would be justcoming out of their houses making ready for the night yawning lazilyafter their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair
He would pass by them calmly waiting for sudden movement of his ownwill or sudden call to his sinloving soul from their soft perfumedflesh
Yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses stultifiedonly by his desire would note keenly all that wounded or shamed themhis eyes ring of porter froth on clothless table or photographof two soldiers standing to attention or gaudy playbill his earsthe drawling jargon of greetingHello Bertie any good in your mind
Is that you pigeon
Number ten
Fresh Nelly is waiting on you
Good night husband
Coming in to have short time
The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out awidening tail eyed and starred like peacocks and when the eyesand stars of its indices had been eliminated began slowly to folditself together again
The indices appearing and disappearing were eyesopening and closing the eyes opening and closing were stars being bornand being quenched
The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mindoutward to its verge and inward to its centre distant musicaccompanying him outward and inward
What music
The music came nearerand he recalled the words the words of Shelleys fragment upon themoon wandering companionless pale for weariness
The stars began tocrumble and cloud of fine stardust fell through space
The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equationbegan to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
It was his own soul going forth to experience unfolding itself sin bysin spreading abroad the balefire of its burning stars and foldingback upon itself fading slowly quenching its own lights and fires
They were quenched and the cold darkness filled chaos
cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
At his first violent sinhe had felt wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to findhis body or his soul maimed by the excess
Instead the vital wave hadcarried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it recededand no part of body or soul had been maimed but dark peace had beenestablished between them
The chaos in which his ardour extinguisheditself was cold indifferent knowledge of himself
He had sinnedmortally not once but many times and he knew that while he stood indanger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone by everysucceeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment
His days andworks and thoughts could make no atonement for him the fountains ofsanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul
At most by analms given to beggar whose blessing he fled from he might hopewearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace
Devotion hadgone by the board
What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soullusted after its own destruction
certain pride certain awewithheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night though heknew it was in Gods power to take away his life while he slept andhurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy
His pride in his ownsin his loveless awe of God told him that his offence was toogrievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by false homage to theAllseeing and Allknowing
Well now Ennis declare you have head and so has my stick
Do youmean to say that you are not able to tell me what surd is
The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of hisfellows
Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear
On Sundaymornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at theworshippers who stood bareheaded four deep outside the churchmorally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear
Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hairoil with whichthey had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayedat
He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others sceptical of theirinnocence which he could cajole so easily
On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll the certificateof his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the Blessed VirginMary
On Saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel torecite the little office his place was cushioned kneelingdesk at theright of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through theresponses
The falsehood of his position did not pain him
If atmoments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour andconfessing before them all his unworthiness to leave the chapel aglance at their faces restrained him
The imagery of the psalms ofprophecy soothed his barren pride
The glories of Mary held his soulcaptive spikenard and myrrh and frankincense symbolising her royallineage her emblems the lateflowering plant and lateblossomingtree symbolising the agelong gradual growth of her cultus among men
When it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the officehe read it in veiled voice lulling his conscience to its music
Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cupressus in monte Sion
Quasi palma exaltata sum in Gades et quasi plantatio rosae in Jericho
Quasi uliva speciosa in campis et quasi platanus exaltata sum juxtaaquam in plateis
Sicut cinnamomum et balsamum aromatizans odorem dediet quasi myrrha electa dedi suavitatem odorisHis sin which had covered him from the sight of God had led himnearer to the refuge of sinners
Her eyes seemed to regard him withmild pity her holiness strange light glowing faintly upon her frailflesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
If ever he wasimpelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved himwas the wish to be her knight
If ever his soul reentering herdwelling shyly after the frenzy of his bodys lust had spent itselfwas turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star bright andmusical telling of heaven and infusing peace it was when her nameswere murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul andshameful words the savour itself of lewd kiss
That was strange
He tried to think how it could be but the duskdeepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts
The bell rang
The master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson andwent out
Heron beside Stephen began to hum tunelessly
My excellent friend Bombados
Ennis who had gone to the yard came back sayingThe boy from the house is coming up for the rector
tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and saidThats game ball
We can scut the whole hour
He wont be in tillafter half two
Then you can ask him questions on the catechismDedalus
Stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened tothe talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by sayingShut up will you
Dont make such bally racket
It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up tothe end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetratinginto obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his owncondemnation
The sentence of saint James which says that he whooffends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to himfirst swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness ofhis own state
From the evil seed of lust all other deadly sins hadsprung forth pride in himself and contempt of others covetousness inusing money for the purchase of unlawful pleasures envy of those whosevices he could not reach to and calumnious murmuring against the piousgluttonous enjoyment of food the dull glowering anger amid which hebrooded upon his longing the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth inwhich his whole being had sunk
As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rectors shrewd harsh facehis mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed toit
If man had stolen pound in his youth and had used that pound toamass huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound hehad stolen only or the pound together with the compound interestaccruing upon it or all his huge fortune
If layman in giving baptismpour the water before saying the words is the child baptised
Isbaptism with mineral water valid
How comes it that while the firstbeatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart thesecond beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess theland
Why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the twospecies of bread and wine if Jesus Christ be present body and bloodsoul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
Does atiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and bloodof Jesus Christ or part only of the body and blood
If the winechange into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after theyhave been consecrated is Jesus Christ still present under theirspecies as God and as man
Here he is
Here he is
boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from thehouse
All the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon themsilently
The rector entered and took his seat on the dais
gentlekick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask adifficult question
The rector did not ask for catechism to hear the lesson from
Heclasped his hands on the desk and saidThe retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of saintFrancis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday
The retreat will go on fromWednesday to Friday
On Friday confession will be heard all theafternoon after beads
If any boys have special confessors perhaps itwill be better for them not to change
Mass will be on Saturday morningat nine oclock and general communion for the whole college
Saturdaywill be free day
But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boysmight be inclined to think that Monday is free day also
Beware ofmaking that mistake
think you Lawless are likely to make thatmistake
Why sir
little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys fromthe rectors grim smile
Stephens heart began slowly to fold and fadewith fear like withering flower
The rector went on gravelyYou are all familiar with the story of the life of saint FrancisXavier suppose the patron of your college
He came of an old andillustrious Spanish family and you remember that he was one of thefirst followers of saint Ignatius
They met in Paris where FrancisXavier was professor of philosophy at the university
This young andbrilliant nobleman and man of letters entered heart and soul into theideas of our glorious founder and you know that he at his own desirewas sent by saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians
He is called asyou know the apostle of the Indies
He went from country to country inthe east from Africa to India from India to Japan baptising thepeople
He is said to have baptised as many as ten thousand idolatersin one month
It is said that his right arm had grown powerless fromhaving been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptised
He wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but hedied of fever on the island of Sancian
great saint saint FrancisXavier
great soldier of God
The rector paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him wentonHe had the faith in him that moves mountains
Ten thousand souls wonfor God in single month
That is true conqueror true to the mottoof our order ad majorem Dei gloriam saint who has great power inheaven remember power to intercede for us in our grief power toobtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls powerabove all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin
greatsaint saint Francis Xavier
great fisher of souls
He ceased to shake his clasped hands and resting them against hisforehead looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out ofhis dark stern eyes
In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into tawny glow
Stephens heart had withered up like flower of the desert that feelsthe simoom coming from afar
Remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin for everwordstaken my dear little brothers in Christ from the book ofEcclesiastes seventh chapter fortieth verse
In the name of theFather and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel
Father Arnall sat at atable to the left of the altar
He wore about his shoulders heavycloak his pale face was drawn and his voice broken with rheum
Thefigure of his old master so strangely rearisen brought back toStephens mind his life at Clongowes the wide playgrounds swarmingwith boys the square ditch the little cemetery off the main avenue oflimes where he had dreamed of being buried the firelight on the wallof the infirmary where he lay sick the sorrowful face of BrotherMichael
His soul as these memories came back to him became again achilds soul
We are assembled here today my dear little brothers in Christ forone brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world tocelebrate and to honour one of the greatest of saints the apostle ofthe Indies the patron saint also of your college saint FrancisXavier
Year after year for much longer than any of you my dear littleboys can remember or than can remember the boys of this college havemet in this very chapel to make their annual retreat before the feastday of their patron saint
Time has gone on and brought with it itschanges
Even in the last few years what changes can most of you notremember
Many of the boys who sat in those front benches few yearsago are perhaps now in distant lands in the burning tropics orimmersed in professional duties or in seminaries or voyaging over thevast expanse of the deep or it may be already called by the great Godto another life and to the rendering up of their stewardship
And stillas the years roll by bringing with them changes for good and bad thememory of the great saint is honoured by the boys of this college whomake every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feastday set apart by our Holy Mother the Church to transmit to all the agesthe name and fame of one of the greatest sons of catholic Spain
Now what is the meaning of this word retreat and why is it allowedon all hands to be most salutary practice for all who desire to leadbefore God and in the eyes of men truly christian life
retreat mydear boys signifies withdrawal for while from the cares of ourlife the cares of this workaday world in order to examine the stateof our conscience to reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and tounderstand better why we are here in this world
During these few daysI intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four lastthings
They are as you know from your catechism death judgementhell and heaven
We shall try to understand them fully during these fewdays so that we may derive from the understanding of them lastingbenefit to our souls
And remember my dear boys that we have beensent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone to do Godsholy will and to save our immortal souls
All else is worthless
Onething alone is needful the salvation of ones soul
What doth itprofit man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of hisimmortal soul
Ah my dear boys believe me there is nothing in thiswretched world that can make up for such loss
will ask you therefore my dear boys to put away from your mindsduring these few days all worldly thoughts whether of study orpleasure or ambition and to give all your attention to the state ofyour souls
need hardly remind you that during the days of theretreat all boys are expected to preserve quiet and pious demeanourand to shun all loud unseemly pleasure
The elder boys of course willsee that this custom is not infringed and look especially to theprefects and officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of thesodality of the holy angels to set good example to theirfellowstudents
Let us try therefore to make this retreat in honour of saint Franciswith our whole heart and our whole mind
Gods blessing will then beupon all your years studies
But above and beyond all let thisretreat be one to which you can look back in after years when maybeyou are far from this college and among very different surroundings towhich you can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks toGod for having granted you this occasion of laying the first foundationof pious honourable zealous christian life
And if as may so happenthere be at this moment in these benches any poor soul who has had theunutterable misfortune to lose Gods holy grace and to fall intogrievous sin fervently trust and pray that this retreat may be theturning point in the life of that soul
pray to God through themerits of His zealous servant Francis Xavier that such soul may beled to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on saintFranciss day of this year may be lasting covenant between God andthat soul
For just and unjust for saint and sinner alike may thisretreat be memorable one
Help me my dear little brothers in Christ
Help me by your piousattention by your own devotion by your outward demeanour
Banish fromyour minds all worldly thoughts and think only of the last thingsdeath judgement hell and heaven
He who remembers these things saysEcclesiastes shall not sin for ever
He who remembers the last thingswill act and think with them always before his eyes
He will live agood life and die good death believing and knowing that if he hassacrificed much in this earthly life it will be given to him ahundredfold and thousandfold more in the life to come in the kingdomwithout enda blessing my dear boys which wish you from my heartone and all in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the HolyGhost
As he walked home with silent companions thick fog seemed to compasshis mind
He waited in stupor of mind till it should lift and revealwhat it had hidden
He ate his dinner with surly appetite and when themeal was over and the greasestrewn plates lay abandoned on the tablehe rose and went to the window clearing the thick scum from his mouthwith his tongue and licking it from his lips
So he had sunk to thestate of beast that licks his chaps after meat
This was the end anda faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind
He pressedhis face against the pane of the window and gazed out into thedarkening street
Forms passed this way and that through the dulllight
And that was life
The letters of the name of Dublin lay heavilyupon his mind pushing one another surlily hither and thither with slowboorish insistence
His soul was fattening and congealing into grossgrease plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into sombre threateningdusk while the body that was his stood listless and dishonouredgazing out of darkened eyes helpless perturbed and human for bovinegod to stare upon
The next day brought death and judgement stirring his soul slowly fromits listless despair
The faint glimmer of fear became terror ofspirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew death into his soul
Hesuffered its agony
He felt the deathchill touch the extremities andcreep onward towards the heart the film of death veiling the eyes thebright centres of the brain extinguished one by one like lamps thelast sweat oozing upon the skin the powerlessness of the dying limbsthe speech thickening and wandering and failing the heart throbbingfaintly and more faintly all but vanquished the breath the poorbreath the poor helpless human spirit sobbing and sighing gurglingand rattling in the throat
No help
No help
Hehe himselfhis body towhich he had yielded was dying
Into the grave with it
Nail it downinto wooden box the corpse
Carry it out of the house on theshoulders of hirelings
Thrust it out of mens sight into long holein the ground into the grave to rot to feed the mass of its creepingworms and to be devoured by scuttling plumpbellied rats
And while the friends were still standing in tears by the bedside thesoul of the sinner was judged
At the last moment of consciousness thewhole earthly life passed before the vision of the soul and ere it hadtime to reflect the body had died and the soul stood terrified beforethe judgement seat
God who had long been merciful would then bejust
He had long been patient pleading with the sinful soul givingit time to repent sparing it yet awhile
But that time had gone
Timewas to sin and to enjoy time was to scoff at God and at the warningsof His holy church time was to defy His majesty to disobey Hiscommands to hoodwink ones fellow men to commit sin after sin and tohide ones corruption from the sight of men
But that time was over
Now it was Gods turn and He was not to be hoodwinked or deceived
Every sin would then come forth from its lurkingplace the mostrebellious against the divine will and the most degrading to our poorcorrupt nature the tiniest imperfection and the most heinous atrocity
What did it avail then to have been great emperor great general amarvellous inventor the most learned of the learned
All were as onebefore the judgement seat of God
He would reward the good and punishthe wicked
One single instant was enough for the trial of manssoul
One single instant after the bodys death the soul had beenweighed in the balance
The particular judgement was over and the soulhad passed to the abode of bliss or to the prison of purgatory or hadbeen hurled howling into hell
Nor was that all
Gods justice had still to be vindicated before menafter the particular there still remained the general judgement
Thelast day had come
Doomsday was at hand
The stars of heaven werefalling upon the earth like the figs cast by the figtree which the windhas shaken
The sun the great luminary of the universe had become assackcloth of hair
The moon was bloodred
The firmament was as scrollrolled away
The archangel Michael the prince of the heavenly hostappeared glorious and terrible against the sky
With one foot on thesea and one foot on the land he blew from the archangelical trumpet thebrazen death of time
The three blasts of the angel filled all theuniverse
Time is time was but time shall be no more
At the lastblast the souls of universal humanity throng towards the valley ofJehosaphat rich and poor gentle and simple wise and foolish goodand wicked
The soul of every human being that has ever existed thesouls of all those who shall yet be born all the sons and daughters ofAdam all are assembled on that supreme day
And lo the supreme judgeis coming
No longer the lowly Lamb of God no longer the meek Jesus ofNazareth no longer the Man of Sorrows no longer the Good Shepherd Heis seen now coming upon the clouds in great power and majestyattended by nine choirs of angels angels and archangelsprincipalities powers and virtues thrones and dominations cherubimand seraphim God Omnipotent God Everlasting
He speaks and His voiceis heard even at the farthest limits of space even in the bottomlessabyss
Supreme Judge from His sentence there will be and can be noappeal
He calls the just to His side bidding them enter into thekingdom the eternity of bliss prepared for them
The unjust He castsfrom Him crying in His offended majesty Depart from me ye cursedinto everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angelsO what agony then for the miserable sinners
Friend is torn apart fromfriend children are torn from their parents husbands from theirwives
The poor sinner holds out his arms to those who were dear to himin this earthly world to those whose simple piety perhaps he made amock of to those who counselled him and tried to lead him on the rightpath to kind brother to loving sister to the mother and fatherwho loved him so dearly
But it is too late the just turn away fromthe wretched damned souls which now appear before the eyes of all intheir hideous and evil character
you hypocrites you whitedsepulchres you who present smooth smiling face to the world whileyour soul within is foul swamp of sin how will it fare with you inthat terrible day
And this day will come shall come must come the day of death and theday of judgement
It is appointed unto man to die and after death thejudgement
Death is certain
The time and manner are uncertain whetherfrom long disease or from some unexpected accident the Son of Godcometh at an hour when you little expect Him
Be therefore ready everymoment seeing that you may die at any moment
Death is the end of usall
Death and judgement brought into the world by the sin of ourfirst parents are the dark portals that close our earthly existencethe portals that open into the unknown and the unseen portals throughwhich every soul must pass alone unaided save by its good workswithout friend or brother or parent or master to help it alone andtrembling
Let that thought be ever before our minds and then we cannotsin
Death cause of terror to the sinner is blessed moment forhim who has walked in the right path fulfilling the duties of hisstation in life attending to his morning and evening prayersapproaching the holy sacrament frequently and performing good andmerciful works
For the pious and believing catholic for the just mandeath is no cause of terror
Was it not Addison the great Englishwriter who when on his deathbed sent for the wicked young earl ofWarwick to let him see how christian can meet his end
He it is andhe alone the pious and believing christian who can say in his heart grave where is thy victory
death where is thy sting
Every word of it was for him
Against his sin foul and secret thewhole wrath of God was aimed
The preachers knife had probed deeplyinto his disclosed conscience and he felt now that his soul wasfestering in sin
Yes the preacher was right
Gods turn had come
Like beast in its lair his soul had lain down in its own filth butthe blasts of the angels trumpet had driven him forth from thedarkness of sin into the light
The words of doom cried by the angelshattered in an instant his presumptuous peace
The wind of the lastday blew through his mind his sins the jeweleyed harlots of hisimagination fled before the hurricane squeaking like mice in theirterror and huddled under mane of hair
As he crossed the square walking homeward the light laughter of agirl reached his burning ear
The frail gay sound smote his heart morestrongly than trumpetblast and not daring to lift his eyes heturned aside and gazed as he walked into the shadow of the tangledshrubs
Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being
The image of Emma appeared before him and under her eyes the flood ofshame rushed forth anew from his heart
If she knew to what his mindhad subjected her or how his brutelike lust had torn and trampled uponher innocence
Was that boyish love
Was that chivalry
Was thatpoetry
The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils
The sootcoated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue ofthe fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashfulwantonness he lay for hours sinning in thought and deed his monstrousdreams peopled by apelike creatures and by harlots with gleaming jeweleyes the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guiltyconfession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw themunder cover of night among the grass in the corner of field orbeneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where girlmight come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly
Was it possible he had done these things
cold sweat broke out uponhis forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain
When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to raise his soulfrom its abject powerlessness
God and the Blessed Virgin were too farfrom him God was too great and stern and the Blessed Virgin too pureand holy
But he imagined that he stood near Emma in wide land andhumbly and in tears bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve
In the wide land under tender lucid evening sky cloud driftingwestward amid pale green sea of heaven they stood together childrenthat had erred
Their error had offended deeply Gods majesty though itwas the error of two children but it had not offended her whose beautyis not like earthly beauty dangerous to look upon but like themorning star which is its emblem bright and musical The eyes werenot offended which she turned upon him nor reproachful
She placedtheir hands together hand in hand and said speaking to their heartsTake hands Stephen and Emma
It is beautiful evening now in heaven
You have erred but you are always my children
It is one heart thatloves another heart
Take hands together my dear children and youwill be happy together and your hearts will love each other
The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered throughthe lowered blinds and through the fissure between the last blind andthe sash shaft of wan light entered like spear and touched theembossed brasses of the candlesticks upon the altar that gleamed likethe battleworn mail armour of angels
Rain was falling on the chapel on the garden on the college
It wouldrain for ever noiselessly
The water would rise inch by inch coveringthe grass and shrubs covering the trees and houses covering themonuments and the mountain tops
All life would be choked offnoiselessly birds men elephants pigs children noiselesslyfloating corpses amid the litter of the wreckage of the world
Fortydays and forty nights the rain would fall till the waters covered theface of the earth
It might be
Why not
Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth without anylimitswords taken my dear little brothers in Christ Jesus from thebook of Isaias fifth chapter fourteenth verse
In the name of theFather and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
The preacher took chainless watch from pocket within his soutaneand having considered its dial for moment in silence placed itsilently before him on the table
He began to speak in quiet tone
Adam and Eve my dear boys were as you know our first parents andyou will remember that they were created by God in order that the seatsin heaven left vacant by the fall of Lucifer and his rebellious angelsmight be filled again
Lucifer we are told was son of the morninga radiant and mighty angel yet he fell he fell and there fell withhim third part of the host of heaven he fell and was hurled with hisrebellious angels into hell
What his sin was we cannot say
Theologians consider that it was the sin of pride the sinful thoughtconceived in an instant non serviam will not serve That instantwas his ruin
He offended the majesty of God by the sinful thought of one instant andGod cast him out of heaven into hell for ever
Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in Eden in the plainof Damascus that lovely garden resplendent with sunlight and colourteeming with luxuriant vegetation
The fruitful earth gave them herbounty beasts and birds were their willing servants they knew not theills our flesh is heir to disease and poverty and death all that agreat and generous God could do for them was done
But there was onecondition imposed on them by God obedience to His word
They were notto eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree
Alas my dear little boys they too fell
The devil once shiningangel son of the morning now foul fiend came in the shape of aserpent the subtlest of all the beasts of the field
He envied them
He the fallen great one could not bear to think that man being ofclay should possess the inheritance which he by his sin had forfeitedfor ever
He came to the woman the weaker vessel and poured thepoison of his eloquence into her ear promising herO the blasphemy ofthat promisethat if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit theywould become as gods nay as God Himself
Eve yielded to the wiles ofthe arch tempter
She ate the apple and gave it also to Adam who hadnot the moral courage to resist her
The poison tongue of Satan haddone its work
They fell
And then the voice of God was heard in that garden calling Hiscreature man to account and Michael prince of the heavenly host witha sword of flame in his hand appeared before the guilty pair and drovethem forth from Eden into the world the world of sickness andstriving of cruelty and disappointment of labour and hardship toearn their bread in the sweat of their brow
But even then how mercifulwas God
He took pity on our poor degraded parents and promised that inthe fullness of time He would send down from heaven One who wouldredeem them make them once more children of God and heirs to thekingdom of heaven and that One that Redeemer of fallen man was to beGods only begotten Son the Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinitythe Eternal Word
He came
He was born of virgin pure Mary the virgin mother
He wasborn in poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as humble carpenter forthirty years until the hour of His mission had come
And then filledwith love for men He went forth and called to men to hear the newgospel
Did they listen
Yes they listened but would not hear
He was seizedand bound like common criminal mocked at as fool set aside togive place to public robber scourged with five thousand lashescrowned with crown of thorns hustled through the streets by thejewish rabble and the Roman soldiery stripped of his garments andhanged upon gibbet and His side was pierced with lance and from thewounded body of our Lord water and blood issued continually
Yet even then in that hour of supreme agony Our Merciful Redeemerhad pity for mankind
Yet even there on the hill of Calvary Hefounded the holy catholic church against which it is promised thegates of hell shall not prevail
He founded it upon the rock of agesand endowed it with His grace with sacraments and sacrifice andpromised that if men would obey the word of His church they would stillenter into eternal life but if after all that had been done for themthey still persisted in their wickedness there remained for them aneternity of torment hell
The preachers voice sank
He paused joined his palms for an instantparted them
Then he resumedNow let us try for moment to realise as far as we can the natureof that abode of the damned which the justice of an offended God hascalled into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners
Hell is astrait and dark and foulsmelling prison an abode of demons and lostsouls filled with fire and smoke
The straitness of this prison houseis expressly designed by God to punish those who refused to be bound byHis laws
In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some libertyof movement were it only within the four walls of his cell or in thegloomy yard of his prison
Not so in hell
There by reason of thegreat number of the damned the prisoners are heaped together in theirawful prison the walls of which are said to be four thousand milesthick and the damned are so utterly bound and helpless that as ablessed saint saint Anselm writes in his book on similitudes theyare not even able to remove from the eye worm that gnaws it
They lie in exterior darkness
For remember the fire of hell givesforth no light
As at the command of God the fire of the Babylonianfurnace lost its heat but not its light so at the command of God thefire of hell while retaining the intensity of its heat burnseternally in darkness
It is neverending storm of darkness darkflames and dark smoke of burning brimstone amid which the bodies areheaped one upon another without even glimpse of air
Of all theplagues with which the land of the Pharaohs were smitten one plaguealone that of darkness was called horrible
What name then shall wegive to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alonebut for all eternity
The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awfulstench
All the filth of the world all the offal and scum of theworld we are told shall run there as to vast reeking sewer when theterrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world
Thebrimstone too which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills allhell with its intolerable stench and the bodies of the damnedthemselves exhale such pestilential odour that as saint Bonaventuresays one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world
Thevery air of this world that pure element becomes foul andunbreathable when it has been long enclosed
Consider then what must bethe foulness of the air of hell
Imagine some foul and putrid corpsethat has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave jellylike mass ofliquid corruption
Imagine such corpse prey to flames devoured bythe fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes ofnauseous loathsome decomposition
And then imagine this sickeningstench multiplied millionfold and millionfold again from themillions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in thereeking darkness huge and rotting human fungus
Imagine all thisand you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell
But this stench is not horrible though it is the greatest physicaltorment to which the damned are subjected
The torment of fire is thegreatest torment to which the tyrant has ever subjected his fellowcreatures
Place your finger for moment in the flame of candle andyou will feel the pain of fire
But our earthly fire was created by Godfor the benefit of man to maintain in him the spark of life and tohelp him in the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of anotherquality and was created by God to torture and punish the unrepentantsinner
Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly accordingas the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so thathuman ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical preparationsto check or frustrate its action
But the sulphurous brimstone whichburns in hell is substance which is specially designed to burn forever and for ever with unspeakable fury
Moreover our earthly firedestroys at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it isthe shorter is its duration but the fire of hell has this propertythat it preserves that which it burns and though it rages withincredible intensity it rages for ever
Our earthly fire again no matter how fierce or widespread it may beis always of limited extent but the lake of fire in hell isboundless shoreless and bottomless
It is on record that the devilhimself when asked the question by certain soldier was obliged toconfess that if whole mountain were thrown into the burning ocean ofhell it would be burned up in an instant like piece of wax
And thisterrible fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only fromwithout but each lost soul will be hell unto itself the boundlessfire raging in its very vitals
how terrible is the lot of thosewretched beings
The blood seethes and boils in the veins the brainsare boiling in the skull the heart in the breast glowing and burstingthe bowels redhot mass of burning pulp the tender eyes flaming likemolten balls
And yet what have said as to the strength and quality andboundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to itsintensity an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen bydivine design for the punishment of soul and body alike
It is firewhich proceeds directly from the ire of God working not of its ownactivity but as an instrument of divine vengeance
As the waters ofbaptism cleanse the soul with the body so do the fires of punishmenttorture the spirit with the flesh
Every sense of the flesh is torturedand every faculty of the soul therewith the eyes with impenetrableutter darkness the nose with noisome odours the ears with yells andhowls and execrations the taste with foul matter leprous corruptionnameless suffocating filth the touch with redhot goads and spikeswith cruel tongues of flame
And through the several torments of thesenses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amidthe leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by theoffended majesty of the Omnipotent God and fanned into everlasting andeverincreasing fury by the breath of the anger of the Godhead
Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increasedby the company of the damned themselves
Evil company on earth is sonoxious that the plants as if by instinct withdraw from the companyof whatsoever is deadly or hurtful to them
In hell all laws areoverturnedthere is no thought of family or country of ties ofrelationships
The damned howl and scream at one another their tortureand rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging likethemselves
All sense of humanity is forgotten
The yells of thesuffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss
Themouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and of hatredfor their fellow sufferers and of curses against those souls which weretheir accomplices in sin
In olden times it was the custom to punishthe parricide the man who had raised his murderous hand against hisfather by casting him into the depths of the sea in sack in whichwere placed cock monkey and serpent
The intention of thoselawgivers who framed such law which seems cruel in our times wasto punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beasts
But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared with the fury ofexecration which bursts from the parched lips and aching throats of thedamned in hell when they behold in their companions in misery those whoaided and abetted them in sin those whose words sowed the first seedsof evil thinking and evil living in their minds those whose immodestsuggestions led them on to sin those whose eyes tempted and alluredthem from the path of virtue
They turn upon those accomplices andupbraid them and curse them
But they are helpless and hopeless it istoo late now for repentance
Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned soulstempters and tempted alike of the company of the devils
These devilswill afflict the damned in two ways by their presence and by theirreproaches
We can have no idea of how horrible these devils are
SaintCatherine of Siena once saw devil and she has written that ratherthan look again for one single instant on such frightful monster shewould prefer to walk until the end of her life along track of redcoals
These devils who were once beautiful angels have become ashideous and ugly as they once were beautiful
They mock and jeer at thelost souls whom they dragged down to ruin
It is they the foul demonswho are made in hell the voices of conscience
Why did you sin
Why didyou lend an ear to the temptings of friends
Why did you turn asidefrom your pious practices and good works
Why did you not shun theoccasions of sin
Why did you not leave that evil companion
Why didyou not give up that lewd habit that impure habit
Why did you notlisten to the counsels of your confessor
Why did you not even afteryou had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth orthe hundredth time repent of your evil ways and turn to God who onlywaited for your repentance to absolve you of your sins
Now the timefor repentance has gone by
Time is time was but time shall be nomore
Time was to sin in secrecy to indulge in that sloth and prideto covet the unlawful to yield to the promptings of your lower natureto live like the beasts of the field nay worse than the beasts of thefield for they at least are but brutes and have no reason to guidethem time was but time shall be no more
God spoke to you by so manyvoices but you would not hear
You would not crush out that pride andanger in your heart you would not restore those illgotten goods youwould not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to yourreligious duties you would not abandon those wicked companions youwould not avoid those dangerous temptations
Such is the language ofthose fiendish tormentors words of taunting and of reproach of hatredand of disgust
Of disgust yes
For even they the very devils whenthey sinned sinned by such sin as alone was compatible with suchangelical natures rebellion of the intellect and they even theythe foul devils must turn away revolted and disgusted from thecontemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded man outragesand defiles the temple of the Holy Ghost defiles and pollutes himself
my dear little brothers in Christ may it never be our lot to hearthat language
May it never be our lot say
In the last day ofterrible reckoning pray fervently to God that not single soul ofthose who are in this chapel today may be found among those miserablebeings whom the Great Judge shall command to depart for ever from Hissight that not one of us may ever hear ringing in his ears the awfulsentence of rejection Depart from me ye cursed into everlastingfire which was prepared for the devil and his angelsHe came down the aisle of the chapel his legs shaking and the scalp ofhis head trembling as though it had been touched by ghostly fingers
Hepassed up the staircase and into the corridor along the walls of whichthe overcoats and waterproofs hung like gibbeted malefactors headlessand dripping and shapeless
And at every step he feared that he hadalready died that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath ofhis body that he was plunging headlong through space
He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at his deskopening one of his books at random and poring over it
Every word forhim
It was true
God was almighty
God could call him now call him ashe sat at his desk before he had time to be conscious of the summons
God had called him
His flesh shrank together as itfelt the approach of the ravenous tongues of flames dried up as itfelt about it the swirl of stifling air
He had died
He wasjudged
wave of fire swept through his body the first
Again wave
His brain began to glow
His brain was simmering and bubblingwithin the cracking tenement of the skull
Flames burst forth from hisskull like corolla shrieking like voicesHell
Voices spoke near himOn hell
suppose he rubbed it into you well
You bet he did
He put us all into blue funk
Thats what you fellows want and plenty of it to make you work
He leaned back weakly in his desk
He had not died
God had spared himstill
He was still in the familiar world of the school
Mr Tate andVincent Heron stood at the window talking jesting gazing out at thebleak rain moving their heads
wish it would clear up
had arranged to go for spin on the bikewith some fellows out by Malahide
But the roads must be kneedeep
It might clear up sir
The voices that he knew so well the common words the quiet of theclassroom when the voices paused and the silence was filled by thesound of softly browsing cattle as the other boys munched their lunchestranquilly lulled his aching soul
There was still time
Mary refuge of sinners intercede for him
OVirgin Undefiled save him from the gulf of death
The English lesson began with the hearing of the history
Royalpersons favourites intriguers bishops passed like mute phantomsbehind their veil of names
All had died all had been judged
What didit profit man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul
At last hehad understood and human life lay around him plain of peace whereonantlike men laboured in brotherhood their dead sleeping under quietmounds
The elbow of his companion touched him and his heart wastouched and when he spoke to answer question of his master he heardhis own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition
His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace no longer ableto suffer the pain of dread and sending forth as he sank faintprayer
Ah yes he would still be spared he would repent in his heartand be forgiven and then those above those in heaven would see whathe would do to make up for the past whole life every hour of life
Only wait
All God
All all
messenger came to the door to say that confessions were being heardin the chapel
Four boys left the room and he heard others passingdown the corridor
tremulous chill blew round his heart no strongerthan little wind and yet listening and suffering silently heseemed to have laid an ear against the muscle of his own heart feelingit close and quail listening to the flutter of its ventricles
No escape
He had to confess to speak out in words what he had doneand thought sin after sin
The thought slid like cold shining rapier into his tender fleshconfession
But not there in the chapel of the college
He wouldconfess all every sin of deed and thought sincerely but not thereamong his school companions
Far away from there in some dark place hewould murmur out his own shame and he besought God humbly not to beoffended with him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapeland in utter abjection of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of theboyish hearts about him
Time passed
He sat again in the front bench of the chapel
The daylight without wasalready failing and as it fell slowly through the dull red blinds itseemed that the sun of the last day was going down and that all soulswere being gathered for the judgement
am cast away from the sight of Thine eyes words taken my dearlittle brothers in Christ from the Book of Psalms thirtieth chaptertwentythird verse
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of theHoly Ghost
The preacher began to speak in quiet friendly tone
His face was kindand he joined gently the fingers of each hand forming frail cage bythe union of their tips
This morning we endeavoured in our reflection upon hell to make whatour holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises thecomposition of place
We endeavoured that is to imagine with thesenses of the mind in our imagination the material character of thatawful place and of the physical torments which all who are in hellendure
This evening we shall consider for few moments the nature ofthe spiritual torments of hell
Sin remember is twofold enormity
It is base consent to thepromptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts to that whichis gross and beastlike and it is also turning away from the counselof our higher nature from all that is pure and holy from the Holy GodHimself
For this reason mortal sin is punished in hell by twodifferent forms of punishment physical and spiritual
Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain ofloss so great in fact that in itself it is torment greater thanall the others
Saint Thomas the greatest doctor of the church theangelic doctor as he is called says that the worst damnation consistsin this that the understanding of man is totally deprived of divinelight and his affection obstinately turned away from the goodness ofGod
God remember is being infinitely good and therefore the lossof such being must be loss infinitely painful
In this life we havenot very clear idea of what such loss must be but the damned inhell for their greater torment have full understanding of thatwhich they have lost and understand that they have lost it throughtheir own sins and have lost it for ever
At the very instant of deaththe bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and the soul at once fliestowards God as towards the centre of her existence
Remember my dearlittle boys our souls long to be with God
We come from God we liveby God we belong to God we are His inalienably His
God loves with adivine love every human soul and every human soul lives in that love
How could it be otherwise
Every breath that we draw every thought ofour brain every instant of life proceeds from Gods inexhaustiblegoodness
And if it be pain for mother to be parted from her childfor man to be exiled from hearth and home for friend to be sunderedfrom friend think what pain what anguish it must be for the poorsoul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely good and lovingCreator Who has called that soul into existence from nothingness andsustained it in life and loved it with an immeasurable love
Thisthen to be separated for ever from its greatest good from God and tofeel the anguish of that separation knowing full well that it isunchangeable this is the greatest torment which the created soul iscapable of bearing pœna damni the pain of loss
The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in hell isthe pain of conscience
Just as in dead bodies worms are engendered byputrefaction so in the souls of the lost there arises perpetualremorse from the putrefaction of sin the sting of conscience theworm as Pope Innocent the Third calls it of the triple sting
Thefirst sting inflicted by this cruel worm will be the memory of pastpleasures
what dreadful memory will that be
In the lake ofalldevouring flame the proud king will remember the pomps of his courtthe wise but wicked man his libraries and instruments of research thelover of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other arttreasures he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeousfeasts his dishes prepared with such delicacy his choice wines themiser will remember his hoard of gold the robber his illgotten wealththe angry and revengeful and merciless murderers their deeds of bloodand violence in which they revelled the impure and adulterous theunspeakable and filthy pleasures in which they delighted
They willremember all this and loathe themselves and their sins
For howmiserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned to sufferin hellfire for ages and ages
How they will rage and fume to thinkthat they have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth for afew pieces of metal for vain honours for bodily comforts for atingling of the nerves
They will repent indeed and this is the secondsting of the worm of conscience late and fruitless sorrow for sinscommitted
Divine justice insists that the understanding of thosemiserable wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which they wereguilty and moreover as saint Augustine points out God will impart tothem His own knowledge of sin so that sin will appear to them in allits hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself
They willbehold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will be toolate and then they will bewail the good occasions which they neglected
This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm ofconscience
The conscience will say You had time and opportunity torepent and would not
You were brought up religiously by your parents
You had the sacraments and grace and indulgences of the church to aidyou
You had the minister of God to preach to you to call you backwhen you had strayed to forgive you your sins no matter how many howabominable if only you had confessed and repented
You would not
You flouted the ministers of holy religion you turned your back on theconfessional you wallowed deeper and deeper in the mire of sin
Godappealed to you threatened you entreated you to return to Him
Owhat shame what misery
The Ruler of the universe entreated you acreature of clay to love Him Who made you and to keep His law
Youwould not
And now though you were to flood all hell with your tearsif you could still weep all that sea of repentance would not gain foryou what single tear of true repentance shed during your mortal lifewould have gained for you
You implore now moment of earthly lifewherein to repent in vain
That time is gone gone for ever
Such is the threefold sting of conscience the viper which gnaws thevery hearts core of the wretches in hell so that filled with hellishfury they curse themselves for their folly and curse the evilcompanions who have brought them to such ruin and curse the devils whotempted them in life and now mock them in eternity and even revile andcurse the Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned andslighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade
The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is the painof extension
Man in this earthly life though he be capable of manyevils is not capable of them all at once inasmuch as one evilcorrects and counteracts another just as one poison frequently correctsanother
In hell on the contrary one torment instead ofcounteracting another lends it still greater force and moreover asthe internal faculties are more perfect than the external senses soare they more capable of suffering
Just as every sense is afflictedwith fitting torment so is every spiritual faculty the fancy withhorrible images the sensitive faculty with alternate longing and ragethe mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible eventhan the exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison
Themalice impotent though it be which possesses these demon souls is anevil of boundless extension of limitless duration frightful stateof wickedness which we can scarcely realise unless we bear in mind theenormity of sin and the hatred God bears to it
Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it we havethe pain of intensity
Hell is the centre of evils and as you knowthings are more intense at their centres than at their remotest points
There are no contraries or admixtures of any kind to temper or softenin the least the pains of hell
Nay things which are good inthemselves become evil in hell
Company elsewhere source of comfortto the afflicted will be there continual torment knowledge so muchlonged for as the chief good of the intellect will there be hatedworse than ignorance light so much coveted by all creatures from thelord of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest will beloathed intensely
In this life our sorrows are either not very long ornot very great because nature either overcomes them by habits or putsan end to them by sinking under their weight
But in hell the tormentscannot be overcome by habit for while they are of terrible intensitythey are at the same time of continual variety each pain so to speaktaking fire from another and reendowing that which has enkindled itwith still fiercer flame
Nor can nature escape from these intenseand various tortures by succumbing to them for the soul is sustainedand maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater
Boundless extension of torment incredible intensity of sufferingunceasing variety of torturethis is what the divine majesty sooutraged by sinners demands this is what the holiness of heavenslighted and set aside for the lustful and low pleasures of the corruptflesh requires this is what the blood of the innocent Lamb of Godshed for the redemption of sinners trampled upon by the vilest of thevile insists upon
Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful place isthe eternity of hell
dread and dire word
Whatmind of man can understand it
And remember it is an eternity of pain
Even though the pains of hell were not so terrible as they are yetthey would become infinite as they are destined to last for ever
Butwhile they are everlasting they are at the same time as you knowintolerably intense unbearably extensive
To bear even the sting of aninsect for all eternity would be dreadful torment
What must it bethen to bear the manifold tortures of hell for ever
For ever
For alleternity
Not for year or for an age but for ever
Try to imagine theawful meaning of this
You have often seen the sand on the seashore
How fine are its tiny grains
And how many of those tiny little grainsgo to make up the small handful which child grasps in its play
Nowimagine mountain of that sand million miles high reaching fromthe earth to the farthest heavens and million miles broad extendingto remotest space and million miles in thickness and imagine suchan enormous mass of countless particles of sand multiplied as often asthere are leaves in the forest drops of water in the mighty oceanfeathers on birds scales on fish hairs on animals atoms in the vastexpanse of the air and imagine that at the end of every million yearsa little bird came to that mountain and carried away in its beak tinygrain of that sand
How many millions upon millions of centuries wouldpass before that bird had carried away even square foot of thatmountain how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried awayall
Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time not even oneinstant of eternity could be said to have ended
At the end of allthose billions and trillions of years eternity would have scarcelybegun
And if that mountain rose again after it had been all carriedaway and if the bird came again and carried it all away again grain bygrain and if it so rose and sank as many times as there are stars inthe sky atoms in the air drops of water in the sea leaves on thetrees feathers upon birds scales upon fish hairs upon animals atthe end of all those innumerable risings and sinkings of thatimmeasurably vast mountain not one single instant of eternity could besaid to have ended even then at the end of such period after thateon of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain reeldizzily eternity would scarcely have begun
holy saint one of our own fathers believe it was was oncevouchsafed vision of hell
It seemed to him that he stood in themidst of great hall dark and silent save for the ticking of greatclock
The ticking went on unceasingly and it seemed to this saintthat the sound of the ticking was the ceaseless repetition of thewords ever never ever never
Ever to be in hell never to be inheaven ever to be shut off from the presence of God never to enjoythe beatific vision ever to be eaten with flames gnawed by vermingoaded with burning spikes never to be free from those pains ever tohave the conscience upbraid one the memory enrage the mind filledwith darkness and despair never to escape ever to curse and revilethe foul demons who gloat fiendishly over the misery of their dupesnever to behold the shining raiment of the blessed spirits ever to cryout of the abyss of fire to God for an instant single instant ofrespite from such awful agony never to receive even for an instantGods pardon ever to suffer never to enjoy ever to be damned neverto be saved ever never ever never
what dreadful punishment
An eternity of endless agony of endless bodily and spiritual tormentwithout one ray of hope without one moment of cessation of agonylimitless in intensity of torment infinitely varied of torture thatsustains eternally that which it eternally devours of anguish thateverlastingly preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh aneternity every instant of which is itself an eternity of woe
Such isthe terrible punishment decreed for those who die in mortal sin by analmighty and just God
Yes just God
Men reasoning always as men are astonished that Godshould mete out an everlasting and infinite punishment in the fires ofhell for single grievous sin
They reason thus because blinded bythe gross illusion of the flesh and the darkness of humanunderstanding they are unable to comprehend the hideous malice ofmortal sin
They reason thus because they are unable to comprehend thateven venial sin is of such foul and hideous nature that even if theomnipotent Creator could end all the evil and misery in the world thewars the diseases the robberies the crimes the deaths the murderson condition that he allowed single venial sin to pass unpunished asingle venial sin lie an angry look moment of wilful sloth Hethe great omnipotent God could not do so because sin be it in thoughtor deed is transgression of His law and God would not be God if Hedid not punish the transgressor
sin an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect made Luciferand third part of the cohort of angels fall from their glory
sinan instant of folly and weakness drove Adam and Eve out of Eden andbrought death and suffering into the world
To retrieve theconsequences of that sin the Only Begotten Son of God came down toearth lived and suffered and died most painful death hanging forthree hours on the cross
my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus will we then offend thatgood Redeemer and provoke His anger
Will we trample again upon thattorn and mangled corpse
Will we spit upon that face so full of sorrowand love
Will we too like the cruel jews and the brutal soldiersmock that gentle and compassionate Saviour Who trod alone for our sakethe awful winepress of sorrow
Every word of sin is wound in Histender side
Every sinful act is thorn piercing His head
Everyimpure thought deliberately yielded to is keen lance transfixingthat sacred and loving heart
No no
It is impossible for any humanbeing to do that which offends so deeply the divine Majesty that whichis punished by an eternity of agony that which crucifies again the Sonof God and makes mockery of Him
pray to God that my poor words may have availed today to confirm inholiness those who are in state of grace to strengthen the waveringto lead back to the state of grace the poor soul that has strayed ifany such be among you
pray to God and do you pray with me that wemay repent of our sins
will ask you now all of you to repeat afterme the act of contrition kneeling here in this humble chapel in thepresence of God
He is there in the tabernacle burning with love formankind ready to comfort the afflicted
Be not afraid
No matter howmany or how foul the sins if you only repent of them they will beforgiven you
Let no worldly shame hold you back
God is still themerciful Lord who wishes not the eternal death of the sinner but ratherthat he be converted and live
He calls you to Him
You are His
He made you out of nothing
He lovedyou as only God can love
His arms are open to receive you eventhough you have sinned against Him
Come to Him poor sinner poor vainand erring sinner
Now is the acceptable time
Now is the hour
The priest rose and turning towards the altar knelt upon the stepbefore the tabernacle in the fallen gloom
He waited till all in thechapel had knelt and every least noise was still
Then raising hishead he repeated the act of contrition phrase by phrase withfervour
The boys answered him phrase by phrase
Stephen his tonguecleaving to his palate bowed his head praying with his heart
my God my God am heartily sorry am heartily sorry for having offended Thee for having offended Thee and detest my sins and detest my sins above every other evil above every other evil because they displease Thee my God because they displease Thee my God Who art so deserving Who art so deserving of all my love of all my love and firmly purpose and firmly purpose by Thy holy grace by Thy holy grace never more to offend Thee never more to offend Thee and to amend my life and to amend my lifeHe went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone with his souland at every step his soul seemed to sigh at every step his soulmounted with his feet sighing in the ascent through region ofviscid gloom
He halted on the landing before the door and then grasping theporcelain knob opened the door quickly
He waited in fear his soulpining within him praying silently that death might not touch his browas he passed over the threshold that the fiends that inhabit darknessmight not be given power over him
He waited still at the threshold asat the entrance to some dark cave
Faces were there eyes they waitedand watched
We knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound to come tothe light he would find considerable difficulty in endeavouring to tryto induce himself to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritualplenipotentiary and so we knew of course perfectly wellMurmuring faces waited and watched murmurous voices filled the darkshell of the cave
He feared intensely in spirit and in flesh butraising his head bravely he strode into the room firmly
doorway aroom the same room same window
He told himself calmly that thosewords had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously fromthe dark
He told himself that it was simply his room with the dooropen
He closed the door and walking swiftly to the bed knelt beside it andcovered his face with his hands
His hands were cold and damp and hislimbs ached with chill
Bodily unrest and chill and weariness besethim routing his thoughts
Why was he kneeling there like childsaying his evening prayers
To be alone with his soul to examine hisconscience to meet his sins face to face to recall their times andmanners and circumstances to weep over them
He could not weep
Hecould not summon them to his memory
He felt only an ache of soul andbody his whole being memory will understanding flesh benumbed andweary
That was the work of devils to scatter his thoughts and overcloud hisconscience assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and sincorruptedflesh and praying God timidly to forgive him his weakness he crawledup on to the bed and wrapping the blankets closely about him coveredhis face again with his hands
He had sinned
He had sinned so deeplyagainst heaven and before God that he was not worthy to be called Godschild
Could it be that he Stephen Dedalus had done those things
Hisconscience sighed in answer
Yes he had done them secretly filthilytime after time and hardened in sinful impenitence he had dared towear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself while his soulwithin was living mass of corruption
How came it that God had notstruck him dead
The leprous company of his sins closed about himbreathing upon him bending over him from all sides
He strove toforget them in an act of prayer huddling his limbs closer together andbinding down his eyelids but the senses of his soul would not be boundand though his eyes were shut fast he saw the places where he hadsinned and though his ears were tightly covered he heard
He desiredwith all his will not to hear or see
He desired till his frame shookunder the strain of his desire and until the senses of his soul closed
They closed for an instant and then opened
He saw
field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettlebunches
Thickamong the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clotsand coils of solid excrement
faint marshlight struggling upwardsfrom all the ordure through the bristling greygreen weeds
An evilsmell faint and foul as the light curled upwards sluggishly out ofthe canisters and from the stale crusted dung
Creatures were in the field one three six creatures were moving inthe field hither and thither
Goatish creatures with human faceshornybrowed lightly bearded and grey as indiarubber
The malice ofevil glittered in their hard eyes as they moved hither and thithertrailing their long tails behind them
rictus of cruel malignity litup greyly their old bony faces
One was clasping about his ribs tornflannel waistcoat another complained monotonously as his beard stuckin the tufted weeds
Soft language issued from their spittleless lipsas they swished in slow circles round and round the field windinghither and thither through the weeds dragging their long tails amidthe rattling canisters
They moved in slow circles circling closer andcloser to enclose to enclose soft language issuing from their lipstheir long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite thrusting upwardstheir terrific facesHelp
He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck
Thatwas his hell
God had allowed him to see the hell reserved for hissins stinking bestial malignant hell of lecherous goatish fiends
For him
For him
He sprang from the bed the reeking odour pouring down his throatclogging and revolting his entrails
The air of heaven
Hestumbled towards the window groaning and almost fainting withsickness
At the washstand convulsion seized him within andclasping his cold forehead wildly he vomited profusely in agony
When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window andlifting the sash sat in corner of the embrasure and leaned his elbowupon the sill
The rain had drawn off and amid the moving vapours frompoint to point of light the city was spinning about herself softcocoon of yellowish haze
Heaven was still and faintly luminous and theair sweet to breathe as in thicket drenched with showers and amidpeace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made covenant withhis heart
He prayedHe once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory but we sinnedand then He could not safely visit us but with shrouded majesty and abedimmed radiance for He was God
So He came Himself in weakness not inpower and He sent thee creature in His stead with creaturescomeliness and lustre suited to our state
And now thy very face andform dear mother speak to us of the Eternal not like earthly beautydangerous to look upon but like the morning star which is thy emblembright and musical breathing purity telling of heaven and infusingpeace
harbringer of day
light of the pilgrim
Lead us still asthou hast led
In the dark night across the bleak wilderness guide uson to our Lord Jesus guide us homeHis eyes were dimmed with tears and looking humbly up to heaven hewept for the innocence he had lost
When evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch of thedamp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed behind him madeache again his conscience lulled by prayer and tears
It was not enough to lull the conscience with tear and aprayer
He had to kneel before the minister of the Holy Ghost and tellover his hidden sins truly and repentantly
Before he heard again thefootboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as it opened to lethim in before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper hewould have knelt and confessed
It was quite simple
The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly through thedark streets
There were so many flagstones on the footpath of thatstreet and so many streets in that city and so many cities in theworld
Yet eternity had no end
He was in mortal sin
Even once was amortal sin
It could happen in an instant
But how so quickly
Byseeing or by thinking of seeing
The eyes see the thing without havingwished first to see
Then in an instant it happens
But does that partof the body understand or what
The serpent the most subtle beast ofthe field
It must understand when it desires in one instant and thenprolongs its own desire instant after instant sinfully
It feels andunderstands and desires
What horrible thing
Who made it to be likethat bestial part of the body able to understand bestially anddesire bestially
Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by lowersoul
His soul sickened at the thought of torpid snaky life feedingitself out of the tender marrow of his life and fattening upon theslime of lust
why was that so
He cowered in the shadow of the thought abasing himself in the awe ofGod Who had made all things and all men
Who could think sucha thought
And cowering in darkness and abject he prayed mutely tohis guardian angel to drive away with his sword the demon that waswhispering to his brain
The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own soul hadsinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through his own body
He had to confess every sin
How could he utter in words tothe priest what he had done
Must must
Or how could he explainwithout dying of shame
Or how could he have done such things withoutshame
he would indeed to be free and sinlessagain
Perhaps the priest would know
dear God
He walked on and on through illlit streets fearing to stand still fora moment lest it might seem that he held back from what awaited himfearing to arrive at that towards which he still turned with longing
How beautiful must be soul in the state of grace when God looked uponit with love
Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets
Their dankhair hung trailed over their brows
They were not beautiful to see asthey crouched in the mire
But their souls were seen by God and iftheir souls were in state of grace they were radiant to see and Godloved them seeing them
wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think ofhow he had fallen to feel that those souls were dearer to God thanhis
The wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads ofother souls on whom Gods favour shone now more and now less stars nowbrighter and now dimmer sustained and failing
And the glimmeringsouls passed away sustained and failing merged in moving breath
One soul was lost tiny soul his
It flickered once and went outforgotten lost
The end black cold void waste
Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over vast tractof time unlit unfelt unlived
The squalid scene composed itselfaround him the common accents the burning gasjets in the shopsodours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust moving men and women
Anold woman was about to cross the street an oilcan in her hand
He bentdown and asked her was there chapel near
chapel sir
Yes sir
Church Street chapel
She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him and as sheheld out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe of shawl hebent lower towards her saddened and soothed by her voice
Thank you
You are quite welcome sir
The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the fragranceof incense still floated down the dim nave
Bearded workmen with piousfaces were guiding canopy out through side door the sacristanaiding them with quiet gestures and words
few of the faithful stilllingered praying before one of the sidealtars or kneeling in thebenches near the confessionals
He approached timidly and knelt at thelast bench in the body thankful for the peace and silence and fragrantshadow of the church
The board on which he knelt was narrow and wornand those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus
Jesus toohad been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of carpentercutting boards and planing them and had first spoken of the kingdom ofGod to poor fishermen teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart
He bowed his head upon his hands bidding his heart be meek and humblethat he might be like those who knelt beside him and his prayer asacceptable as theirs
He prayed beside them but it was hard
His soulwas foul with sin and he dared not ask forgiveness with the simpletrust of those whom Jesus in the mysterious ways of God had calledfirst to His side the carpenters the fishermen poor and simplepeople following lowly trade handling and shaping the wood of treesmending their nets with patience
tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred and at thelast moment glancing up swiftly he saw long grey beard and thebrown habit of capuchin
The priest entered the box and was hidden
Two penitents rose and entered the confessional at either side
Thewooden slide was drawn back and the faint murmur of voice troubledthe silence
His blood began to murmur in his veins murmuring like sinful citysummoned from its sleep to hear its doom
Little flakes of fire felland powdery ashes fell softly alighting on the houses of men
Theystirred waking from sleep troubled by the heated air
The slide was shot back
The penitent emerged from the side of the box
The farther side was drawn
woman entered quietly and deftly wherethe first penitent had knelt
The faint murmur began again
He could still leave the chapel
He could stand up put one foot beforethe other and walk out softly and then run run run swiftly throughthe dark streets
He could still escape from the shame
Had it been anyterrible crime but that one sin
Had it been murder
Little fieryflakes fell and touched him at all points shameful thoughts shamefulwords shameful acts
Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashesfalling continually
To say it in words
His soul stifling andhelpless would cease to be
The slide was shot back
penitent emerged from the farther side ofthe box
The near slide was drawn
penitent entered where the otherpenitent had come out
soft whispering noise floated in vaporouscloudlets out of the box
It was the woman soft whispering cloudletssoft whispering vapour whispering and vanishing
He beat his breast with his fist humbly secretly under cover of thewooden armrest
He would be at one with others and with God
He wouldlove his neighbour
He would love God who had made and loved him
Hewould kneel and pray with others and be happy
God would look down onhim and on them and would love them all
It was easy to be good
Gods yoke was sweet and light
It was betternever to have sinned to have remained always child for God lovedlittle children and suffered them to come to Him
It was terrible anda sad thing to sin
But God was merciful to poor sinners who were trulysorry
How true that was
That was indeed goodness
The slide was shot to suddenly
The penitent came out
He was next
Hestood up in terror and walked blindly into the box
At last it had come
He knelt in the silent gloom and raised his eyesto the white crucifix suspended above him
God could see that he wassorry
He would tell all his sins
His confession would be long long
Everybody in the chapel would know then what sinner he had been
Letthem know
It was true
But God had promised to forgive him if he wassorry
He was sorry
He clasped his hands and raised them towards thewhite form praying with his darkened eyes praying with all histrembling body swaying his head to and fro like lost creaturepraying with whimpering lips
The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast
The face ofan old priest was at the grating averted from him leaning upon ahand
He made the sign of the cross and prayed of the priest to blesshim for he had sinned
Then bowing his head he repeated theConfiteor in fright
At the words my most grievous fault he ceasedbreathless
How long is it since your last confession my child
long time father
month my child
Longer father
Three months my child
Longer father
Six months
Eight months father
He had begun
The priest askedAnd what do you remember since that time
He began to confess his sins masses missed prayers not said lies
Anything else my child
Sins of anger envy of others gluttony vanity disobedience
Anything else my child
There was no help
He murmuredI committed sins of impurity father
The priest did not turn his head
With yourself my child
And with others
With women my child
Yes father
Were they married women my child
He did not know
His sins trickled from his lips one by one trickledin shameful drops from his soul festering and oozing like sore asqualid stream of vice
The last sins oozed forth sluggish filthy
There was no more to tell
He bowed his head overcome
The priest was silent
Then he askedHow old are you my child
Sixteen father
The priest passed his hand several times over his face
Then restinghis forehead against his hand he leaned towards the grating and witheyes still averted spoke slowly
His voice was weary and old
You are very young my child he said and let me implore of you togive up that sin
It is terrible sin
It kills the body and it killsthe soul
It is the cause of many crimes and misfortunes
Give it upmy child for Gods sake
It is dishonourable and unmanly
You cannotknow where that wretched habit will lead you or where it will comeagainst you
As long as you commit that sin my poor child you willnever be worth one farthing to God
Pray to our mother Mary to helpyou
She will help you my child
Pray to Our Blessed Lady when thatsin comes into your mind
am sure you will do that will you not
Yourepent of all those sins
am sure you do
And you will promise Godnow that by His holy grace you will never offend Him any more by thatwicked sin
You will make that solemn promise to God will you not
Yes father
The old and weary voice fell like sweet rain upon his quaking parchingheart
How sweet and sad
Do so my poor child
The devil has led you astray
Drive him back tohell when he tempts you to dishonour your body in that waythe foulspirit who hates Our Lord
Promise God now that you will give up thatsin that wretched wretched sin
Blinded by his tears and by the light of Gods mercifulness he bent hishead and heard the grave words of absolution spoken and saw thepriests hand raised above him in token of forgiveness
God bless you my child
Pray for me
He knelt to say his penance praying in corner of the dark nave andhis prayers ascended to heaven from his purified heart like perfumestreaming upwards from heart of white rose
The muddy streets were gay
He strode homeward conscious of aninvisible grace pervading and making light his limbs
In spite of allhe had done it
He had confessed and God had pardoned him
His soul wasmade fair and holy once more holy and happy
It would be beautiful to die if God so willed
It was beautiful to livein grace life of peace and virtue and forbearance with others
He sat by the fire in the kitchen not daring to speak for happiness
Till that moment he had not known how beautiful and peaceful life couldbe
The green square of paper pinned round the lamp cast down tendershade
On the dresser was plate of sausages and white pudding and onthe shelf there were eggs
They would be for the breakfast in themorning after the communion in the college chapel
White pudding andeggs and sausages and cups of tea
How simple and beautiful was lifeafter all
And life lay all before him
In dream he fell asleep
In dream he rose and saw that it wasmorning
In waking dream he went through the quiet morning towardsthe college
The boys were all there kneeling in their places
He knelt among themhappy and shy
The altar was heaped with fragrant masses of whiteflowers and in the morning light the pale flames of the candles amongthe white flowers were clear and silent as his own soul
He knelt before the altar with his classmates holding the altar clothwith them over living rail of hands
His hands were trembling and hissoul trembled as he heard the priest pass with the ciborium fromcommunicant to communicant
Corpus Domini nostri
Could it be
He knelt there sinless and timid and he would hold uponhis tongue the host and God would enter his purified body
In vitam eternam
AmenAnother life
life of grace and virtue and happiness
It was true
Itwas not dream from which he would wake
The past was past
Corpus Domini nostri
The ciborium had come to him
Chapter IVSunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy Trinity Monday to theHoly Ghost Tuesday to the Guardian Angels Wednesday to Saint JosephThursday to the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar Friday to theSuffering Jesus Saturday to the Blessed Virgin Mary
Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of some holyimage or mystery
His day began with an heroic offering of its everymoment of thought or action for the intentions of the sovereign pontiffand with an early mass
The raw morning air whetted his resolute pietyand often as he knelt among the few worshippers at the sidealtarfollowing with his interleaved prayerbook the murmur of the priest heglanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in thegloom between the two candles which were the old and the newtestaments and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the catacombs
His daily life was laid out in devotional areas
By means ofejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the souls inpurgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years yet thespiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so many fabulousages of canonical penances did not wholly reward his zeal of prayersince he could never know how much temporal punishment he had remittedby way of suffrage for the agonising souls and fearful lest in themidst of the purgatorial fire which differed from the infernal only inthat it was not everlasting his penance might avail no more than adrop of moisture he drove his soul daily through an increasing circleof works of supererogation
Every part of his day divided by what he regarded now as the duties ofhis station in life circled about its own centre of spiritual energy
His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity every thought word anddeed every instance of consciousness could be made to revibrateradiantly in heaven and at times his sense of such immediaterepercussion was so lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotionpressing like fingers the keyboard of great cash register and to seethe amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven not as anumber but as frail column of incense or as slender flower
The rosaries too which he said constantlyfor he carried his beadsloose in his trousers pockets that he might tell them as he walked thestreetstransformed themselves into coronals of flowers of such vagueunearthly texture that they seemed to him as hueless and odourless asthey were nameless
He offered up each of his three daily chaplets thathis soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues infaith in the Father Who had created him in hope in the Son Who hadredeemed him and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanctified him andthis thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three Persons through Maryin the name of her joyful and sorrowful and glorious mysteries
On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that one of theseven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon his soul and drive outof it day by day the seven deadly sins which had defiled it in thepast and he prayed for each gift on its appointed day confident thatit would descend upon him though it seemed strange to him at timesthat wisdom and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in theirnature that each should be prayed for apart from the others
Yet hebelieved that at some future stage of his spiritual progress thisdifficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been raised upfrom its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person of the MostBlessed Trinity
He believed this all the more and with trepidationbecause of the divine gloom and silence wherein dwelt the unseenParaclete Whose symbols were dove and mighty wind to sin againstWhom was sin beyond forgiveness the eternal mysterious secret Beingto Whom as God the priests offered up mass once year robed in thescarlet of the tongues of fire
The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the Three Personsof the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the books of devotionwhich he readthe Father contemplating from all eternity as in mirrorHis Divine Perfections and thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Sonand the Holy Spirit proceeding out of Father and Son from alleternitywere easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of theiraugust incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had lovedhis soul from all eternity for ages before he had been born into theworld for ages before the world itself had existed
He had heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronouncedsolemnly on the stage and in the pulpit had found them set forthsolemnly in books and had wondered why his soul was unable to harbourthem for any time or to force his lips to utter their names withconviction
brief anger had often invested him but he had never beenable to make it an abiding passion and had always felt himself passingout of it as if his very body were being divested with ease of someouter skin or peel
He had felt subtle dark and murmurous presencepenetrate his being and fire him with brief iniquitous lust it toohad slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent
This it seemed was the only love and that the only hate his soulwould harbour
But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love since Godhimself had loved his individual soul with divine love from alleternity
Gradually as his soul was enriched with spiritual knowledgehe saw the whole world forming one vast symmetrical expression of Godspower and love
Life became divine gift for every moment andsensation of which were it even the sight of single leaf hanging onthe twig of tree his soul should praise and thank the Giver
Theworld for all its solid substance and complexity no longer existed forhis soul save as theorem of divine power and love and universality
So entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning inall nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand why itwas in any way necessary that he should continue to live
Yet that waspart of the divine purpose and he dared not question its use he aboveall others who had sinned so deeply and so foully against the divinepurpose
Meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternalomnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden ofpieties masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications and onlythen for the first time since he had brooded on the great mystery oflove did he feel within him warm movement like that of some newlyborn life or virtue of the soul itself
The attitude of rapture insacred art the raised and parted hands the parted lips and eyes as ofone about to swoon became for him an image of the soul in prayerhumiliated and faint before her Creator
But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exaltation anddid not allow himself to desist from even the least or lowliestdevotion striving also by constant mortification to undo the sinfulpast rather than to achieve saintliness fraught with peril
Each ofhis senses was brought under rigorous discipline
In order to mortifythe sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the street withdowncast eyes glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him
His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women
From time totime also he balked them by sudden effort of the will as by liftingthem suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing thebook
To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his voice whichwas then breaking neither sang nor whistled and made no attempt toflee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation such asthe sharpening of knives on the knifeboard the gathering of cinders onthe fireshovel and the twigging of the carpet
To mortify his smell wasmore difficult as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to badodours whether they were the odours of the outdoor world such as thoseof dung or tar or the odours of his own person among which he had mademany curious comparisons and experiments
He found in the end that theonly odour against which his sense of smell revolted was certainstale fishy stink like that of longstanding urine and whenever it waspossible he subjected himself to this unpleasant odour
To mortify thetaste he practised strict habits at table observed to the letter allthe fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mindfrom the savours of different foods
But it was to the mortification oftouch he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness
Henever consciously changed his position in bed sat in the mostuncomfortable positions suffered patiently every itch and pain keptaway from the fire remained on his knees all through the mass exceptat the gospels left part of his neck and face undried so that airmight sting them and whenever he was not saying his beads carried hisarms stiffly at his sides like runner and never in his pockets orclasped behind him
He had no temptations to sin mortally
It surprised him however to findthat at the end of his course of intricate piety and selfrestraint hewas so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfections
Hisprayers and fasts availed him little for the suppression of anger athearing his mother sneeze or at being disturbed in his devotions
Itneeded an immense effort of his will to master the impulse which urgedhim to give outlet to such irritation
Images of the outbursts oftrivial anger which he had often noted among his masters theirtwitching mouths closeshut lips and flushed cheeks recurred to hismemory discouraging him for all his practice of humility by thecomparison
To merge his life in the common tide of other lives washarder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constantfailure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul atlast sensation of spiritual dryness together with growth of doubtsand scruples
His soul traversed period of desolation in which thesacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried up sources
Hisconfession became channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepentedimperfections
His actual reception of the eucharist did not bring himthe same dissolving moments of virginal selfsurrender as did thosespiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visitto the Blessed Sacrament
The book which he used for these visits wasan old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori with fadingcharacters and sere foxpapered leaves
faded world of fervent loveand virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the readingof its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven withthe communicants prayers
An inaudible voice seemed to caress thesoul telling her names and glories bidding her arise as for espousaland come away bidding her look forth spouse from Amana and fromthe mountains of the leopards and the soul seemed to answer with thesame inaudible voice surrendering herself Inter ubera meacommorabiturThis idea of surrender had perilous attraction for his mind now thathe felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices of the fleshwhich began to murmur to him again during his prayers and meditations
It gave him an intense sense of power to know that he could by asingle act of consent in moment of thought undo all that he haddone
He seemed to feel flood slowly advancing towards his naked feetand to be waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touchhis fevered skin
Then almost at the instant of that touch almost atthe verge of sinful consent he found himself standing far away fromthe flood upon dry shore saved by sudden act of the will or asudden ejaculation and seeing the silver line of the flood far awayand beginning again its slow advance towards his feet new thrill ofpower and satisfaction shook his soul to know that he had not yieldednor undone all
When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in this way hegrew troubled and wondered whether the grace which he had refused tolose was not being filched from him little by little
The clearcertitude of his own immunity grew dim and to it succeeded vague fearthat his soul had really fallen unawares
It was with difficulty thathe won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by tellinghimself that he had prayed to God at every temptation and that thegrace which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch asGod was obliged to give it
The very frequency and violence oftemptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard about thetrials of the saints
Frequent and violent temptations were proofthat the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that the devil raged tomake it fall
Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples some momentaryinattention at prayer movement of trivial anger in his soul or asubtle wilfulness in speech or act he was bidden by his confessor toname some sin of his past life before absolution was given him
Henamed it with humility and shame and repented of it once more
Ithumiliated and shamed him to think that he would never be freed from itwholly however holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfectionshe might attain
restless feeling of guilt would always be presentwith him he would confess and repent and be absolved confess andrepent again and be absolved again fruitlessly
Perhaps that firsthasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had not been good
Perhaps concerned only for his imminent doom he had not had sinceresorrow for his sin
But the surest sign that his confession had beengood and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was he knew theamendment of his life
have amended my life have not
he asked himself
The director stood in the embrasure of the window his back to thelight leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind and as he spoke andsmiled slowly dangling and looping the cord of the other blindStephen stood before him following for moment with his eyes thewaning of the long summer daylight above the roofs or the slow deftmovements of the priestly fingers
The priests face was in totalshadow but the waning daylight from behind him touched the deeplygrooved temples and the curves of the skull
Stephen followed also withhis ears the accents and intervals of the priests voice as he spokegravely and cordially of indifferent themes the vacation which hadjust ended the colleges of the order abroad the transference ofmasters
The grave and cordial voice went on easily with its tale andin the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on again with respectfulquestions
He knew that the tale was prelude and his mind waited forthe sequel
Ever since the message of summons had come for him from thedirector his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the messageand during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlourwaiting for the director to come in his eyes had wandered from onesober picture to another around the walls and his mind wandered fromone guess to another until the meaning of the summons had almost becomeclear
Then just as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause mightprevent the director from coming he had heard the handle of the doorturning and the swish of soutane
The director had begun to speak of the Dominican and Franciscan ordersand of the friendship between saint Thomas and saint Bonaventure
TheCapuchin dress he thought was rather tooStephens face gave back the priests indulgent smile and not beinganxious to give an opinion he made slight dubitative movement withhis lips
believe continued the director that there is some talk now amongthe Capuchins themselves of doing away with it and following theexample of the other Franciscans
suppose they would retain it in the cloisters
said Stephen
certainly said the director
For the cloister it is all right butfor the street really think it would be better to do away with itdont you
It must be troublesome imagine
Of course it is of course
Just imagine when was in Belgium usedto see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with this thing upabout their knees
It was really ridiculous
Les jupes they callthem in Belgium
The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct
What do they call them
Les jupes
Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could not see onthe priests shadowed face its image or spectre only passing rapidlyacross his mind as the low discreet accent fell upon his ear
He gazedcalmly before him at the waning sky glad of the cool of the eveningand of the faint yellow glow which hid the tiny flame kindling upon hischeek
The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain soft anddelicate stuffs used in their making brought always to his mind adelicate and sinful perfume
As boy he had imagined the reins bywhich horses are driven as slender silken bands and it shocked him tofeel at Stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness
It had shocked himtoo when he had felt for the first time beneath his tremulous fingersthe brittle texture of womans stocking for retaining nothing of allhe read save that which seemed to him an echo or prophecy of his ownstate it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft stuffsthat he dared to conceive of the soul or body of woman moving withtender life
But the phrase on the priests lips was disingenuous for he knew that apriest should not speak lightly on that theme
The phrase had beenspoken lightly with design and he felt that his face was being searchedby the eyes in the shadow
Whatever he had heard or read of the craftof jesuits he had put aside frankly as not borne out by his ownexperience
His masters even when they had not attracted him hadseemed to him always intelligent and serious priests athletic andhighspirited prefects
He thought of them as men who washed theirbodies briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen
During allthe years he had lived among them in Clongowes and in Belvedere he hadreceived only two pandies and though these had been dealt him in thewrong he knew that he had often escaped punishment
During all thoseyears he had never heard from any of his masters flippant word itwas they who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live agood life and when he had fallen into grievous sin it was they whohad led him back to grace
Their presence had made him diffident ofhimself when he was muff in Clongowes and it had made him diffidentof himself also while he had held his equivocal position in Belvedere
constant sense of this had remained with him up to the last year ofhis school life
He had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulentcompanions to seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience and evenwhen he doubted some statement of master he had never presumed todoubt openly
Lately some of their judgements had sounded littlechildish in his ears and had made him feel regret and pity as thoughhe were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and were hearing itslanguage for the last time
One day when some boys had gathered round apriest under the shed near the chapel he had heard the priest sayI believe that Lord Macaulay was man who probably never committed amortal sin in his life that is to say deliberate mortal sin
Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo were not thegreatest French writer
The priest had answered that Victor Hugo hadnever written half so well when he had turned against the church as hehad written when he was catholic
But there are many eminent French critics said the priest whoconsider that even Victor Hugo great as he certainly was had not sopure French style as Louis Veuillot
The tiny flame which the priests allusion had kindled upon Stephenscheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still fixed calmly on thecolourless sky
But an unresting doubt flew hither and thither beforehis mind
Masked memories passed quickly before him he recognisedscenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to perceivesome vital circumstance in them
He saw himself walking about thegrounds watching the sports in Clongowes and eating slim jim out of hiscricketcap
Some jesuits were walking round the cycletrack in thecompany of ladies
The echoes of certain expressions used in Clongowessounded in remote caves of his mind
His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the silence of theparlour when he became aware that the priest was addressing him in adifferent voice
sent for you today Stephen because wished to speak to you on avery important subject
Yes sir
Have you ever felt that you had vocation
Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the wordsuddenly
The priest waited for the answer and addedI mean have you ever felt within yourself in your soul desire tojoin the order
have sometimes thought of it said Stephen
The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and uniting his handsleaned his chin gravely upon them communing with himself
In college like this he said at length there is one boy or perhapstwo or three boys whom God calls to the religious life
Such boy ismarked off from his companions by his piety by the good example heshows to others
He is looked up to by them he is chosen perhaps asprefect by his fellow sodalists
And you Stephen have been such boyin this college prefect of Our Blessed Ladys sodality
Perhaps youare the boy in this college whom God designs to call to Himself
strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priests voicemade Stephens heart quicken in response
To receive that call Stephen said the priest is the greatest honourthat the Almighty God can bestow upon man
No king or emperor on thisearth has the power of the priest of God
No angel or archangel inheaven no saint not even the Blessed Virgin herself has the power ofa priest of God the power of the keys the power to bind and to loosefrom sin the power of exorcism the power to cast out from thecreatures of God the evil spirits that have power over them the powerthe authority to make the great God of Heaven come down upon the altarand take the form of bread and wine
What an awful power Stephen
flame began to flutter again on Stephens cheek as he heard in thisproud address an echo of his own proud musings
How often had he seenhimself as priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power of whichangels and saints stood in reverence
His soul had loved to muse insecret on this desire
He had seen himself young and silentmanneredpriest entering confessional swiftly ascending the altarstepsincensing genuflecting accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthoodwhich pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of theirdistance from it
In that dim life which he had lived through in hismusings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted withvarious priests
He had bent his knee sideways like such one he hadshaken the thurible only slightly like such one his chasuble hadswung open like that of such another as he turned to the altar againafter having blessed the people
And above all it had pleased him tofill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining
He shrankfrom the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine thatall the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritualshould assign to him so clear and final an office
He longed for theminor sacred offices to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon athigh mass to stand aloof from the altar forgotten by the people hisshoulders covered with humeral veil holding the paten within itsfolds or when the sacrifice had been accomplished to stand as deaconin dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant hishands joined and his face towards the people and sing the chant Itemissa est If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was as in thepictures of the mass in his childs massbook in church withoutworshippers save for the angel of the sacrifice at bare altar andserved by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself
In vaguesacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forthto encounter reality and it was partly the absence of an appointedrite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he hadallowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only anembrace he longed to give
He listened in reverent silence now to the priests appeal and throughthe words he heard even more distinctly voice bidding him approachoffering him secret knowledge and secret power
He would know then whatwas the sin of Simon Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost forwhich there was no forgiveness
He would know obscure things hiddenfrom others from those who were conceived and born children of wrath
He would know the sins the sinful longings and sinful thoughts andsinful acts of others hearing them murmured into his ears in theconfessional under the shame of darkened chapel by the lips of womenand of girls but rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by theimposition of hands his soul would pass again uncontaminated to thewhite peace of the altar
No touch of sin would linger upon the handswith which he would elevate and break the host no touch of sin wouldlinger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink damnation tohimself not discerning the body of the Lord
He would hold his secretknowledge and secret power being as sinless as the innocent and hewould be priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec
will offer up my mass tomorrow morning said the director thatAlmighty God may reveal to you His holy will
And let you Stephenmake novena to your holy patron saint the first martyr who is verypowerful with God that God may enlighten your mind
But you must bequite sure Stephen that you have vocation because it would beterrible if you found afterwards that you had none
Once priestalways priest remember
Your catechism tells you that the sacramentof Holy Orders is one of those which can be received only once becauseit imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never beeffaced
It is before you must weigh well not after
It is solemnquestion Stephen because on it may depend the salvation of youreternal soul
But we will pray to God together
He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to acompanion in the spiritual life
Stephen passed out on to the wideplatform above the steps and was conscious of the caress of mildevening air
Towards Findlaters church quartet of young men werestriding along with linked arms swaying their heads and stepping tothe agile melody of their leaders concertina
The music passed in aninstant as the first bars of sudden music always did over thefantastic fabrics of his mind dissolving them painlessly andnoiselessly as sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets ofchildren
Smiling at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priestsface and seeing in it mirthless reflection of the sunken daydetached his hand slowly which had acquiesced faintly in thatcompanionship
As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his troubledselfcommunion was that of mirthless mask reflecting sunken day fromthe threshold of the college
The shadow then of the life of thecollege passed gravely over his consciousness
It was grave andordered and passionless life that awaited him life without materialcares
He wondered how he would pass the first night in the novitiateand with what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory
The troubling odour of the long corridors of Clongowes came back to himand he heard the discreet murmur of the burning gasflames
At once fromevery part of his being unrest began to irradiate
feverishquickening of his pulses followed and din of meaningless words drovehis reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly
His lungs dilatedand sank as if he were inhaling warm moist unsustaining air and hesmelt again the moist warm air which hung in the bath in Clongowesabove the sluggish turfcoloured water
Some instinct waking at these memories stronger than education orpiety quickened within him at every near approach to that life aninstinct subtle and hostile and armed him against acquiescence
Thechill and order of the life repelled him
He saw himself rising in thecold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass andtrying vainly to struggle with his prayers against the faintingsickness of his stomach
He saw himself sitting at dinner with thecommunity of college
What then had become of that deeprootedshyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under strangeroof
What had come of the pride of his spirit which had always madehim conceive himself as being apart in every order
The Reverend Stephen Dedalus
His name in that new life leaped into characters before his eyes and toit there followed mental sensation of an undefined face or colour ofa face
The colour faded and became strong like changing glow ofpallid brick red
Was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen onwintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests
The face waseyeless and sourfavoured and devout shot with pink tinges ofsuffocated anger
Was it not mental spectre of the face of one of thejesuits whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others FoxyCampbell
He was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in GardinerStreet and wondered vaguely which window would be his if he everjoined the order
Then he wondered at the vagueness of his wonder atthe remoteness of his own soul from what he had hitherto imagined hersanctuary at the frail hold which so many years of order and obediencehad of him when once definite and irrevocable act of his threatenedto end for ever in time and in eternity his freedom
The voice of thedirector urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mysteryand power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory
His soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that theexhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formaltale
He would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle aspriest
His destiny was to be elusive of social or religious orders
The wisdom of the priests appeal did not touch him to the quick
Hewas destined to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn thewisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world
The snares of the world were its ways of sin
He would fall
He had notyet fallen but he would fall silently in an instant
Not to fall wastoo hard too hard and he felt the silent lapse of his soul as itwould be at some instant to come falling falling but not yet fallenstill unfallen but about to fall
He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and turned his eyescoldly for an instant towards the faded blue shrine of the BlessedVirgin which stood fowlwise on pole in the middle of hamshapedencampment of poor cottages
Then bending to the left he followed thelane which led up to his house
The faint sour stink of rotted cabbagescame towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground abovethe river
He smiled to think that it was this disorder the misruleand confusion of his fathers house and the stagnation of vegetablelife which was to win the day in his soul
Then short laugh brokefrom his lips as he thought of that solitary farmhand in the kitchengardens behind their house whom they had nicknamed the man with thehat
second laugh taking rise from the first after pause brokefrom him involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hatworked considering in turn the four points of the sky and thenregretfully plunging his spade in the earth
He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed through thenaked hallway into the kitchen
group of his brothers and sisters wassitting round the table
Tea was nearly over and only the last of thesecond watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars andjampots which did service for teacups
Discarded crusts and lumps ofsugared bread turned brown by the tea which had been poured over themlay scattered on the table
Little wells of tea lay here and there onthe board and knife with broken ivory handle was stuck through thepith of ravaged turnover
The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through the windowand the open door covering over and allaying quietly sudden instinctof remorse in Stephens heart
All that had been denied them had beenfreely given to him the eldest but the quiet glow of evening showedhim in their faces no sign of rancour
He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and motherwere
One answeredGoneboro toboro lookboro atboro aboro houseboro
Still another removal
boy named Fallon in Belvedere had oftenasked him with silly laugh why they moved so often
frown of scorndarkened quickly his forehead as he heard again the silly laugh of thequestioner
He askedWhy are we on the move again if its fair question
Becauseboro theboro landboro lordboro willboro putboro usboro outboro
The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of thefireplace began to sing the air Oft in the Stilly Night
One by onethe others took up the air until full choir of voices was singing
They would sing so for hours melody after melody glee after gleetill the last pale light died down on the horizon till the first darknightclouds came forth and night fell
He waited for some moments listening before he too took up the airwith them
He was listening with pain of spirit to the overtone ofweariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices
Even before theyset out on lifes journey they seemed weary already of the way
He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and multipliedthrough an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless generationsof children and heard in all the echoes an echo also of the recurringnote of weariness and pain
All seemed weary of life even beforeentering upon it
And he remembered that Newman had heard this notealso in the broken lines of Virgil giving utterance like the voiceof Nature herself to that pain and weariness yet hope of better thingswhich has been the experience of her children in every timeHe could wait no longer
From the door of Byrons publichouse to the gate of Clontarf Chapelfrom the gate of Clontarf Chapel to the door of Byrons publichouseand then back again to the chapel and then back again to thepublichouse he had paced slowly at first planting his stepsscrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath thentiming their fall to the fall of verses
full hour had passed sincehis father had gone in with Dan Crosby the tutor to find out for himsomething about the university
For full hour he had paced up anddown waiting but he could wait no longer
He set off abruptly for the Bull walking rapidly lest his fathersshrill whistle might call him back and in few moments he had roundedthe curve at the police barrack and was safe
Yes his mother was hostile to the idea as he had read from herlistless silence
Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than hisfathers pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith whichwas fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes
dimantagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as cloudagainst her disloyalty and when it passed cloudlike leaving his mindserene and dutiful towards her again he was made aware dimly andwithout regret of first noiseless sundering of their lives
The university
So he had passed beyond the challenge of the sentrieswho had stood as guardians of his boyhood and had sought to keep himamong them that he might be subject to them and serve their ends
Prideafter satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
The end he hadbeen born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseenpath and now it beckoned to him once more and new adventure was aboutto be opened to him
It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitfulmusic leaping upwards tone and downwards diminished fourth upwardsa tone and downwards major third like triplebranching flamesleaping fitfully flame after flame out of midnight wood
It was anelfin prelude endless and formless and as it grew wilder and fasterthe flames leaping out of time he seemed to hear from under the boughsand grasses wild creatures racing their feet pattering like rain uponthe leaves
Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind thefeet of hares and rabbits the feet of harts and hinds and antelopesuntil he heard them no more and remembered only proud cadence fromNewmanWhose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlastingarms
The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of theoffice he had refused
All through his boyhood he had mused upon thatwhich he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment hadcome for him to obey the call he had turned aside obeying waywardinstinct
Now time lay between the oils of ordination would neveranoint his body
He had refused
He turned seaward from the road at Dollymount and as he passed on tothe thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp ofheavily shod feet
squad of Christian Brothers was on its way backfrom the Bull and had begun to pass two by two across the bridge
Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
The uncouth facespassed him two by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea andas he strove to look at them with ease and indifference faint stainof personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
Angry withhimself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing downsideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he stillsaw reflection therein of their topheavy silk hats and humbletapelike collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes
Brother Hickey
Brother Quaid
Brother MacArdle
Brother KeoghTheir piety would be like their names like their faces like theirclothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble andcontrite hearts it might be paid far richer tribute of devotionthan his had ever been gift tenfold more acceptable than hiselaborate adoration
It was idle for him to move himself to be generoustowards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gatesstripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would begenerous towards him loving him as themselves
Idle and embitteringfinally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that thecommandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves withthe same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves withthe same kind of love
He drew forth phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly tohimselfA day of dappled seaborne clouds
The phrase and the day and the scene harmonised in chord
Wasit their colours
He allowed them to glow and fade hue after huesunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchards azure of wavesthe greyfringed fleece of clouds
No it was not their colours it wasthe poise and balance of the period itself
Did he then love therhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations oflegend and colour
Or was it that being as weak of sight as he was shyof mind he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowingsensible world through the prism of language manycoloured and richlystoried than from the contemplation of an inner world of individualemotions mirrored perfectly in lucid supple periodic prose
He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again
At thatinstant as it seemed to him the air was chilled and looking askancetowards the water he saw flying squall darkening and crispingsuddenly the tide
faint click at his heart faint throb in histhroat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahumanodour of the sea yet he did not strike across the downs on his leftbut held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against therivers mouth
veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where theriver was embayed
In the distance along the course of the slowflowingLiffey slender masts flecked the sky and more distant still the dimfabric of the city lay prone in haze
Like scene on some vague arrasold as mans weariness the image of the seventh city of christendomwas visible to him across the timeless air no older nor more weary norless patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote
Disheartened he raised his eyes towards the slowdrifting cloudsdappled and seaborne
They were voyaging across the deserts of the skya host of nomads on the march voyaging high over Ireland westwardbound
The Europe they had come from lay out there beyond the IrishSea Europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt andcitadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races
He heard confusedmusic within him as of memories and names which he was almost consciousof but could not capture even for an instant then the music seemed torecede to recede to recede and from each receding trail of nebulousmusic there fell always one longdrawn calling note piercing like astar the dusk of silence
voice from beyond theworld was calling
Hello Stephanos
Here comes The Dedalus
Eh give it over Dwyer Im telling you or Ill give you astuff in the kisser for yourself Ao
Good man Towser
Duck him
Come along Dedalus

Duck him
Guzzle him now Towser
He recognised their speech collectively before he distinguished theirfaces
The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him tothe bone
Their bodies corpsewhite or suffused with pallid goldenlight or rawly tanned by the sun gleamed with the wet of the sea
Their divingstone poised on its rude supports and rocking under theirplunges and the roughhewn stones of the sloping breakwater over whichthey scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre
Thetowels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with coldseawater and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair
He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banterwith easy words
How characterless they looked Shuley without his deepunbuttoned collar Ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky claspand Connolly without his Norfolk coat with the flapless sidepockets
Itwas pain to see them and swordlike pain to see the signs ofadolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness
Perhaps theyhad taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in theirsouls
But he apart from them and in silence remembered in what dreadhe stood of the mystery of his own body

Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proudsovereignty
Now as never before his strange name seemed to him aprophecy
So timeless seemed the grey warm air so fluid and impersonalhis own mood that all ages were as one to him
moment before theghost of the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through thevesture of the hazewrapped city
Now at the name of the fabulousartificer he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see wingedform flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air
What did itmean
Was it quaint device opening page of some medieval book ofprophecies and symbols hawklike man flying sunward above the sea aprophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been followingthrough the mists of childhood and boyhood symbol of the artistforging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth anew soaring impalpable imperishable being
His heart trembled his breath came faster and wild spirit passedover his limbs as though he was soaring sunward
His heart trembled inan ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight
His soul was soaring inan air beyond the world and the body he knew was purified in breathand delivered of incertitude and made radiant and commingled with theelement of the spirit
An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes andwild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs
Look out
Cripes Im drownded
Three and away
The next
The next
His throat ached with desire to cry aloud the cry of hawk or eagleon high to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds
This wasthe call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world ofduties and despair not the inhuman voice that had called him to thepale service of the altar
An instant of wild flight had delivered himand the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain
What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of deaththe fearhe had walked in night and day the incertitude that had ringed himround the shame that had abased him within and withoutcerements thelinens of the grave
His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood spurning hergraveclothes
He would create proudly out of the freedomand power of his soul as the great artificer whose name he bore aliving thing new and soaring and beautiful impalpable imperishable
He started up nervously from the stoneblock for he could no longerquench the flame in his blood
He felt his cheeks aflame and his throatthrobbing with song
There was lust of wandering in his feet thatburned to set out for the ends of the earth
his heart seemedto cry
Evening would deepen above the sea night fall upon the plainsdawn glimmer before the wanderer and show him strange fields and hillsand faces
He looked northward towards Howth
The sea had fallen below the line ofseawrack on the shallow side of the breakwater and already the tide wasrunning out fast along the foreshore
Already one long oval bank ofsand lay warm and dry amid the wavelets
Here and there warm isles ofsand gleamed above the shallow tide and about the isles and around thelong bank and amid the shallow currents of the beach were lightcladfigures wading and delving
In few moments he was barefoot his stockings folded in his pocketsand his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shouldersand picking pointed salteaten stick out of the jetsam among therocks he clambered down the slope of the breakwater
There was long rivulet in the strand and as he waded slowly up itscourse he wondered at the endless drift of seaweed
Emerald and blackand russet and olive it moved beneath the current swaying andturning
The water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift andmirrored the highdrifting clouds
The clouds were drifting above himsilently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the greywarm air was still and new wild life was singing in his veins
Where was his boyhood now
Where was the soul that had hung back fromher destiny to brood alone upon the shame of her wounds and in herhouse of squalor and subterfuge to queen it in faded cerements and inwreaths that withered at the touch
Or where was he
He was alone
He was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart oflife
He was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted alone amid awaste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells andtangle and veiled grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures ofchildren and girls and voices childish and girlish in the air
girl stood before him in midstream alone and still gazing out tosea
She seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of astrange and beautiful seabird
Her long slender bare legs were delicateas cranes and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed hadfashioned itself as sign upon the flesh
Her thighs fuller andsofthued as ivory were bared almost to the hips where the whitefringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down
Herslateblue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailedbehind her
Her bosom was as birds soft and slight slight and softas the breast of some darkplumaged dove
But her long fair hair wasgirlish and girlish and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty herface
She was alone and still gazing out to sea and when she felt hispresence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quietsufferance of his gaze without shame or wantonness
Long long shesuffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bentthem towards the stream gently stirring the water with her foot hitherand thither
The first faint noise of gently moving water broke thesilence low and faint and whispering faint as the bells of sleephither and thither hither and thither and faint flame trembled onher cheek
Heavenly God
cried Stephens soul in an outburst of profane joy
He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand
Hischeeks were aflame his body was aglow his limbs were trembling
Onand on and on and on he strode far out over the sands singing wildlyto the sea crying to greet the advent of the life that had cried tohim
Her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had broken theholy silence of his ecstasy
Her eyes had called him and his soul hadleaped at the call
To live to err to fall to triumph to recreatelife out of life
wild angel had appeared to him the angel of mortalyouth and beauty an envoy from the fair courts of life to throw openbefore him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of errorand glory
On and on and on and on
He halted suddenly and heard his heart in the silence
How far had hewalked
What hour was it
There was no human figure near him nor any sound borne to him over theair
But the tide was near the turn and already the day was on thewane
He turned landward and ran towards the shore and running up thesloping beach reckless of the sharp shingle found sandy nook amid aring of tufted sandknolls and lay down there that the peace and silenceof the evening might still the riot of his blood
He felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes ofthe heavenly bodies and the earth beneath him the earth that hadborne him had taken him to her breast
He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep
His eyelids trembled as ifthey felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watcherstrembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world
His soulwas swooning into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as undersea traversed by cloudy shapes and beings
world glimmer or aflower
Glimmering and trembling trembling and unfolding breakinglight an opening flower it spread in endless succession to itselfbreaking in full crimson and unfolding and fading to palest rose leafby leaf and wave of light by wave of light flooding all the heavenswith its soft flushes every flush deeper than the other
Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of hisbed glowed no longer
He rose slowly and recalling the rapture of hissleep sighed at its joy
He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him
Eveninghad fallen
rim of the young moon cleft the pale waste of skylinethe rim of silver hoop embedded in grey sand and the tide wasflowing in fast to the land with low whisper of her waves islandinga few last figures in distant pools
Chapter VHe drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewingthe crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him staring intothe dark pool of the jar
The yellow dripping had been scooped out likea boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the darkturfcoloured water of the bath in Clongowes
The box of pawn tickets athis elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another inhis greasy fingers the blue and white dockets scrawled and sanded andcreased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy
Pair Buskins
Articles and White
Mans Pants
Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the boxspeckled with louse marks and asked vaguelyHow much is the clock fast now
His mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on itsside in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed quarterto twelve and then laid it once more on its side
An hour and twentyfive minutes she said
The right time now istwenty past ten
The dear knows you might try to be in time for yourlectures
Fill out the place for me to wash said Stephen
Katey fill out the place for Stephen to washBoody fill out the place for Stephen to washI cant Im going for blue
Fill it out you Maggy
When the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink andthe old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother toscrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into theinterstices at the wings of his nose
Well its poor case she said when university student is sodirty that his mother has to wash him
But it gives you pleasure said Stephen calmly
An earsplitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrusta damp overall into his hands sayingDry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness
second shrill whistle prolonged angrily brought one of the girls tothe foot of the staircase
Yes father
Is your lazy bitch of brother gone out yet
Yes father
Yes father
The girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go out quietlyby the back
Stephen laughed and saidHe has curious idea of genders if he thinks bitch is masculine
Ah its scandalous shame for you Stephen said his mother andyoull live to rue the day you set your foot in that place
know howit has changed you
Good morning everybody said Stephen smiling and kissing the tips ofhis fingers in adieu
The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down itslowly choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish he heard madnun screeching in the nuns madhouse beyond the wall
He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head andhurried on stumbling through the mouldering offal his heart alreadybitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness
His fathers whistle hismothers mutterings the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now somany voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth
He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration but ashe walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling abouthim through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of thewet leaves and bark his soul was loosed of her miseries
The rainladen trees of the avenue evoked in him as always memories ofthe girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann and the memoryof their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branchesmingled in mood of quiet joy
His morning walk across the city hadbegun and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview hewould think of the cloistral silverveined prose of Newman that as hewalked along the North Strand Road glancing idly at the windows of theprovision shops he would recall the dark humour of Guido Cavalcantiand smile that as he went by Bairds stonecutting works in TalbotPlace the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like keen wind aspirit of wayward boyish beauty and that passing grimy marinedealers shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonsonwhich begins was not wearier where lay
His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid thespectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas turned often for its pleasure tothe dainty songs of the Elizabethans
His mind in the vesture of adoubting monk stood often in shadow under the windows of that age tohear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughterof waistcoateers until laugh too low phrase tarnished by time ofchambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him onfrom his lurkingplace
The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so thatit had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only garner ofslender sentences from Aristotles poetics and psychology and aSynopsis Philosophiæ Scholasticæ ad mentem divi Thomæ
His thinkingwas dusk of doubt and selfmistrust lit up at moments by thelightnings of intuition but lightnings of so clear splendour that inthose moments the world perished about his feet as if it had beenfireconsumed and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyesof others with unanswering eyes for he felt that the spirit of beautyhad folded him round like mantle and that in reverie at least he hadbeen acquainted with nobility
But when this brief pride of silenceupheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst ofcommon lives passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and slothof the city fearlessly and with light heart
Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with thedolls face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope ofthe bridge with little steps tightly buttoned into his chocolateovercoat and holding his furled umbrella span or two from him like adivining rod
It must be eleven he thought and peered into dairy tosee the time
The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutesto five but as he turned away he heard clock somewhere near himbut unseen beating eleven strokes in swift precision
He laughed as heheard it for it made him think of McCann and he saw him squat figurein shooting jacket and breeches and with fair goatee standing inthe wind at Hopkins corner and heard him sayDedalus youre an antisocial being wrapped up in yourself
Im not
Im democrat and Ill work and act for social liberty and equalityamong all classes and sexes in the United States of the Europe of thefuture
Then he was late for that lecture too
What day of the week wasit
He stopped at newsagents to read the headline of placard
Ten to eleven English eleven to twelve French twelve toone physics
He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt evenat that distance restless and helpless
He saw the heads of hisclassmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points theywere bidden to note nominal definitions essential definitions andexamples or dates of birth or death chief works favourable and anunfavourable criticism side by side
His own head was unbent for histhoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little classof students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of thegreen an odour assailed him of cheerless cellardamp and decay
Anotherhead than his right before him in the first benches was poisedsquarely above its bending fellows like the head of priest appealingwithout humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers abouthim
Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raisebefore his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of thehead and face
Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he sawit before him like the phantom of dream the face of severed heador death mask crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair asby an iron crown
It was priestlike face priestlike in its pallorin the wide winged nose in the shadowings below the eyes and along thejaws priestlike in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintlysmiling and Stephen remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of allthe tumults and unrest and longings in his soul day after day andnight by night only to be answered by his friends listening silencewould have told himself that it was the face of guilty priest whoheard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that hefelt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes
Through this image he had glimpse of strange dark cavern ofspeculation but at once turned away from it feeling that it was notyet the hour to enter it
But the nightshade of his friendslistlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him tenuous anddeadly exhalation and he found himself glancing from one casual word toanother on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been sosilently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legendbound his mind like the words of spell and his soul shrivelled upsighing with age as he walked on in lane among heaps of deadlanguage
His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brainand trickling into the very words themselves which set to band anddisband themselves in wayward rhythms The ivy whines upon the wall And whines and twines upon the wall The yellow ivy upon the wall Ivy ivy up the wall
Did anyone ever hear such drivel
Lord Almighty
Who ever heard of ivywhining on wall
Yellow ivy that was all right
Yellow ivory also
And what about ivory ivy
The word now shone in his brain clearer and brighter than any ivorysawn from the mottled tusks of elephants
Ivory ivoire avorioebur One of the first examples that he had learnt in Latin had runIndia mittit ebur and he recalled the shrewd northern face of therector who had taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in acourtly English made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherdsand chines of bacon
He had learnt what little he knew of the laws ofLatin verse from ragged book written by Portuguese priest
Contrahit orator variant in carmine vates
The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were handed onto him in the trite words in tanto discrimine and he had tried topeer into the social life of the city of cities through the wordsimplere ollam denariorum which the rector had rendered sonorously asthe filling of pot with denaries
The pages of his timeworn Horacenever felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold theywere human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by thehuman fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother WilliamMalcolm Inverarity
Yes those were noble names on the dusky flyleafand even for so poor Latinist as he the dusky verses were asfragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavenderand vervain but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be buta shy guest at the feast of the worlds culture and that the monkishlearning in terms of which he was striving to forge out an estheticphilosophy was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtleand curious jargons of heraldry and falconry
The grey block of Trinity on his left set heavily in the citysignorance like dull stone set in cumbrous ring pulled his minddownward and while he was striving this way and that to free his feetfrom the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the drollstatue of the national poet of Ireland
He looked at it without anger for though sloth of the body and of thesoul crept over it like unseen vermin over the shuffling feet and upthe folds of the cloak and around the servile head it seemed humblyconscious of its indignity
It was Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of aMilesian and he thought of his friend Davin the peasant student
Itwas jesting name between them but the young peasant bore with itlightlyGo on Stevie have hard head you tell me
Call me what you will
The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend hadtouched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal inspeech with others as they were with him
Often as he sat in Davinsrooms in Grantham Street wondering at his friends wellmade bootsthat flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friendssimple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils ofhis own longing and dejection the rude Firbolg mind of his listenerhad drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again drawing it by aquiet inbred courtesy of attention or by quaint turn of old Englishspeech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skillfor Davinhad sat at the feet of Michael Cusack the Gaelrepelling swiftly andsuddenly by grossness of intelligence or by bluntness of feeling orby dull stare of terror in the eyes the terror of soul of starvingIrish village in which the curfew was still nightly fear
Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle MatDavin the athlete the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legendof Ireland
The gossip of his fellowstudents which strove to renderthe flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think ofhim as young fenian
His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped hisrude imagination by the broken lights of Irish myth
He stood towardsthe myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out line ofbeauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided themselves as they moveddown the cycles in the same attitude as towards the Roman catholicreligion the attitude of dullwitted loyal serf
Whatsoever ofthought or of feeling came to him from England or by way of Englishculture his mind stood armed against in obedience to password and ofthe world that lay beyond England he knew only the foreign legion ofFrance in which he spoke of serving
Coupling this ambition with the young mans humour Stephen had oftencalled him one of the tame geese and there was even point ofirritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speechand deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between Stephensmind eager of speculation and the hidden ways of Irish life
One night the young peasant his spirit stung by the violent orluxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence ofintellectual revolt had called up before Stephens mind strangevision
The two were walking slowly towards Davins rooms through thedark narrow streets of the poorer jews
thing happened to myself Stevie last autumn coming on winter andI never told it to living soul and you are the first person now Iever told it to
disremember if it was October or November
It wasOctober because it was before came up here to join the matriculationclass
Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friends faceflattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speakerssimple accent
was away all that day from my own place over in ButtevantI dontknow if you know where that isat hurling match between the CrokesOwn Boys and the Fearless Thurles and by God Stevie that was the hardfight
My first cousin Fonsy Davin was stripped to his buff that dayminding cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half thetime and shouting like mad
never will forget that day
One of theCrokes made woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and declareto God he was within an aims ace of getting it at the side of histemple
Oh honest to God if the crook of it caught him that time hewas done for
am glad he escaped Stephen had said with laugh but surely thatsnot the strange thing that happened you
Well suppose that doesnt interest you but leastways there wassuch noise after the match that missed the train home and couldntget any kind of yoke to give me lift for as luck would have itthere was mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and allthe cars in the country were there
So there was nothing for it only tostay the night or to foot it out
Well started to walk and on wentand it was coming on night when got into the Ballyhoura hills thatsbetter than ten miles from Kilmallock and theres long lonely roadafter that
You wouldnt see the sign of christian house along theroad or hear sound
It was pitch dark almost
Once or twice stoppedby the way under bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew wasthick Id have stretched out there and slept
At last after bend ofthe road spied little cottage with light in the window
wentup and knocked at the door
voice asked who was there and answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that Idbe thankful for glass of water
After while young woman openedthe door and brought me out big mug of milk
She was half undressedas if she was going to bed when knocked and she had her hair hangingand thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyesthat she must be carrying child
She kept me in talk long while atthe door and thought it strange because her breast and her shoulderswere bare
She asked me was tired and would like to stop the nightthere
She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband hadgone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off
And allthe time she was talking Stevie she had her eyes fixed on my face andshe stood so close to me could hear her breathing
When handed herback the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the thresholdand said Come in and stay the night here
Youve no call to befrightened
Theres no one in it but ourselves didnt go inStevie
thanked her and went on my way again all in fever
At thefirst bend of the road looked back and she was standing at the door
The last words of Davins story sang in his memory and the figure ofthe woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of thepeasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at Clane as thecollege cars drove by as type of her race and of his own batlikesoul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy andloneliness and through the eyes and voice and gesture of womanwithout guile calling the stranger to her bed
hand was laid on his arm and young voice criedAh gentleman your own girl sir
The first handsel today gentleman
Buy that lovely bunch
Will you gentleman
The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyesseemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness and he haltedtill the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and dampcoarse hair and hoydenish face
Do gentleman
Dont forget your own girl sir
have no money said Stephen
Buy them lovely ones will you sir
Only penny
Did you hear what said
asked Stephen bending towards her
toldyou had no money
tell you again now
Well sure you will some day sir please God the girl answeredafter an instant
Possibly said Stephen but dont think it likely
He left her quickly fearing that her intimacy might turn to gibing andwishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another atourist from England or student of Trinity
Grafton Street alongwhich he walked prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty
In theroadway at the head of the street slab was set to the memory of WolfeTone and he remembered having been present with his father at itslaying
He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute
There were four French delegates in brake and one plump smilingyoung man held wedged on stick card on which were printed thewords Vive lIrlandeBut the trees in Stephens Green were fragrant of rain and therainsodden earth gave forth its mortal odour faint incense risingupward through the mould from many hearts
The soul of the gallantvenal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to afaint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in momentwhen he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of acorruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley
It was too late to go upstairs to the French class
He crossed the halland took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre
Thecorridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful
Why did he feel thatit was not unwatchful
Was it because he had heard that in BuckWhaleys time there was secret staircase there
Or was the jesuithouse extraterritorial and was he walking among aliens
The Ireland ofTone and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space
He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey lightthat struggled through the dusty windows
figure was crouching beforethe large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it wasthe dean of studies lighting the fire
Stephen closed the door quietlyand approached the fireplace
Good morning sir
Can help you
The priest looked up quickly and saidOne moment now Mr Dedalus and you will see
There is an art inlighting fire
We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts
This is one of the useful arts
will try to learn it said Stephen
Not too much coal said the dean working briskly at his task that isone of the secrets
He produced four candlebutts from the sidepockets of his soutane andplaced them deftly among the coals and twisted papers
Stephen watchedhim in silence
Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire andbusied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candlebutts heseemed more than ever humble server making ready the place ofsacrifice in an empty temple levite of the Lord
Like levitesrobe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figureof one whom the canonicals or the bellbordered ephod would irk andtrouble
His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lordintending the fire upon the altar in bearing tidings secretly inwaiting upon worldlings in striking swiftly when biddenand yet hadremained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty
Nay hisvery soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards lightand beauty or spreading abroad sweet odour of her sanctityamortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience thanwas to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body spare and sinewygreyed with silverpointed down
The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch
Stephen to fill the silence saidI am sure could not light fire
You are an artist are you not Mr Dedalus
said the dean glancing upand blinking his pale eyes
The object of the artist is the creation ofthe beautiful
What the beautiful is is another question
He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty
Can you solve that question now
he asked
Aquinas answered Stephen says pulcra sunt quæ visa placent
This fire before us said the dean will be pleasing to the eye
Willit therefore be beautiful
In so far as it is apprehended by the sight which suppose meanshere esthetic intellection it will be beautiful
But Aquinas also saysBonum est in quod tendit appetitus
In so far as it satisfies theanimal craving for warmth fire is good
In hell however it is anevil
Quite so said the dean you have certainly hit the nail on the head
He rose nimbly and went towards the door set it ajar and saidA draught is said to be help in these matters
As he came back to the hearth limping slightly but with brisk stepStephen saw the silent soul of jesuit look out at him from the paleloveless eyes
Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned nospark of Ignatius enthusiasm
Even the legendary craft of the companya craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtlewisdom had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship
Itseemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world asbidden to do for the greater glory of God without joy in theirhandling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning themwith firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all thissilent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master andlittle if at all the ends he served
Similiter atque senis baculushe was as the founder would have had him like staff in an old manshand to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weatherto lie with ladys nosegay on garden seat to be raised in menace
The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin
When may we expect to have something from you on the estheticquestion
he asked
From me
said Stephen in astonishment
stumble on an idea once afortnight if am lucky
These questions are very profound Mr Dedalus said the dean
It islike looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the depths
Many godown into the depths and never come up
Only the trained diver can godown into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again
If you mean speculation sir said Stephen also am sure that thereis no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must bebound by its own laws
For my purpose can work on at present by the light of one or twoideas of Aristotle and Aquinas
quite see your point
need them only for my own use and guidance until have donesomething for myself by their light
If the lamp smokes or smells Ishall try to trim it
If it does not give light enough shall sell itand buy another
Epictetus also had lamp said the dean which was sold for fancyprice after his death
It was the lamp he wrote his philosophicaldissertations by
You know Epictetus
An old gentleman said Stephen coarsely who said that the soul isvery like bucketful of water
He tells us in his homely way the dean went on that he put an ironlamp before statue of one of the gods and that thief stole thelamp
What did the philosopher do
He reflected that it was in thecharacter of thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lampnext day instead of the iron lamp
smell of molten tallow came up from the deans candle butts and fuseditself in Stephens consciousness with the jingle of the words bucketand lamp and lamp and bucket
The priests voice too had hardjingling tone
Stephens mind halted by instinct checked by thestrange tone and the imagery and by the priests face which seemed likean unlit lamp or reflector hung in false focus
What lay behind itor within it
dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of thethundercloud charged with intellection and capable of the gloom ofGod
meant different kind of lamp sir said Stephen
Undoubtedly said the dean
One difficulty said Stephen in esthetic discussion is to knowwhether words are being used according to the literary tradition oraccording to the tradition of the marketplace
remember sentence ofNewmans in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was detainedin the full company of the saints
The use of the word in themarketplace is quite different
hope am not detaining youNot in the least said the dean politely
No no said Stephen smiling meanYes yes see said the dean quickly quite catch the pointdetain
He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered dry short cough
To return to the lamp he said the feeding of it is also niceproblem
You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when youpour it in not to overflow it not to pour in more than the funnel canhold
What funnel
asked Stephen
The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp
said Stephen
Is that called funnel
Is it not tundish
What is tundish
The the funnel
Is that called tundish in Ireland
asked the dean
never heard theword in my life
It is called tundish in Lower Drumcondra said Stephen laughingwhere they speak the best English
tundish said the dean reflectively
That is most interestingword
must look that word up
Upon my word must
His courtesy of manner rang little false and Stephen looked at theEnglish convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parablemay have turned on the prodigal
humble follower in the wake ofclamorous conversions poor Englishman in Ireland he seemed to haveentered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play ofintrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been allbut given througha latecomer tardy spirit
From what had he setout
Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters seeingsalvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of theestablishment
Had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid thewelter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms sixprinciple men peculiar people seed and snake baptists supralapsariandogmatists
Had he found the true church all of sudden in winding upto the end like reel of cotton some finespun line of reasoning uponinsufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the HolyGhost
Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow like thatdisciple who had sat at the receipt of custom as he sat by the door ofsome zincroofed chapel yawning and telling over his church pence
The dean repeated the word yet again
Well now that is interesting
The question you asked me moment ago seems to me more interesting
What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps ofearth said Stephen coldly
The little word seemed to have turned rapier point of hissensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe
He felt with asmart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was acountryman of Ben Jonson
He thoughtThe language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine
Howdifferent are the words home Christ ale master on his lips and onmine
cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit
Hislanguage so familiar and so foreign will always be for me an acquiredspeech
have not made or accepted its words
My voice holds them atbay
My soul frets in the shadow of his language
And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime the deanadded to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty
And toinquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts
These are some interesting points we might take up
Stephen disheartened suddenly by the deans firm dry tone wassilent and through the silence distant noise of many boots andconfused voices came up the staircase
In pursuing these speculations said the dean conclusively there ishowever the danger of perishing of inanition
First you must take yourdegree
Set that before you as your first aim
Then little by littleyou will see your way
mean in every sense your way in life and inthinking
It may be uphill pedalling at first
Take Mr Moonan
He was along time before he got to the top
But he got there
may not have his talent said Stephen quietly
You never know said the dean brightly
We never can say what is inus
most certainly should not be despondent
Per aspera ad astraHe left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee thearrival of the first arts class
Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly andimpartially every student of the class and could almost see the franksmiles of the coarser students
desolating pity began to fall likedew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful servingman ofthe knightly Loyola for this halfbrother of the clergy more venalthan they in speech more steadfast of soul than they one whom hewould never call his ghostly father and he thought how this man andhis companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not ofthe unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded duringall their history at the bar of Gods justice for the souls of the laxand the lukewarm and the prudent
The entry of the professor was signalled by few rounds of Kentishfire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tierof the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows
The calling ofthe roll began and the responses to the names were given out in alltones until the name of Peter Byrne was reached
deep bass note in response came from the upper tier followed bycoughs of protest along the other benches
The professor paused in his reading and called the next nameCranly
No answer
Mr Cranly
smile flew across Stephens face as he thought of his friendsstudies
Try Leopardstown
said voice from the bench behind
Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihans snoutish face outlined onthe grey light was impassive
formula was given out
Amid therustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back again and saidGive me some paper for Gods sake
Are you as bad as that
asked Moynihan with broad grin
He tore sheet from his scribbler and passed it down whisperingIn case of necessity any layman or woman can do it
The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper thecoiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor the spectrelikesymbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded Stephens mind
Hehad heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason
Othe grey dull day
It seemed limbo of painless patient consciousnessthrough which souls of mathematicians might wander projecting longslender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilightradiating swift eddies to the last verges of universe ever vasterfarther and more impalpable
So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal
Perhapssome of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of Mr SGilbert
In one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who iscondemned to play On cloth untrue With twisted cue And elliptical billiard balls
He means ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal axesof which spoke moment ago
Moynihan leaned down towards Stephens ear and murmuredWhat price ellipsoidal balls
chase me ladies Im in the cavalry
His fellow students rude humour ran like gust through the cloisterof Stephens mind shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments thathung upon the walls setting them to sway and caper in sabbath ofmisrule
The forms of the community emerged from the gustblownvestments the dean of studies the portly florid bursar with his capof grey hair the president the little priest with feathery hair whowrote devout verses the squat peasant form of the professor ofeconomics the tall form of the young professor of mental sciencediscussing on the landing case of conscience with his class like agiraffe cropping high leafage among herd of antelopes the gravetroubled prefect of the sodality the plump roundheaded professor ofItalian with his rogues eyes
They came ambling and stumblingtumbling and capering kilting their gowns for leap frog holding oneanother back shaken with deep false laughter smacking one anotherbehind and laughing at their rude malice calling to one another byfamiliar nicknames protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usagewhispering two and two behind their hands
The professor had gone to the glass cases on the sidewall from shelfof which he took down set of coils blew away the dust from manypoints and bearing it carefully to the table held finger on itwhile he proceeded with his lecture
He explained that the wires inmodern coils were of compound called platinoid lately discovered byF Martino
He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer
Moynihanwhispered from behindGood old Fresh Water Martin
Ask him Stephen whispered back with weary humour if he wants asubject for electrocution
He can have me
Moynihan seeing the professor bend over the coils rose in his benchand clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand began to callwith the voice of slobbering urchinPlease teacher
This boy is after saying bad word teacher
Platinoid the professor said solemnly is preferred to German silverbecause it has lower coefficient of resistance by changes oftemperature
The platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silkthat insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my fingeris
If it were wound single an extra current would be induced in thecoils
The bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin waxA sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below StephenAre we likely to be asked questions on applied science
The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science andapplied science
heavybuilt student wearing gold spectacles staredwith some wonder at the questioner
Moynihan murmured from behind inhis natural voiceIsnt MacAlister devil for his pound of flesh
Stephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown withtangled twinecoloured hair
The voice the accent the mind of thequestioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towardswilful unkindness bidding his mind think that the students fatherwould have done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and havesaved something on the train fare by so doing
The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought andyet the shaft came back to its bowstring for he saw in moment thestudents wheypale face
That thought is not mine he said to himself quickly
It came from thecomic Irishman in the bench behind
Can you say withcertitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its electbetrayedby the questioner or by the mocker
It is probably in his character to ask such question atsuch moment in such tone and to pronounce the word science as amonosyllable
The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowlyround and round the coils it spoke of doubling trebling quadruplingits somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance
Moynihans voice called from behind in echo to distant bellClosing time gents
The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk
On table near thedoor were two photographs in frames and between them long roll ofpaper bearing an irregular tail of signatures
MacCann went briskly toand fro among the students talking rapidly answering rebuffs andleading one after another to the table
In the inner hall the dean ofstudies stood talking to young professor stroking his chin gravelyand nodding his head
Stephen checked by the crowd at the door halted irresolutely
Fromunder the wide falling leaf of soft hat Cranlys dark eyes werewatching him
Have you signed
Stephen asked
Cranly closed his long thinlipped mouth communed with himself aninstant and answeredEgo habeo
What is it for
QuodWhat is it for
Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and bitterlyPer pax universalisStephen pointed to the Tsars photograph and saidHe has the face of besotted Christ
The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranlys eyes back from calmsurvey of the walls of the hall
Are you annoyed
he asked
No answered Stephen
Are you in bad humour
Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis said Cranly quia faciesvostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estisMoynihan on his way to the table said in Stephens earMacCann is in tiptop form
Ready to shed the last drop
Brand newworld
No stimulants and votes for the bitches
Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and when Moynihan hadpassed turned again to meet Cranlys eyes
Perhaps you can tell me he said why he pours his soul so freely intomy ear
Can you
dull scowl appeared on Cranlys forehead
He stared at the tablewhere Moynihan had bent to write his name on the roll and then saidflatlyA sugar
Quis est in malo humore said Stephen ego aut vosCranly did not take up the taunt
He brooded sourly on his judgementand repeated with the same flat forceA flaming bloody sugar thats what he is
It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen wonderedwhether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory
Theheavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like stone through aquagmire
Stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another feeling itsheaviness depress his heart
Cranlys speech unlike that of Davin hadneither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turnedversions of Irish idioms
Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublingiven back by bleak decaying seaport its energy an echo of thesacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by Wicklow pulpit
The heavy scowl faded from Cranlys face as MacCann marched brisklytowards them from the other side of the hall
Here you are
said MacCann cheerily
Here am
said Stephen
Late as usual
Can you not combine the progressive tendency with arespect for punctuality
That question is out of order said Stephen
Next business
His smiling eyes were fixed on silverwrapped tablet of milkchocolate which peeped out of the propagandists breastpocket
Alittle ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits
leanstudent with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between thetwo glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to tryto catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth
Cranly took asmall grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closelyturning it over and over
Next business
said MacCann
He gave loud cough of laughter smiled broadly and tugged twice atthe strawcoloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin
The next business is to sign the testimonial
Will you pay me anything if sign
asked Stephen
thought you were an idealist said MacCann
The gipsylike student looked about him and addressed the onlookers inan indistinct bleating voice
By hell thats queer notion
consider that notion to be amercenary notion
His voice faded into silence
No heed was paid to his words
He turnedhis olive face equine in expression towards Stephen inviting him tospeak again
MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Tsars rescript ofStead of general disarmament arbitration in cases of internationaldisputes of the signs of the times of the new humanity and the newgospel of life which would make it the business of the community tosecure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of thegreatest possible number
The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by cryingThree cheers for universal brotherhood
Go on Temple said stout ruddy student near him
Ill stand you apint after
Im believer in universal brotherhood said Temple glancing abouthim out of his dark oval eyes
Marx is only bloody cod
Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue smiling uneasilyand repeatedEasy easy easy
Temple struggled to free his arm but continued his mouth flecked by athin foamSocialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in Europe whopreached the freedom of thought was Collins
Two hundred years ago
Hedenounced priestcraft the philosopher of Middlesex
Three cheers forJohn Anthony Collins
thin voice from the verge of the ring repliedPip
Moynihan murmured beside Stephens earAnd what about John Anthonys poor little sister Lottie Collins lost her drawers Wont you kindly lend her yours
Stephen laughed and Moynihan pleased with the result murmured againWell have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins
am waiting for your answer said MacCann briefly
The affair doesnt interest me in the least said Stephen wearily
Youknow that well
Why do you make scene about it
said MacCann smacking his lips
You are reactionary then
Do you think you impress me Stephen asked when you flourish yourwooden sword
said MacCann bluntly
Come to facts
Stephen blushed and turned aside
MacCann stood his ground and saidwith hostile humourMinor poets suppose are above such trivial questions as thequestion of universal peace
Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the two studentsby way of peaceoffering sayingPax super totum sanguinarium globumStephen moving away the bystanders jerked his shoulder angrily in thedirection of the Tsars image sayingKeep your icon
If we must have Jesus let us have legitimateJesus
By hell thats good one
said the gipsy student to those about himthats fine expression
like that expression immensely
He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping down thephrase and fumbling at the peak of his tweed cap turned to StephensayingExcuse me sir what do you mean by that expression you uttered justnow
Feeling himself jostled by the students near him he said to themI am curious to know now what he meant by that expression
He turned again to Stephen and said in whisperDo you believe in Jesus
believe in man
Of course dont know ifyou believe in man
admire you sir
admire the mind of manindependent of all religions
Is that your opinion about the mind ofJesus
Go on Temple said the stout ruddy student returning as was hiswont to his first idea that pint is waiting for you
He thinks Im an imbecile Temple explained to Stephen because Im abeliever in the power of mind
Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer and saidNos ad manum ballum jocabimusStephen in the act of being led away caught sight of MacCannsflushed bluntfeatured face
My signature is of no account he said politely
You are right to goyour way
Leave me to go mine
Dedalus said MacCann crisply believe youre good fellow but youhave yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of thehuman individual
voice saidIntellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in it
Stephen recognising the harsh tone of MacAlisters voice did not turnin the direction of the voice
Cranly pushed solemnly through thethrong of students linking Stephen and Temple like celebrantattended by his ministers on his way to the altar
Temple bent eagerly across Cranlys breast and saidDid you hear MacAlister what he said
That youth is jealous of you
Did you see that
bet Cranly didnt see that
By hell saw that atonce
As they crossed the inner hall the dean of studies was in the act ofescaping from the student with whom he had been conversing
He stood atthe foot of the staircase foot on the lowest step his threadbaresoutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care noddinghis head often and repeatingNot doubt of it Mr Hackett
Very fine
Not doubt of it
In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality wasspeaking earnestly in soft querulous voice with boarder
As hespoke he wrinkled little his freckled brow and bit between hisphrases at tiny bone pencil
hope the matric men will all come
The first arts men are prettysure
Second arts too
We must make sure of the newcomers
Temple bent again across Cranly as they were passing through thedoorway and said in swift whisperDo you know that he is married man
He was married man before theyconverted him
He has wife and children somewhere
By hell thinkthats the queerest notion ever heard
His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter
The moment theywere through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shookhim sayingYou flaming floundering fool
Ill take my dying bible there isnt abigger bloody ape do you know than you in the whole flaming bloodyworld
Temple wriggled in his grip laughing still with sly content whileCranly repeated flatly at every rude shakeA flaming flaring bloody idiot
They crossed the weedy garden together
The president wrapped in aheavy loose cloak was coming towards them along one of the walksreading his office
At the end of the walk he halted before turning andraised his eyes
The students saluted Temple fumbling as before at thepeak of his cap
They walked forward in silence
As they neared thealley Stephen could hear the thuds of the players hands and the wetsmacks of the ball and Davins voice crying out excitedly at eachstroke
The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat to followthe game
Temple after few moments sidled across to Stephen andsaidExcuse me wanted to ask you do you believe that Jean JacquesRousseau was sincere man
Stephen laughed outright
Cranly picking up the broken stave of caskfrom the grass at his feet turned swiftly and said sternlyTemple declare to the living God if you say another word do youknow to anybody on any subject Ill kill you super spottumHe was like you fancy said Stephen an emotional man
Blast him curse him
said Cranly broadly
Dont talk to him at all
Sure you might as well be talking do you know to flamingchamberpot as talking to Temple
Go home Temple
For Gods sake gohome
dont care damn about you Cranly answered Temple moving out ofreach of the uplifted stave and pointing at Stephen
Hes the only manI see in this institution that has an individual mind
cried Cranly
Go home blast you for yourea hopeless bloody man
Im an emotional man said Temple
Thats quite rightly expressed
AndIm proud that Im an emotionalist
He sidled out of the alley smiling slily
Cranly watched him with ablank expressionless face
Look at him
he said
Did you ever see such gobythewall
His phrase was greeted by strange laugh from student who loungedagainst the wall his peaked cap down on his eyes
The laugh pitchedin high key and coming from so muscular frame seemed like thewhinny of an elephant
The students body shook all over and to easehis mirth he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins
Lynch is awake said Cranly
Lynch for answer straightened himself and thrust forward his chest
Lynch puts out his chest said Stephen as criticism of life
Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and saidWho has anything to say about my girth
Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle
When theirfaces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart panting
Stephenbent down towards Davin who intent on the game had paid no heed tothe talk of the others
And how is my little tame goose
he asked
Did he sign too
Davin nodded and saidAnd you Stevie
Stephen shook his head
Youre terrible man Stevie said Davin taking the short pipe fromhis mouth always alone
Now that you have signed the petition for universal peace saidStephen suppose you will burn that little copybook saw in yourroom
As Davin did not answer Stephen began to quoteLong pace fianna
Right incline fianna
Fianna by numbers saluteone two
Thats different question said Davin
Im an Irish nationalistfirst and foremost
But thats you all out
Youre born sneererStevie
When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks said Stephen andwant the indispensable informer tell me
can find you few in thiscollege
cant understand you said Davin
One time hear you talk againstEnglish literature
Now you talk against the Irish informers
What withyour name and your ideas
Are you Irish at all
Come with me now to the office of arms and will show you the tree ofmy family said Stephen
Then be one of us said Davin
Why dont you learn Irish
Why did youdrop out of the league class after the first lesson
You know one reason why answered Stephen
Davin tossed his head and laughed
Oh come now he said
Is it on account of that certain young lady andFather Moran
But thats all in your own mind Stevie
They were onlytalking and laughing
Stephen paused and laid friendly hand upon Davins shoulder
Do you remember he said when we knew each other first
The firstmorning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculationclass putting very strong stress on the first syllable
Then you used to address the jesuits as father you remember
ask myself about you Is he as innocent as his speechIm simple person said Davin
You know that
When you told me thatnight in Harcourt Street those things about your private life honestto God Stevie was not able to eat my dinner
was quite bad
wasawake long time that night
Why did you tell me those things
Thanks said Stephen
You mean am monster
No said Davin
But wish you had not told me
tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephensfriendliness
This race and this country and this life produced me he said
shallexpress myself as am
Try to be one of us repeated Davin
In heart you are an Irishman butyour pride is too powerful
My ancestors threw off their language and took another Stephen said
They allowed handful of foreigners to subject them
Do you fancy amgoing to pay in my own life and person debts they made
What for
For our freedom said Davin
No honourable and sincere man said Stephen has given up to you hislife and his youth and his affections from the days of Tone to those ofParnell but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviledhim and left him for another
And you invite me to be one of you
Idsee you damned first
They died for their ideals Stevie said Davin
Our day will come yetbelieve me
Stephen following his own thought was silent for an instant
The soul is born he said vaguely first in those moments told youof
It has slow and dark birth more mysterious than the birth of thebody
When the soul of man is born in this country there are netsflung at it to hold it back from flight
You talk to me of nationalitylanguage religion
shall try to fly by those nets
Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe
Too deep for me Stevie he said
But mans country comes first
Ireland first Stevie
You can be poet or mystic after
Do you know what Ireland is
asked Stephen with cold violence
Irelandis the old sow that eats her farrow
Davin rose from his box and went towards the players shaking his headsadly
But in moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputingwith Cranly and the two players who had finished their game
match offour was arranged Cranly insisting however that his ball should beused
He let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck itstrongly and swiftly towards the base of the alley exclaiming inanswer to its thudYour soul
Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise
Then he pluckedhim by the sleeve to come away
Lynch obeyed sayingLet us eke go as Cranly has it
Stephen smiled at this sidethrust
They passed back through the garden and out through the hall where thedoddering porter was pinning up hall notice in the frame
At the footof the steps they halted and Stephen took packet of cigarettes fromhis pocket and offered it to his companion
know you are poor he said
Damn your yellow insolence answered Lynch
This second proof of Lynchs culture made Stephen smile again
It was great day for European culture he said when you made upyour mind to swear in yellow
They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right
After pauseStephen beganAristotle has not defined pity and terror
sayLynch halted and said bluntlyStop
wont listen
am sick
was out last night on yellowdrunk with Horan and Goggins
Stephen went onPity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence ofwhatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it withthe human sufferer
Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in thepresence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings andunites it with the secret cause
Repeat said Lynch
Stephen repeated the definitions slowly
girl got into hansom few days ago he went on in London
Shewas on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years
At the corner of street the shaft of lorry shivered the window ofthe hansom in the shape of star
long fine needle of the shiveredglass pierced her heart
She died on the instant
The reporter calledit tragic death
It is not
It is remote from terror and pityaccording to the terms of my definitions
The tragic emotion in fact is face looking two ways towardsterror and towards pity both of which are phases of it
You see usethe word arrest
mean that the tragic emotion is static
Or ratherthe dramatic emotion is
The feelings excited by improper art arekinetic desire or loathing
Desire urges us to possess to go tosomething loathing urges us to abandon to go from something
The artswhich excite them pornographical or didactic are therefore improperarts
The esthetic emotion used the general term is thereforestatic
The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing
You say that art must not excite desire said Lynch
told you thatone day wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the Venus ofPraxiteles in the Museum
Was that not desire
speak of normal natures said Stephen
You also told me that whenyou were boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces ofdried cowdung
Lynch broke again into whinny of laughter and again rubbed both hishands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets
he cried
Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for momentboldly in the eyes
Lynch recovering from his laughter answered hislook from his humbled eyes
The long slender flattened skull beneaththe long pointed cap brought before Stephens mind the image of ahooded reptile
The eyes too were reptilelike in glint and gaze
Yetat that instant humbled and alert in their look they were lit by onetiny human point the window of shrivelled soul poignant andselfembittered
As for that Stephen said in polite parenthesis we are all animals
Ialso am an animal
You are said Lynch
But we are just now in mental world Stephen continued
The desireand loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not estheticemotions not only because they are kinetic in character but alsobecause they are not more than physical
Our flesh shrinks from what itdreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by purelyreflex action of the nervous system
Our eyelid closes before we areaware that the fly is about to enter our eye
Not always said Lynch critically
In the same way said Stephen your flesh responded to the stimulus ofa naked statue but it was say simply reflex action of thenerves
Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotionwhich is kinetic or sensation which is purely physical
It awakensor ought to awaken or induces or ought to induce an esthetic stasisan ideal pity or an ideal terror stasis called forth prolonged andat last dissolved by what call the rhythm of beauty
What is that exactly
asked Lynch
Rhythm said Stephen is the first formal esthetic relation of part topart in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or partsor of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is part
If that is rhythm said Lynch let me hear what you call beauty andplease remember though did eat cake of cowdung once that admireonly beauty
Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting
Then blushing slightly helaid his hand on Lynchs thick tweed sleeve
We are right he said and the others are wrong
To speak of thesethings and to try to understand their nature and having understood itto try slowly and humbly and constantly to express to press out againfrom the gross earth or what it brings forth from sound and shape andcolour which are the prison gates of our soul an image of the beautywe have come to understandthat is art
They had reached the canal bridge and turning from their course wenton by the trees
crude grey light mirrored in the sluggish water anda smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against thecourse of Stephens thought
But you have not answered my question said Lynch
What is art
Whatis the beauty it expresses
That was the first definition gave you you sleepyheaded wretchsaid Stephen when began to try to think out the matter for myself
Do you remember the night
Cranly lost his temper and began to talkabout Wicklow bacon
remember said Lynch
He told us about them flaming fat devils ofpigs
Art said Stephen is the human disposition of sensible orintelligible matter for an esthetic end
You remember the pigs andforget that
You are distressing pair you and Cranly
Lynch made grimace at the raw grey sky and saidIf am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least anothercigarette
dont care about it
dont even care about women
Damnyou and damn everything
want job of five hundred year
You cantget me one
Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes
Lynch took the last onethat remained saying simplyProceed
Aquinas said Stephen says that is beautiful the apprehension ofwhich pleases
Lynch nodded
remember that he said Pulcra sunt quæ visa placentHe uses the word visa said Stephen to cover esthetic apprehensionsof all kinds whether through sight or hearing or through any otheravenue of apprehension
This word though it is vague is clear enoughto keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing
It meanscertainly stasis and not kinesis
How about the true
It producesalso stasis of the mind
You would not write your name in pencilacross the hypothenuse of rightangled triangle
No said Lynch give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of Praxiteles
Static therefore said Stephen
Plato believe said that beauty isthe splendour of truth
dont think that it has meaning but thetrue and the beautiful are akin
Truth is beheld by the intellect whichis appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligiblebeauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the mostsatisfying relations of the sensible
The first step in the directionof truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itselfto comprehend the act itself of intellection
Aristotles entire systemof philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that thinkrests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same timeand in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject
The first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frameand scope of the imagination to comprehend the act itself of estheticapprehension
Is that clear
But what is beauty
asked Lynch impatiently
Out with anotherdefinition
Something we see and like
Is that the best you and Aquinascan do
Let us take woman said Stephen
Let us take her
said Lynch fervently
The Greek the Turk the Chinese the Copt the Hottentot saidStephen all admire different type of female beauty
That seems to bea maze out of which we cannot escape
see however two ways out
Oneis this hypothesis that every physical quality admired by men in womenis in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for thepropagation of the species
It may be so
The world it seems isdrearier than even you Lynch imagined
For my part dislike that wayout
It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic
It leads you out ofthe maze into new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann with one hand onThe Origin of Species and the other hand on the new testament tellsyou that you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt thatshe would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breastsbecause you felt that she would give good milk to her children andyours
Then MacCann is sulphuryellow liar said Lynch energetically
There remains another way out said Stephen laughing
To wit
said Lynch
This hypothesis Stephen began
long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of Sir PatrickDuns hospital covering the end of Stephens speech with the harsh roarof jangled and rattling metal
Lynch closed his ears and gave out oathafter oath till the dray had passed
Then he turned on his heel rudely
Stephen turned also and waited for few moments till his companionsillhumour had had its vent
This hypothesis Stephen repeated is the other way out that thoughthe same object may not seem beautiful to all people all people whoadmire beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfyand coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension
These relations of the sensible visible to you through one form and tome through another must be therefore the necessary qualities ofbeauty
Now we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for anotherpennyworth of wisdom
Lynch laughed
It amuses me vastly he said to hear you quoting him time after timelike jolly round friar
Are you laughing in your sleeve
MacAlister answered Stephen would call my esthetic theory appliedAquinas
So far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends Aquinaswill carry me all along the line
When we come to the phenomena ofartistic conception artistic gestation and artistic reproduction Irequire new terminology and new personal experience
Of course said Lynch
After all Aquinas in spite of his intellectwas exactly good round friar
But you will tell me about the newpersonal experience and new terminology some other day
Hurry up andfinish the first part
Who knows
said Stephen smiling
Perhaps Aquinas would understand mebetter than you
He was poet himself
He wrote hymn for MaundyThursday
It begins with the words Pange lingua gloriosi They say itis the highest glory of the hymnal
It is an intricate and soothinghymn
like it but there is no hymn that can be put beside thatmournful and majestic processional song the Vexilla Regis ofVenantius Fortunatus
Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in deep bass voice Inpleta sunt quæ concinit David fideli carmine Dicendo nationibus Regnavit ligno Deus
Thats great
he said well pleased
Great music
They turned into Lower Mount Street
few steps from the corner fatyoung man wearing silk neckcloth saluted them and stopped
Did you hear the results of the exams
he asked
Griffin was plucked
Halpin and OFlynn are through the home civil
Moonan got fifth placein the Indian
OShaughnessy got fourteenth
The Irish fellows inClarks gave them feed last night
They all ate curry
His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and as he hadadvanced through his tidings of success his small fatencircled eyesvanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing
In reply to question of Stephens his eyes and his voice came forthagain from their lurkingplaces
Yes MacCullagh and he said
Hes taking pure mathematics and Imtaking constitutional history
There are twenty subjects
Im takingbotany too
You know Im member of the field club
He drew back from the other two in stately fashion and placed plumpwoollengloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughterat once broke forth
Bring us few turnips and onions the next time you go out saidStephen drily to make stew
The fat student laughed indulgently and saidWe are all highly respectable people in the field club
Last Saturdaywe went out to Glenmalure seven of us
With women Donovan
said Lynch
Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and saidOur end is the acquisition of knowledge
Then he said quicklyI hear you are writing some essays about esthetics
Stephen made vague gesture of denial
Goethe and Lessing said Donovan have written lot on that subjectthe classical school and the romantic school and all that
The Laocooninterested me very much when read it
Of course it is idealisticGerman ultraprofound
Neither of the others spoke
Donovan took leave of them urbanely
must go he said softly and benevolently have strong suspicionamounting almost to conviction that my sister intended to makepancakes today for the dinner of the Donovan family
Goodbye Stephen said in his wake
Dont forget the turnips for me andmy mate
Lynch gazed after him his lip curling in slow scorn till his faceresembled devils maskTo think that that yellow pancakeeating excrement can get good jobhe said at length and have to smoke cheap cigarettes
They turned their faces towards Merrion Square and went for little insilence
To finish what was saying about beauty said Stephen the mostsatisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to thenecessary phases of artistic apprehension
Find these and you find thequalities of universal beauty
Aquinas says Ad pulcritudinem triarequiruntur integritas consonantia claritas translate it soThree things are needed for beauty wholeness harmony and radianceDo these correspond to the phases of apprehension
Are you following
Of course am said Lynch
If you think have an excrementitiousintelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen to you
Stephen pointed to basket which butchers boy had slung inverted onhis head
Look at that basket he said
see it said Lynch
In order to see that basket said Stephen your mind first of allseparates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is notthe basket
The first phase of apprehension is bounding line drawnabout the object to be apprehended
An esthetic image is presented tous either in space or in time
What is audible is presented in timewhat is visible is presented in space
But temporal or spatial theesthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded andselfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time whichis not it
You apprehended it as one thing
You see it as one whole
You apprehend its wholeness
That is integritasBulls eye
said Lynch laughing
Go on
Then said Stephen you pass from point to point led by its formallines you apprehend it as balanced part against part within itslimits you feel the rhythm of its structure
In other words thesynthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis ofapprehension
Having first felt that it is one thing you feel nowthat it is thing
You apprehend it as complex multiple divisibleseparable made up of its parts the result of its parts and their sumharmonious
That is consonantia
Bulls eye again
said Lynch wittily
Tell me now what is claritasand you win the cigar
The connotation of the word Stephen said is rather vague
Aquinasuses term which seems to be inexact
It baffled me for long time
It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealismthe supreme quality of beauty being light from some other world theidea of which the matter is but the shadow the reality of which it isbut the symbol
thought he might mean that claritas is the artisticdiscovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or aforce of generalization which would make the esthetic image universalone make it outshine its proper conditions
But that is literary talk
understand it so
When you have apprehended that basket as one thingand have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as athing you make the only synthesis which is logically and estheticallypermissible
You see that it is that thing which it is and no otherthing
The radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic quidditasthe whatness of thing
This supreme quality is felt by the artistwhen the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination
The mindin that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to fadingcoal
The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty the clearradiance of the esthetic image is apprehended luminously by the mindwhich has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmonyis the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure spiritual statevery like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologistLuigi Galvani using phrase almost as beautiful as Shelleys calledthe enchantment of the heart
Stephen paused and though his companion did not speak felt that hiswords had called up around them thoughtenchanted silence
What have said he began again refers to beauty in the wider senseof the word in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition
In the marketplace it has another sense
When we speak of beauty in thesecond sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first placeby the art itself and by the form of that art
The image it is clearmust be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and themind or senses of others
If you bear this in memory you will see thatart necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one tothe next
These forms are the lyrical form the form wherein theartist presents his image in immediate relation to himself the epicalform the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation tohimself and to others the dramatic form the form wherein he presentshis image in immediate relation to others
That you told me few nights ago said Lynch and we began the famousdiscussion
have book at home said Stephen in which have written downquestions which are more amusing than yours were
In finding theanswers to them found the theory of esthetic which am trying toexplain
Here are some questions set myself Is chair finely madetragic or comic
Is the portrait of Mona Lisa good if desire to seeit
Is the bust of Sir Philip Crampton lyrical epical or dramatic
Ifnot why notWhy not indeed
said Lynch laughing
If man hacking in fury at block of wood Stephen continuedmake there an image of cow is that image work of art
If not whynotThats lovely one said Lynch laughing again
That has the truescholastic stink
Lessing said Stephen should not have taken group of statues towrite of
The art being inferior does not present the forms spokeof distinguished clearly one from another
Even in literature thehighest and most spiritual art the forms are often confused
Thelyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant ofemotion rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man whopulled at the oar or dragged stones up slope
He who utters it ismore conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feelingemotion
The simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyricalliterature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as thecentre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre ofemotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and fromothers
The narrative is no longer purely personal
The personality ofthe artist passes into the narration itself flowing round and roundthe persons and the action like vital sea
This progress you will seeeasily in that old English ballad Turpin Hero which begins in thefirst person and ends in the third person
The dramatic form is reachedwhen the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fillsevery person with such vital force that he or she assumes proper andintangible esthetic life
The personality of the artist at first cryor cadence or mood and then fluid and lambent narrative finallyrefines itself out of existence impersonalizes itself so to speak
The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in andreprojected from the human imagination
The mystery of esthetic likethat of material creation is accomplished
The artist like the God ofcreation remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiworkinvisible refined out of existence indifferent paring hisfingernails
Trying to refine them also out of existence said Lynch
fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned intothe dukes lawn to reach the national library before the shower came
What do you mean Lynch asked surlily by prating about beauty and theimagination in this miserable Godforsaken island
No wonder the artistretired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated thiscountry
The rain fell faster
When they passed through the passage besideKildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade ofthe library
Cranly leaning against pillar was picking his teethwith sharpened match listening to some companions
Some girls stoodnear the entrance door
Lynch whispered to StephenYour beloved is here
Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group ofstudents heedless of the rain which fell fast turning his eyestowards her from time to time
She too stood silently among hercompanions
She has no priest to flirt with he thought with consciousbitterness remembering how he had seen her last
Lynch was right
Hismind emptied of theory and courage lapsed back into listless peace
He heard the students talking among themselves
They spoke of twofriends who had passed the final medical examination of the chances ofgetting places on ocean liners of poor and rich practices
Thats all bubble
An Irish country practice is better
Hynes was two years in Liverpool and he says the same
frightfulhole he said it was
Nothing but midwifery cases
Do you mean to say it is better to have job here in the country thanin rich city like that
know fellowHynes has no brains
He got through by stewing pure stewing
Dont mind him
Theres plenty of money to be made in big commercialcity
Depends on the practice
Ego credo ut vita pauperum est simpliciter atrox simplicitersanguinarius atrox in LiverpoolioTheir voices reached his ears as if from distance in interruptedpulsation
She was preparing to go away with her companions
The quick light shower had drawn off tarrying in clusters of diamondsamong the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathedforth by the blackened earth
Their trim boots prattled as they stoodon the steps of the colonnade talking quietly and gaily glancing atthe clouds holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the fewlast raindrops closing them again holding their skirts demurely
And if he had judged her harshly
If her life were simple rosary ofhours her life simple and strange as birds life gay in themorning restless all day tired at sundown
Her heart simple andwilful as birds heart
Towards dawn he awoke
what sweet music
His soul was all dewy wet
Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed
He laystill as if his soul lay amid cool waters conscious of faint sweetmusic
His mind was waking slowly to tremulous morning knowledge amorning inspiration
spirit filled him pure as the purest watersweet as dew moving as music
But how faintly it was inbreathed howpassionlessly as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him
His soul was waking slowly fearing to awake wholly
It was thatwindless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to thelight and the moth flies forth silently
An enchantment of the heart
The night had been enchanted
In dreamor vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life
Was it an instantof enchantment only or long hours and years and ages
The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides atonce from multitude of cloudy circumstances of what had happened orof what might have happened
The instant flashed forth like point oflight and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused formwas veiling softly its afterglow
In the virgin womb of theimagination the word was made flesh
Gabriel the seraph had come to thevirgins chamber
An afterglow deepened within his spirit whence thewhite flame had passed deepening to rose and ardent light
That roseand ardent light was her strange wilful heart strange that no man hadknown or would know wilful from before the beginning of the world andlured by that ardent roselike glow the choirs of the seraphim werefalling from heaven
Are you not weary of ardent ways Lure of the fallen seraphim
Tell no more of enchanted days
The verses passed from his mind to his lips and murmuring them overhe felt the rhythmic movement of villanelle pass through them
Theroselike glow sent forth its rays of rhyme ways days blaze praiseraise
Its rays burned up the world consumed the hearts of men andangels the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart
Your eyes have set mans heart ablaze And you have had your will of him
Are you not weary of ardent ways
And then
The rhythm died away ceased began again to move and beat
And then
Smoke incense ascending from the altar of the world
Above the flame the smoke of praise Goes up from ocean rim to rim Tell no more of enchanted days
Smoke went up from the whole earth from the vapoury oceans smoke ofher praise
The earth was like swinging swaying censer ball ofincense an ellipsoidal ball
The rhythm died out at once the cry ofhis heart was broken
His lips began to murmur the first verses overand over then went on stumbling through half verses stammering andbaffled then stopped
The hearts cry was broken
The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the nakedwindow the morning light was gathering
bell beat faintly very faraway
bird twittered two birds three
The bell and the bird ceasedand the dull white light spread itself east and west covering theworld covering the roselight in his heart
Fearing to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to lookfor paper and pencil
There was neither on the table only the soupplate he had eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick withits tendrils of tallow and its paper socket singed by the last flame
He stretched his arm wearily towards the foot of the bed groping withhis hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there
His fingers founda pencil and then cigarette packet
He lay back and tearing open thepacket placed the last cigarette on the window ledge and began towrite out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on therough cardboard surface
Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow murmuring themagain
The lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of thelumps of knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he usedto sit smiling or serious asking himself why he had come displeasedwith her and with himself confounded by the print of the Sacred Heartabove the untenanted sideboard
He saw her approach him in lull ofthe talk and beg him to sing one of his curious songs
Then he sawhimself sitting at the old piano striking chords softly from itsspeckled keys and singing amid the talk which had risen again in theroom to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece dainty song of theElizabethans sad and sweet loth to depart the victory chant ofAgincourt the happy air of Greensleeves
While he sang and shelistened or feigned to listen his heart was at rest but when thequaint old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room heremembered his own sarcasm the house where young men are called bytheir christian names little too soon
At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he hadwaited in vain
She passed now dancing lightly across his memory as shehad been that night at the carnival ball her white dress littlelifted white spray nodding in her hair
She danced lightly in theround
She was dancing towards him and as she came her eyes were alittle averted and faint glow was on her cheek
At the pause in thechain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant soft merchandise
You are great stranger now
was born to be monk
am afraid you are heretic
Are you much afraid
For answer she had danced away from him along the chain of handsdancing lightly and discreetly giving herself to none
The white spraynodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper onher cheek
His own image started forth profaner of the cloister aheretic Franciscan willing and willing not to serve spinning likeGherardino da Borgo San Donnino lithe web of sophistry andwhispering in her ear
No it was not his image
It was like the image of the young priest inwhose company he had seen her last looking at him out of doves eyestoying with the pages of her Irish phrasebook
Yes yes the ladies are coming round to us
can see it every day
The ladies are with us
The best helpers the language has
And the church Father Moran
The church too
Coming round too
The work is going ahead there too
Dont fret about the church
he had done well to leave the room in disdain
He had done wellnot to salute her on the steps of the library
He had done well toleave her to flirt with her priest to toy with church which was thescullerymaid of christendom
Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from hissoul
It broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments onall sides
On all sides distorted reflections of her image started fromhis memory the flower girl in the ragged dress with damp coarse hairand hoydens face who had called herself his own girl and begged hishandsel the kitchengirl in the next house who sang over the clatterof her plates with the drawl of country singer the first bars ofBy Killarneys Lakes and Fells girl who had laughed gaily to seehim stumble when the iron grating in the footpath near Cork Hill hadcaught the broken sole of his shoe girl he had glanced at attractedby her small ripe mouth as she passed out of Jacobs biscuit factorywho had cried to him over her shoulderDo you like what you seen of me straight hair and curly eyebrows
And yet he felt that however he might revile and mock her image hisanger was also form of homage
He had left the classroom in disdainthat was not wholly sincere feeling that perhaps the secret of herrace lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung aquick shadow
He had told himself bitterly as he walked through thestreets that she was figure of the womanhood of her country abatlike soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness andsecrecy and loneliness tarrying awhile loveless and sinless with hermild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in thelatticed ear of priest
His anger against her found vent in coarserailing at her paramour whose name and voice and features offended hisbaffled pride priested peasant with brother policeman in Dublinand brother potboy in Moycullen
To him she would unveil her soulsshy nakedness to one who was but schooled in the discharging of aformal rite rather than to him priest of the eternal imaginationtransmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body ofeverliving life
The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant hisbitter and despairing thoughts their cries arising unbroken in hymnof thanksgiving
Our broken cries and mournful lays Rise in one eucharistic hymn Are you not weary of ardent ways
While sacrificing hands upraise The chalice flowing to the brim Tell no more of enchanted days
He spoke the verses aloud from the first lines till the music andrhythm suffused his mind turning it to quiet indulgence then copiedthem painfully to feel them the better by seeing them then lay back onhis bolster
The full morning light had come
No sound was to be heard but he knewthat all around him life was about to awaken in common noises hoarsevoices sleepy prayers
Shrinking from that life he turned towards thewall making cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblownscarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper
He tried to warm hisperishing joy in their scarlet glow imagining roseway from where helay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers
Hetoo was weary of ardent ways
gradual warmth languorous weariness passed over him descendingalong his spine from his closely cowled head
He felt it descend andseeing himself as he lay smiled
Soon he would sleep
He had written verses for her again after ten years
Ten years beforeshe had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head sending sprays of herwarm breath into the night air tapping her foot upon the glassy road
It was the last tram the lank brown horses knew it and shook theirbells to the clear night in admonition
The conductor talked with thedriver both nodding often in the green light of the lamp
They stoodon the steps of the tram he on the upper she on the lower
She cameup to his step many times between their phrases and went down again andonce or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then wentdown
Let be
Let be
Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly
If he sent her theverses
They would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping ofeggshells
Folly indeed
Her brothers would laugh and try to wrest thepage from each other with their strong hard fingers
The suave priesther uncle seated in his armchair would hold the page at arms lengthread it smiling and approve of the literary form
No no that was folly
Even if he sent her the verses she would notshow them to others
No no she could not
He began to feel that he had wronged her
sense of her innocencemoved him almost to pity her an innocence he had never understood tillhe had come to the knowledge of it through sin an innocence which shetoo had not understood while she was innocent or before the strangehumiliation of her nature had first come upon her
Then first her soulhad begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned and atender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallorand her eyes humbled and saddened by the dark shame of womanhood
While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been
Might it be in the mysterious ways of spiritual life that her soul atthose same moments had been conscious of his homage
It might be
glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all hisbody
Conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep thetemptress of his villanelle
Her eyes dark and with look of languorwere opening to his eyes
Her nakedness yielded to him radiant warmodorous and lavishlimbed enfolded him like shining cloud enfoldedhim like water with liquid life and like cloud of vapour or likewaters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech symbols ofthe element of mystery flowed forth over his brain
Are you not weary of ardent ways Lure of the fallen seraphim
Tell no more of enchanted days
Your eyes have set mans heart ablaze And you have had your will of him
Are you not weary of ardent ways
Above the flame the smoke of praise Goes up from ocean rim to rim
Tell no more of enchanted days
Our broken cries and mournful lays Rise in one eucharistic hymn
Are you not weary of ardent ways
While sacrificing hands upraise The chalice flowing to the brim
Tell no more of enchanted days
And still you hold our longing gaze With languorous look and lavish limb
Are you not weary of ardent ways
Tell no more of enchanted days
What birds were they
He stood on the steps of the library to look atthem leaning wearily on his ashplant
They flew round and round thejutting shoulder of house in Molesworth Street
The air of the lateMarch evening made clear their flight their dark darting quiveringbodies flying clearly against the sky as against limphung cloth ofsmoky tenuous blue
He watched their flight bird after bird dark flash swerve aflutter of wings
He tried to count them before all their dartingquivering bodies passed six ten eleven and wondered were they oddor even in number
Twelve thirteen for two came wheeling down fromthe upper sky
They were flying high and low but ever round and roundin straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to rightcircling about temple of air
He listened to the cries like the squeak of mice behind the wainscota shrill twofold note
But the notes were long and shrill and whirringunlike the cry of vermin falling third or fourth and trilled asthe flying beaks clove the air
Their cry was shrill and clear and fineand falling like threads of silken light unwound from whirring spools
The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mothers sobs andreproaches murmured insistently and the dark frail quivering bodieswheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of thetenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mothersface
Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch hearing theirshrill twofold cry watching their flight
For an augury of good orevil
phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew through his mind and thenthere flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from Swedenborg on thecorrespondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how thecreatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times andseasons because they unlike man are in the order of their life andhave not perverted that order by reason
And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight
The colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple andthe ashplant on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of anaugur
sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of hisweariness fear of symbols and portents of the hawklike man whosename he bore soaring out of his captivity on osierwoven wings ofThoth the god of writers writing with reed upon tablet andbearing on his narrow ibis head the cusped moon
He smiled as he thought of the gods image for it made him think of abottlenosed judge in wig putting commas into document which heheld at arms length and he knew that he would not have remembered thegods name but that it was like an Irish oath
It was folly
But was itfor this folly that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayerand prudence into which he had been born and the order of life out ofwhich he had come
They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of thehouse flying darkly against the fading air
What birds were they
Hethought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south
Then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and comingbuilding ever an unlasting home under the eaves of mens houses andever leaving the homes they had built to wander
Bend down your faces Oona and Aleel
gaze upon them as the swallow gazes Upon the nest under the eave before He wander the loud waters
soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memoryand he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fadingtenuous sky above the waters of oceanic silence of swallows flyingthrough the seadusk over the flowing waters
soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowelshurtled noiselessly and fell away lapping and flowing back and evershaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal andsoft low swooning cry and he felt that the augury he had sought in thewheeling darting birds and in the pale space of sky above him had comeforth from his heart like bird from turret quietly and swiftly
Symbol of departure or of loneliness
The verses crooned in the ear ofhis memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of thehall on the night of the opening of the national theatre
He was aloneat the side of the balcony looking out of jaded eyes at the culture ofDublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scenecloths and human dollsframed by the garish lamps of the stage
burly policeman sweatedbehind him and seemed at every moment about to act
The catcalls andhisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from hisscattered fellow students
libel on Ireland
Made in Germany
We never sold our faith
No Irish woman ever did it
We want no amateur atheists
We want no budding buddhists
sudden swift hiss fell from the windows above him and he knew thatthe electric lamps had been switched on in the readers room
He turnedinto the pillared hall now calmly lit went up the staircase andpassed in through the clicking turnstile
Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries
thick book opened atthe frontispiece lay before him on the wooden rest
He leaned back inhis chair inclining his ear like that of confessor to the face ofthe medical student who was reading to him problem from the chesspage of journal
Stephen sat down at his right and the priest at theother side of the table closed his copy of The Tablet with an angrysnap and stood up
Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely
The medical student went onin softer voicePawn to kings fourth
We had better go Dixon said Stephen in warning
He has gone tocomplain
Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity sayingOur men retired in good order
With guns and cattle added Stephen pointing to the titlepage ofCranlys book on which was printed Diseases of the Ox
As they passed through lane of the tables Stephen saidCranly want to speak to you
Cranly did not answer or turn
He laid his book on the counter andpassed out his wellshod feet sounding flatly on the floor
On thestaircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon repeatedPawn to kings bloody fourth
Put it that way if you like Dixon said
He had quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on finger of hisplump clean hand he displayed at moments signet ring
As they crossed the hall man of dwarfish stature came towards them
Under the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven face began to smile withpleasure and he was heard to murmur
The eyes were melancholy as thoseof monkey
Good evening gentlemen said the stubblegrown monkeyish face
Warm weather for March said Cranly
They have the windows openupstairs
Dixon smiled and turned his ring
The blackish monkeypuckered facepursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purredDelightful weather for March
Simply delightful
There are two nice young ladies upstairs captain tired of waitingDixon said
Cranly smiled and said kindlyThe captain has only one love sir Walter Scott
Isnt that socaptain
What are you reading now captain
Dixon asked
The Bride ofLammermoorI love old Scott the flexible lips said think he writes somethinglovely
There is no writer can touch sir Walter Scott
He moved thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in time to hispraise and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his sad eyes
Sadder to Stephens ear was his speech genteel accent low andmoist marred by errors and listening to it he wondered was thestory true and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken framenoble and come of an incestuous love
The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and ever inthe lake lying grey like shield
game of swans flew there and thewater and the shore beneath were fouled with their greenwhite slime
They embraced softly impelled by the grey rainy light the wet silenttrees the shieldlike witnessing lake the swans
They embraced withoutjoy or passion his arm about his sisters neck
grey woollen cloakwas wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fairhead was bent in willing shame
He had loose redbrown hair and tendershapely strong freckled hands
There was no face seen
Thebrothers face was bent upon her fair rainfragrant hair
The handfreckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davins hand
He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin whohad called it forth
His fathers gibes at the Bantry gang leaped outof his memory
He held them at distance and brooded uneasily on hisown thought again
Why were they not Cranlys hands
Had Davinssimplicity and innocence stung him more secretly
He walked on across the hall with Dixon leaving Cranly to take leaveelaborately of the dwarf
Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of little groupof students
One of them criedDixon come over till you hear
Temple is in grand form
Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes
Youre hypocrite OKeeffe he said
And Dixon is smiler
By hellI think thats good literary expression
He laughed slily looking in Stephens face repeatingBy hell Im delighted with that name
stout student who stood below them on the steps saidCome back to the mistress Temple
We want to hear about that
He had faith Temple said
And he was married man too
And all thepriests used to be dining there
By hell think they all had touch
We shall call it riding hack to spare the hunter said Dixon
Tell us Temple OKeeffe said how many quarts of porter have you inyou
All your intellectual soul is in that phrase OKeeffe said Templewith open scorn
He moved with shambling gait round the group and spoke to Stephen
Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium
he asked
Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall his hat thrustback on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care
And heres the wiseacre said Temple
Do you know that about theForsters
He paused for an answer
Cranly dislodged figseed from his teeth onthe point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently
The Forster family Temple said is descended from Baldwin the Firstking of Flanders
He was called the Forester
Forester and Forster arethe same name
descendant of Baldwin the First captain FrancisForster settled in Ireland and married the daughter of the lastchieftain of Clanbrassil
Then there are the Blake Forsters
Thats adifferent branch
From Baldhead king of Flanders Cranly repeated rooting againdeliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth
Where did you pick up all that history
OKeeffe asked
know all the history of your family too Temple said turning toStephen
Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis says about your family
Is he descended from Baldwin too
asked tall consumptive studentwith dark eyes
Baldhead Cranly repeated sucking at crevice in his teeth
Pernobilis et pervetusta familia Temple said to Stephen
The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly
Dixon turned towards him saying in soft voiceDid an angel speak
Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without angerGoggins youre the flamingest dirty devil ever met do you know
had it on my mind to say that Goggins answered firmly
It did noone any harm did it
We hope Dixon said suavely that it was not of the kind known toscience as paulo post futurumDidnt tell you he was smiler
said Temple turning right andleft
Didnt give him that name
You did
Were not deaf said the tall consumptive
Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him
Then with snortof disgust he shoved him violently down the steps
Go away from here he said rudely
Go away you stinkpot
And you area stinkpot
Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his placewith good humour
Temple turned back to Stephen and askedDo you believe in the law of heredity
Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say
askedCranly facing round on him with an expression of wonder
The most profound sentence ever written Temple said with enthusiasmis the sentence at the end of the zoology
Reproduction is thebeginning of death
He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerlyDo you feel how profound that is because you are poet
Cranly pointed his long forefinger
Look at him
he said with scorn to the others
Look at Irelands hope
They laughed at his words and gesture
Temple turned on him bravelysayingCranly youre always sneering at me
can see that
But am as goodas you any day
Do you know what think about you now as compared withmyself
My dear man said Cranly urbanely you are incapable do you knowabsolutely incapable of thinking
But do you know Temple went on what think of you and of myselfcompared together
Out with it Temple
the stout student cried from the steps
Get itout in bits
Temple turned right and left making sudden feeble gestures as hespoke
Im ballocks he said shaking his head in despair
am and knowI am
And admit it that am
Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildlyAnd it does you every credit Temple
But he Temple said pointing to Cranly he is ballocks too likeme
Only he doesnt know it
And thats the only difference see
burst of laughter covered his words
But he turned again to Stephenand said with sudden eagernessThat word is most interesting word
Thats the only English dualnumber
Did you know
Is it
Stephen said vaguely
He was watching Cranlys firmfeatured suffering face lit up now by asmile of false patience
The gross name had passed over it like foulwater poured over an old stone image patient of injuries and as hewatched him he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the blackhair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown
She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across Stephenin reply to Cranlys greeting
He also
Was there not slight flush onCranlys cheek
Or had it come forth at Temples words
The light hadwaned
He could not see
Did that explain his friends listless silence his harsh comments thesudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so oftenStephens ardent wayward confessions
Stephen had forgiven freely forhe had found this rudeness also in himself
And he remembered anevening when he had dismounted from borrowed creaking bicycle to prayto God in wood near Malahide
He had lifted up his arms and spoken inecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees knowing that he stood on holyground and in holy hour
And when two constabulary men had come intosight round bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer towhistle loudly an air from the last pantomime
He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of apillar
Had Cranly not heard him
Yet he could wait
The talk about himceased for moment and soft hiss fell again from window above
Butno other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he hadfollowed with idle eyes were sleeping
She had passed through the dusk
And therefore the air was silent savefor one soft hiss that fell
And therefore the tongues about him hadceased their babble
Darkness was falling
Darkness falls from the air
trembling joy lambent as faint light played like fairy hostaround him
But why
Her passage through the darkening air or the versewith its black vowels and its opening sound rich and lutelike
He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of thecolonnade beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his reveriefrom the students whom he had left and allowed his mind to summon backto itself the age of Dowland and Byrd and Nash
Eyes opening from the darkness of desire eyes that dimmed thebreaking east
What was their languid grace but the softness ofchambering
And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum thatmantled the cesspool of the court of slobbering Stuart
And he tastedin the language of memory ambered wines dying fallings of sweet airsthe proud pavan and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen inCovent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and thepoxfouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that gaily yieldingto their ravishers clipped and clipped again
The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure
They were secret andinflaming but her image was not entangled by them
That was not the wayto think of her
It was not even the way in which he thought of her
Could his mind then not trust itself
Old phrases sweet only with adisinterred sweetness like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of hisgleaming teeth
It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figurewas passing homeward through the city
Vaguely first and then moresharply he smelt her body
conscious unrest seethed in his blood
Yes it was her body he smelt wild and languid smell the tepidlimbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret softlinen upon which her flesh distilled odour and dew
louse crawled over the nape of his neck and putting his thumb andforefinger deftly beneath his loose collar he caught it
He rolled itsbody tender yet brittle as grain of rice between thumb and fingerfor an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would itlive or die
There came to his mind curious phrase from Cornelius aLapide which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created byGod with the other animals on the sixth day
But the tickling of theskin of his neck made his mind raw and red
The life of his body illclad ill fed louse eaten made him close his eyelids in suddenspasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodiesof lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell
Yes andit was not darkness that fell from the air
It was brightness
Brightness falls from the air
He had not even remembered rightly Nashs line
All the images it hadawakened were false
His mind bred vermin
His thoughts were lice bornof the sweat of sloth
He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students
Well then let her go and be damned to her
She could love some cleanathlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had blackhair on his chest
Let her
Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket andwas eating it slowly and noisily
Temple sat on the pediment of apillar leaning back his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes
squatyoung man came out of the porch leather portfolio tucked under hisarmpit
He marched towards the group striking the flags with the heelsof his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella
Then raisingthe umbrella in salute he said to allGood evening sirs
He struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with aslight nervous movement
The tall consumptive student and Dixon andOKeeffe were speaking in Irish and did not answer him
Then turningto Cranly he saidGood evening particularly to you
He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again
Cranly who wasstill chewing the fig answered with loud movements of his jaws
It is good evening
The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gentlyand reprovingly
can see he said that you are about to make obvious remarks
Um Cranly answered holding out what remained of the half chewed figand jerking it towards the squat students mouth in sign that he shouldeat
The squat student did not eat it but indulging his special humoursaid gravely still tittering and prodding his phrase with hisumbrellaDo you intend that
He broke off pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig and saidloudlyI allude to that
Um Cranly said as before
Do you intend that now the squat student said as ipso facto orlet us say as so to speak
Dixon turned aside from his group sayingGoggins was waiting for you Glynn
He has gone round to the Adelphito look for you and Moynihan
What have you there
he asked tappingthe portfolio under Glynns arm
Examination papers Glynn answered
give them monthly examinationsto see that they are profiting by my tuition
He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled
said Cranly rudely
suppose you mean the barefootedchildren that are taught by bloody ape like you
God help them
He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt
suffer little children to come unto me Glynn said amiably
bloody ape Cranly repeated with emphasis and blasphemous bloodyape
Temple stood up and pushing past Cranly addressed GlynnThat phrase you said now he said is from the new testament aboutsuffer the children to come to me
Go to sleep again Temple said OKeeffe
Very well then Temple continued still addressing Glynn and ifJesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them allto hell if they die unbaptised
Why is that
Were you baptised yourself Temple
the consumptive student asked
But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to come
Temple said his eyes searching Glynns eyes
Glynn coughed and said gently holding back with difficulty the nervoustitter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every wordAnd as you remark if it is thus ask emphatically whence comesthis thusness
Because the church is cruel like all old sinners Temple said
Are you quite orthodox on that point Temple
Dixon said suavely
Saint Augustine says that about unbaptised children going to hellTemple answered because he was cruel old sinner too
bow to you Dixon said but had the impression that limbo existedfor such cases
Dont argue with him Dixon Cranly said brutally
Dont talk to himor look at him
Lead him home with sugan the way youd lead ableating goat
Temple cried
Thats fine invention too
Like hell
But with the unpleasantness left out Dixon said
He turned smiling to the others and saidI think am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much
You are Glynn said in firm tone
On that point Ireland is united
He struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of thecolonnade
Hell Temple said
can respect that invention of the grey spouse ofSatan
Hell is Roman like the walls of the Romans strong and ugly
But what is limbo
Put him back into the perambulator Cranly OKeeffe called out
Cranly made swift step towards Temple halted stamping his footcrying as if to fowlHoosh
Temple moved away nimbly
Do you know what limbo is
he cried
Do you know what we call notionlike that in Roscommon
Blast you
Cranly cried clapping his hands
Neither my arse nor my elbow
Temple cried out scornfully
And thatswhat call limbo
Give us that stick here Cranly said
He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephens hand and sprang downthe steps but Temple hearing him move in pursuit fled through thedusk like wild creature nimble and fleetfooted
Cranlys heavyboots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and thenreturning heavily foiled and spurning the gravel at each step
His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stickback into Stephens hand
Stephen felt that his anger had another causebut feigning patience touched his arm slightly and said quietlyCranly told you wanted to speak to you
Come away
Cranly looked at him for few moments and askedNow
Yes now Stephen said
We cant speak here
Come away
They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking
The bird callfrom Siegfried whistled softly followed them from the steps of theporch
Cranly turned and Dixon who had whistled called outWhere are you fellows off to
What about that game Cranly
They parleyed in shouts across the still air about game of billiardsto be played in the Adelphi hotel
Stephen walked on alone and out intothe quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maples hotel he stood to waitpatient again
The name of the hotel colourless polished wood andits colourless front stung him like glance of polite disdain
Hestared angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in whichhe imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed incalm
They thought of army commissions and land agents peasantsgreeted them along the roads in the country they knew the names ofcertain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitchedprovincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents
How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over theimaginations of their daughters before their squires begat upon themthat they might breed race less ignoble than their own
And under thedeepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which hebelonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes under treesby the edges of streams and near the poolmottled bogs
woman hadwaited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and offering hima cup of milk had all but wooed him to her bed for Davin had the mildeyes of one who could be secret
But him no womans eyes had wooed
His arm was taken in strong grip and Cranlys voice saidLet us eke go
They walked southward in silence
Then Cranly saidThat blithering idiot Temple
swear to Moses do you know thatIll be the death of that fellow one time
But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered was he thinkingof her greeting to him under the porch
They turned to the left and walked on as before
When they had gone onso for some time Stephen saidCranly had an unpleasant quarrel this evening
With your people
Cranly asked
With my mother
About religion
Yes Stephen answered
After pause Cranly askedWhat age is your mother
Not old Stephen said
She wishes me to make my easter duty
And will you
will not Stephen said
Why not
Cranly said
will not serve answered Stephen
That remark was made before Cranly said calmly
It is made behind now said Stephen hotly
Cranly pressed Stephens arm sayingGo easy my dear man
Youre an excitable bloody man do you know
He laughed nervously as he spoke and looking up into Stephens facewith moved and friendly eyes saidDo you know that you are an excitable man
daresay am said Stephen laughing also
Their minds lately estranged seemed suddenly to have been drawncloser one to the other
Do you believe in the eucharist
Cranly asked
do not Stephen said
Do you disbelieve then
neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it Stephen answered
Many persons have doubts even religious persons yet they overcomethem or put them aside Cranly said
Are your doubts on that point toostrong
do not wish to overcome them Stephen answered
Cranly embarrassed for moment took another fig from his pocket andwas about to eat it when Stephen saidDont please
You cannot discuss this question with your mouth fullof chewed fig
Cranly examined the fig by the light of lamp under which he halted
Then he smelt it with both nostrils bit tiny piece spat it out andthrew the fig rudely into the gutter
Addressing it as it lay he saidDepart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire
Taking Stephens arm he went on again and saidDo you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day ofjudgement
What is offered me on the other hand
Stephen asked
An eternity ofbliss in the company of the dean of studies
Remember Cranly said that he would be glorified
Ay Stephen said somewhat bitterly bright agile impassible andabove all subtle
It is curious thing do you know Cranly said dispassionately howyour mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say youdisbelieve
Did you believe in it when you were at school
bet youdid
did Stephen answered
And were you happier then
Cranly asked softly happier than you arenow for instance
Often happy Stephen said and often unhappy
was someone else then
How someone else
What do you mean by that statement
mean said Stephen that was not myself as am now as had tobecome
Not as you are now not as you had to become Cranly repeated
Let meask you question
Do you love your mother
Stephen shook his head slowly
dont know what your words mean he said simply
Have you never loved anyone
Cranly asked
Do you mean women
am not speaking of that Cranly said in colder tone
ask you ifyou ever felt love towards anyone or anything
Stephen walked on beside his friend staring gloomily at the footpath
tried to love God he said at length
It seems now failed
It isvery difficult
tried to unite my will with the will of God instantby instant
In that did not always fail
could perhaps do thatstillCranly cut him short by askingHas your mother had happy life
How do know
Stephen said
How many children had she
Nine or ten Stephen answered
Some died
Was your father Cranly interrupted himself for an instant andthen said dont want to pry into your family affairs
But was yourfather what is called welltodo
mean when you were growing up
Yes Stephen said
What was he
Cranly asked after pause
Stephen began to enumerate glibly his fathers attributes
medical student an oarsman tenor an amateur actor shoutingpolitician small landlord small investor drinker goodfellow storyteller somebodys secretary something in distillerya taxgatherer bankrupt and at present praiser of his own past
Cranly laughed tightening his grip on Stephens arm and saidThe distillery is damn good
Is there anything else you want to know
Stephen asked
Are you in good circumstances at present
Do look it
Stephen asked bluntly
So then Cranly went on musingly you were born in the lap of luxury
He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technicalexpressions as if he wished his hearer to understand that they wereused by him without conviction
Your mother must have gone through good deal of suffering he saidthen
Would you not try to save her from suffering more even if orwould you
If could Stephen said that would cost me very little
Then do so Cranly said
Do as she wishes you to do
What is it foryou
You disbelieve in it
It is form nothing else
And you will sether mind at rest
He ceased and as Stephen did not reply remained silent
Then as ifgiving utterance to the process of his own thought he saidWhatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of world amothers love is not
Your mother brings you into the world carriesyou first in her body
What do we know about what she feels
Butwhatever she feels it at least must be real
It must be
What areour ideas or ambitions
Why that bloody bleating goatTemple has ideas
MacCann has ideas too
Every jackass going the roadsthinks he has ideas
Stephen who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind thewords said with assumed carelessnessPascal if remember rightly would not suffer his mother to kiss himas he feared the contact of her sex
Pascal was pig said Cranly
Aloysius Gonzaga think was of the same mind Stephen said
And he was another pig then said Cranly
The church calls him saint Stephen objected
dont care flaming damn what anyone calls him Cranly said rudelyand flatly
call him pig
Stephen preparing the words neatly in his mind continuedJesus too seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy inpublic but Suarez jesuit theologian and Spanish gentleman hasapologised for him
Did the idea ever occur to you Cranly asked that Jesus was not whathe pretended to be
The first person to whom that idea occurred Stephen answered wasJesus himself
mean Cranly said hardening in his speech did the idea ever occurto you that he was himself conscious hypocrite what he called thejews of his time whited sepulchre
Or to put it more plainly thathe was blackguard
That idea never occurred to me Stephen answered
But am curious toknow are you trying to make convert of me or pervert of yourself
He turned towards his friends face and saw there raw smile whichsome force of will strove to make finely significant
Cranly asked suddenly in plain sensible toneTell me the truth
Were you at all shocked by what said
Somewhat Stephen said
And why were you shocked Cranly pressed on in the same tone if youfeel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus was not the son ofGod
am not at all sure of it Stephen said
He is more like son of Godthan son of Mary
And is that why you will not communicate Cranly asked because youare not sure of that too because you feel that the host too may bethe body and blood of the son of God and not wafer of bread
Andbecause you fear that it may be
Yes Stephen said quietly feel that and also fear it
see Cranly said
Stephen struck by his tone of closure reopened the discussion at onceby sayingI fear many things dogs horses firearms the sea thunderstormsmachinery the country roads at night
But why do you fear bit of bread
imagine Stephen said that there is malevolent reality behindthose things say fear
Do you fear then Cranly asked that the God of the Roman catholicswould strike you dead and damn you if you made sacrilegiouscommunion
The God of the Roman catholics could do that now Stephen said
fearmore than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul bya false homage to symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries ofauthority and veneration
Would you Cranly asked in extreme danger commit that particularsacrilege
For instance if you lived in the penal days
cannot answer for the past Stephen replied
Possibly not
Then said Cranly you do not intend to become protestant
said that had lost the faith Stephen answered but not that hadlost selfrespect
What kind of liberation would that be to forsake anabsurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one which isillogical and incoherent
They had walked on towards the township of Pembroke and now as theywent on slowly along the avenues the trees and the scattered lights inthe villas soothed their minds
The air of wealth and repose diffusedabout them seemed to comfort their neediness
Behind hedge of laurela light glimmered in the window of kitchen and the voice of servantwas heard singing as she sharpened knives
She sang in short brokenbarsRosie OGradyCranly stopped to listen sayingMulier cantatThe soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch thedark of the evening with touch fainter and more persuading than thetouch of music or of womans hand
The strife of their minds wasquelled
The figure of woman as she appears in the liturgy of thechurch passed silently through the darkness whiterobed figuresmall and slender as boy and with falling girdle
Her voice frailand high as boys was heard intoning from distant choir the firstwords of woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the firstchanting of the passionEt tu cum Jesu Galilæo erasAnd all hearts were touched and turned to her voice shining like ayoung star shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxyton andmore faintly as the cadence died
The singing ceased
They went on together Cranly repeating in stronglystressed rhythm the end of the refrain And when we are married how happy well be For love sweet Rosie OGrady And Rosie OGrady loves me
Theres real poetry for you he said
Theres real love
He glanced sideways at Stephen with strange smile and saidDo you consider that poetry
Or do you know what the words mean
want to see Rosie first said Stephen
Shes easy to find Cranly said
His hat had come down on his forehead
He shoved it back and in theshadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face framed by the dark andhis large dark eyes
His face was handsome and his body was strongand hard
He had spoken of mothers love
He felt then the sufferingsof women the weaknesses of their bodies and souls and would shieldthem with strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them
Away then it is time to go
voice spoke softly to Stephens lonelyheart bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming toan end
Yes he would go
He could not strive against another
He knewhis part
Probably shall go away he said
Cranly asked
Where can Stephen said
Yes Cranly said
It might be difficult for you to live here now
Butis it that makes you go
have to go Stephen answered
Because Cranly continued you need not look upon yourself as drivenaway if you do not wish to go or as heretic or an outlaw
There aremany good believers who think as you do
Would that surprise you
Thechurch is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas
It is the whole mass of those born into it
dont know what you wishto do in life
Is it what you told me the night we were standingoutside Harcourt Street station
Yes Stephen said smiling in spite of himself at Cranlys way ofremembering thoughts in connexion with places
The night you spent halfan hour wrangling with Doherty about the shortest way from Sallygap toLarras
Cranly said with calm contempt
What does he know about theway from Sallygap to Larras
Or what does he know about anything forthat matter
And the big slobbering washingpot head of him
He broke into loud long laugh
Stephen said
Do you remember the rest
What you said is it
Cranly asked
Yes remember it
To discoverthe mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could express itself inunfettered freedom
Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgement
Cranly repeated
But you are not free enough yet to commit asacrilege
Tell me would you rob
would beg first Stephen said
And if you got nothing would you rob
You wish me to say Stephen answered that the rights of property areprovisional and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful torob
Everyone would act in that belief
So will not make you thatanswer
Apply to the jesuit theologian Juan Mariana de Talavera whowill also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully killyour king and whether you had better hand him his poison in goblet orsmear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow
Ask me rather would Isuffer others to rob me or if they did would call down upon themwhat believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm
And would you
think Stephen said it would pain me as much to do so as to berobbed
see Cranly said
He produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth
Then he said carelesslyTell me for example would you deflower virgin
Excuse me Stephen said politely is that not the ambition of mostyoung gentlemen
What then is your point of view
Cranly asked
His last phrase sour smelling as the smoke of charcoal anddisheartening excited Stephens brain over which its fumes seemed tobrood
Look here Cranly he said
You have asked me what would do and whatI would not do
will tell you what will do and what will not do
will not serve that in which no longer believe whether it callitself my home my fatherland or my church and will try to expressmyself in some mode of life or art as freely as can and as wholly asI can using for my defence the only arms allow myself tousesilence exile and cunning
Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him backtowards Leeson Park
He laughed almost slily and pressed Stephens armwith an elders affection
Cunning indeed
he said
Is it you
You poor poet you
And you made me confess to you Stephen said thrilled by his touchas have confessed to you so many other things have not
Yes my child Cranly said still gaily
You made me confess the fears that have
But will tell you alsowhat do not fear
do not fear to be alone or to be spurned foranother or to leave whatever have to leave
And am not afraid tomake mistake even great mistake lifelong mistake and perhapsas long as eternity too
Cranly now grave again slowed his pace and saidAlone quite alone
You have no fear of that
And you know what thatword means
Not only to be separate from all others but to have noteven one friend
will take the risk said Stephen
And not to have any one person Cranly said who would be more than afriend more even than the noblest and truest friend man ever had
His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature
Hadhe spoken of himself of himself as he was or wished to be
Stephenwatched his face for some moments in silence
cold sadness was there
He had spoken of himself of his own loneliness which he feared
Of whom are you speaking
Stephen asked at length
Cranly did not answer
Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my revolt
He had his grand manner on
supple and suave
Attacked me on thescore of love for ones mother
Tried to imagine his mother cannot
Told me once in moment of thoughtlessness his father was sixtyonewhen he was born
Can see him
Strong farmer type
Pepper and saltsuit
Square feet
Unkempt grizzled beard
Probably attends coursingmatches
Pays his dues regularly but not plentifully to Father Dwyer ofLarras
Sometimes talks to girls after nightfall
But his mother
Veryyoung or very old
Hardly the first
If so Cranly would not havespoken as he did
Old then
Probably and neglected
Hence Cranlysdespair of soul the child of exhausted loins
March morning
Thought this in bed last night but was too lazyand free to add to it
Free yes
The exhausted loins are those ofElizabeth and Zacchary
Then he is the precursor
Item he eats chieflybelly bacon and dried figs
Read locusts and wild honey
Also whenthinking of him saw always stern severed head or death mask as ifoutlined on grey curtain or veronica
Decollation they call it in thefold
Puzzled for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate
What do Isee
decollated precursor trying to pick the lock
March night
Soul free and fancy free
Let the dead burythe dead
And let the dead marry the dead
In company with Lynch followed sizeable hospital nurse
Lynchs idea
Dislike it
Two lean hungry greyhounds walking after aheifer
Have not seen her since that night
Sits at thefire perhaps with mammas shawl on her shoulders
But not peevish
Anice bowl of gruel
Wont you now
Began with discussion with my mother
Subject BVM
Handicapped by my sex and youth
To escape held up relations betweenJesus and Papa against those between Mary and her son
Said religionwas not lyingin hospital
Mother indulgent
Said have queer mindand have read too much
Not true
Have read little and understood less
Then she said would come back to faith because had restless mind
This means to leave church by backdoor of sin and reenter through theskylight of repentance
Cannot repent
Told her so and asked forsixpence
Got threepence
Then went to college
Other wrangle with little round head rogues eyeGhezzi
This time about Bruno the Nolan
Began in Italian and ended inpidgin English
He said Bruno was terrible heretic
said he wasterribly burned
He agreed to this with some sorrow
Then gave merecipe for what he calls risotto alla bergamasca
When he pronouncesa soft he protrudes his full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel
Has he
And could he repent
Yes he could and cry two round roguestears one from each eye
Crossing Stephens that is my Green remembered that his countrymenand not mine had invented what Cranly the other night called ourreligion
quartet of them soldiers of the ninetyseventh infantryregiment sat at the foot of the cross and tossed up dice for theovercoat of the crucified
Went to library
Tried to read three reviews
She is not outyet
Am alarmed
About what
That she will never be out again
Blake wrote wonder if William Bond will die For assuredly he is very illAlas poor William
was once at diorama in Rotunda
At the end were pictures of bignobs
Among them William Ewart Gladstone just then dead
Orchestraplayed Willie we have missed youA race of clodhoppers
March morning
troubled night of dreams
Want to get them offmy chest
long curving gallery
From the floor ascend pillars of dark vapours
It is peopled by the images of fabulous kings set in stone
Theirhands are folded upon their knees in token of weariness and their eyesare darkened for the errors of men go up before them for ever as darkvapours
Strange figures advance as from cave
They are not as tall as men
One does not seem to stand quite apart from another
Their faces arephosphorescent with darker streaks
They peer at me and their eyesseem to ask me something
They do not speak
This evening Cranly was in the porch of the libraryproposing problem to Dixon and her brother
mother let her childfall into the Nile
Still harping on the mother
crocodile seized thechild
Mother asked it back
Crocodile said all right if she told himwhat he was going to do with the child eat it or not eat it
This mentality Lepidus would say is indeed bred out of your mud bythe operation of your sun
And mine
Is it not too
Then into Nile mud with it
Disapprove of this last phrase
Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnstons Mooneyand OBriens
Rather lynxeyed Lynch saw her as we passed
He tellsme Cranly was invited there by brother
Did he bring his crocodile
Ishe the shining light now
Well discovered him
protest did
Shining quietly behind bushel of Wicklow bran
Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlaters church
Hewas in black sweater and had hurley stick
Asked me was it true Iwas going away and why
Told him the shortest way to Tara was viaHolyhead
Just then my father came up
Father polite andobservant
Asked Davin if he might offer him some refreshment
Davincould not was going to meeting
When we came away father told me hehad good honest eye
Asked me why did not join rowing club
Ipretended to think it over
Told me then how he broke Pennyfeathersheart
Wants me to read law
Says was cut out for that
More mudmore crocodiles
Wild spring
Scudding clouds
Dark stream ofswirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their delicateflowers
Eyes of girls among the leaves
Girls demure and romping
Allfair or auburn no dark ones
They blush better
Certainly she remembers the past
Lynch says all women do
Then she remembers the time of her childhoodand mine if was ever achild
The past is consumed in the present and the present is livingonly because it brings forth the future
Statues of women if Lynch beright should always be fully draped one hand of the woman feelingregretfully her own hinder parts
April later
Michael Robartes remembers forgotten beauty andwhen his arms wrap her round he presses in his arms the lovelinesswhich has long faded from the world
Not this
Not at all
desire topress in my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world
Faintly under the heavy night through the silence of thecity which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as weary loverwhom no caresses move the sound of hoofs upon the road
Not so faintlynow as they come near the bridge and in moment as they pass thedarkened windows the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow
Theyare heard now far away hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gemshurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journeys endwhatheartbearing what tidings
Read what wrote last night
Vague words for vagueemotion
Would she like it
think so
Then should have to like italso
That tundish has been on my mind for long time
lookedit up and find it English and good old blunt English too
Damn the deanof studies and his funnel
What did he come here for to teach us hisown language or to learn it from us
Damn him one way or the other
John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned from the west ofIreland
European and Asiatic papers please copy
He told us he met anold man there in mountain cabin
Old man had red eyes and short pipe
Old man spoke Irish
Mulrennan spoke Irish
Then old man and Mulrennanspoke English
Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars
Old mansat listened smoked spat
Then saidAh there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of theworld
fear him
fear his redrimmed horny eyes
It is with him muststruggle all through this night till day come till he or lie deadgripping him by the sinewy throat till Till what
Till he yield tome
mean no harm
Met her today point blank in Grafton Street
The crowdbrought us together
We both stopped
She asked me why never camesaid she had heard all sorts of stories about me
This was only to gaintime
Asked me was writing poems
About whom
asked her
Thisconfused her more and felt sorry and mean
Turned off that valve atonce and opened the spiritualheroic refrigerating apparatus inventedand patented in all countries by Dante Alighieri
Talked rapidly ofmyself and my plans
In the midst of it unluckily made suddengesture of revolutionary nature
must have looked like fellowthrowing handful of peas into the air
People began to look at us
She shook hands moment after and in going away said she hoped Iwould do what said
Now call that friendly dont you
Yes liked her today
little or much
Dont know
liked her andit seems new feeling to me
Then in that case all the rest allthat thought thought and all that felt felt all the restbefore now in fact give it up old chap
Sleep it off
The spell of arms and voices the white arms of roads their promise ofclose embraces and the black arms of tall ships that stand against themoon their tale of distant nations
They are held out to say We arealonecome
And the voices say with them We are your kinsmen
And theair is thick with their company as they call to me their kinsmanmaking ready to go shaking the wings of their exultant and terribleyouth
Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in order
Sheprays now she says that may learn in my own life and away from homeand friends what the heart is and what it feels
So be it
Welcome life
go to encounter for the millionth time the realityof experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreatedconscience of my race
Old father old artificer stand me now and ever in goodstead
