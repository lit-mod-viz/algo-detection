PLOT GENIE

This special Suppltzmentary Formula and Index may be said to be 1111:
twin of the 0113 which foliows. I say this because Qur cantact With the
many magazine. authors Who write for the pulp paper periodicals has shown
us that the majority of thosc who write ActiGnIAdvcnture Stories are also
interested in Detectivvlvlystexy ﬁction.

The caj-mpﬂation and preparation of this Formula and Index has err
tailed a tremendous amount of research by Mr. Hill and our staff and in
prasmting‘ it to the professional author I feel that we are offering a method
which is a great time and labor savar as well as a thought stimulator. T0
the beginner or new writer it is a complete: education in the writing of a
certain type 0f ShOl't story and without a doubt worth many times), the:
amount of any price for which it will ever be sold

While this special Fermula and Index, as well as the one which follows,
has been compiled at the insistent demand of many professional magazine
authors, this by no means detracts from its value to the student writer.
Becausa Of its simplicity and directness, a charaaterizstic quality 111 all of
our publications, I cannot see how anyone W110 possesses. a creative imag
