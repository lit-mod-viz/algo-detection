INTRODUCTION 11

Since Nerval, no one has treated, in Gozzi’s genuine-
ly technical manner, of the secrets of invention, unless
it be relevant to mention in this connection Sarcey’s
celebrated theory of the “scéne—é-faire," a theory
in general but ill comprehended by an age which dreads
didacticism,—that is to say, dreads any serious reﬂec-
tion upon art ; some intimate notes of Dumas ﬁls which
were published against his wishes, if my youthful
memories are correct, in the “Temps” some years ago,
and which set forth that double plot of Comeille and
Racine, a heroine disputed by two heroes, and a hero
disputed by two heroines ; and, lastly, some works here
and there by Valin, upon composition. And that is all.
absolutelyiall.

Finally, in Qgiet; I rediscovered the thirty-six situa-
tions, as Gozzi doubtless possessed them, and as the
reader will ﬁnd them in the following pages; for there
were indeed, as he had indicated, thirty-six categories
which I had to formulate in order to distribute ﬁtly
among them the innumerable dramas awaiting classi-
ﬁcation. There is, I hasten to say, nothing mystic or
cabalistic about this particular number; it might per-
haps be possible to choose one a triﬂehigher or lower,
but this one I consider the most gccurate.

Now, to this declared fact that there are no more
than thirty-six dramatic" situations, is attached a
singular corollary, the discovery that there are in life
but thirty-six emotions. A maximun of thirty-six emo-
tions,—and therein we have all the savor of existence;
there we have the unceasing ebb and ﬂow which ﬁlls
human history like tides of the sea ;which is,iiideed,the
very substance of history, since it is the substance of
humanity itself, in the shades of African forests as

*I have replaced the word “tragic", used in the quotation,
with "dramatic”. Those familiar with Goethe know that for
him—one of the “classic” Germans—the two terms were synony-
mous in this passage.
