TWENTY—FOURTH SITUATION
RIVALRY 0F ISUPERIOR AND INFERIOR
(The Superior Rival; the Inferior Rival; the Object)

I would have preferred to make of this and the
following (Adultery) a single situation. The differ-
ence lies in a contract or a ceremony, of variable im-
portance according to the milieu, and which in any case
does not materially change the dramatic emotions
springing from the love contest; even this difference
becomes quite imperceptible in polygamous societies
(Hindu drama). Thus I would rather have created but
one independent situation, of which the other should
be a nuance. But I fear I should be accused of purpose-
ly compressing modem works into the smallest pos-
sible number of categories, for the two which we are
now to analyze contain the major part of them.

We have already remarked that between “Hatred of
Kinsmen" and “Rivalry of Kinsmen” the sole difference
lies in the fact that in the latter there is embodied in
human form the Object of dispute, the “casus belli."
For the same reason we may bring together the sit-
uations “Rivalry of Superior and Inferior,” “Adultery,"

'and even “Murderous Adultery,” and distinguish them
from all the situations which portray struggle pure
and simple, (V. VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XXX, XXXI).
However, the beloved Object will more naturally
appear in the present cases of sentimental rivalry than
she could jn the “Rivalry of Kinsmen," and nowhere
does a more favorable opportunity present itself to the
dramatic poet for portraying his ideals of love.
