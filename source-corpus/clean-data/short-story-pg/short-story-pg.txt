The Importance of Literary Style

Were it not for the clever literary style employed in the writing of a great many short-short stories which have been accepted and published they would have qualified as ordinary short-stories only. What is meant by this is that great many clever writers have taken what would otherwise have been an ordinary short-story and by either purposely misleading the reader with dialogue which has a double meaning or by withholding important facts until the last paragraph, they have made it into a "Short-Short" story. In other words, they have given it what we call the "trick" ending which is a big dramatic punch or surprise to the reader. In some of the short-short stories which have been accepted and published the reader is even left in a quandary and is required to supply his own interpretation at the end. In others he is left in a serious and reflective mood with a wealth of food for thought. In practically all of them which are written according to formula there is a surprise in the last paragraph. The majority of those which have been accepted and published are literary gems, or have distinctive features about them which lift them out of the ordinary. I will enumerate a few of these features in order to make myself clear. They are:

In which the dialogue is so clever that it elicits a chuckle or an outright laugh. For example, the last two paragraphs in "The Killer" a story written by Arthur T. Munion and published in LIBERTY, September 21, 1929, a "thumbnail" synopsis of which is number 16 on page 111. The closing paragraphs are as follows:

"Where," he wanted to know, "did you get that wallop?"

"That? Oh, that!" Armstrong assumed a worried look. "It's temper," he whispered. "Beastly thing, Baskerville. Ugh! I see red. Forget I'm human. Growl like a wolf. Grr-r-r. Likely as not to tear a man to ribbons when -- What, going, Baskerville? Well, any other time, you know..."

In which the dialogue is so cleverly written that it portrays a character so clearly that one can almost feel he has known the person. For example, in the story "Pearls" written by Philip Wylie and published in LIBERTY, October 5m 1929, the following paragraphs appear:
"Mr. Bradley's bland eyes became more lifeless and opaque. He said, "Quite."

"Throckmorton of Taine stared at the ceiling. "I thought with three months -- you

could -- er -- assemble something decent. About -- er -- say eighty thousand pounds -- what?"

"Mr. Bradleys fingers lifter and fell. "Quite," he repeated."

The "thumbnail" synopsis of this story is number 4 and appears on page 108.

In which the description is so well-worded that one is immediately transported into the atmosphere of the story, as in the case of "A Helping Hand," by Morton Thompson, which appeared in the October 19, 1929 issue of LIBERTY and the "thumbnail" synopsis of which is number 74 on page 123 of this Index. This is exemplified by the following paragraph:

"Here was her freedom in the magic city. And she had no hob. No money, no friends, no earthly chance of earning any. A chill must blew in from the Battery. Thin soupy rain followed."

The author of this story also reserved a terrific dramatic punch for the very last line wherein he tells us that what was found crumpled in the hand of the suicide victim was the five-dollar bill that he had given her and that it was a counterfeit, thereby leaving great latitude for speculation.

In which the story gets under way so speedily that the interest of the reader is immediately seized in an iron grip, with the result that it is impossible to lay down the magazine without reading the story through. An example of this will be found in "Taken For a Ride." ("Thumbnail" synopsis number 21 on page 112 of Index) and of which the following paragraphs are an illustration.

"Jennings was being taken for a ride. A man sat beside him on the front seat of his car with a gun pressed against his ribs. The gun was in the man's pocket, and was held in his left hand.

"Jennings didn't feel that he had ever done any harm to anybody. True, he as a bootlegger, but he was only a little one, and tried not to sell any poison stuff."

This story was written by William C. Ford, and this clever author not only gets his story under way at the top speed in the first two paragraphs but introduces his main characters in that space also.

In which the action of the character is so cleverly described that he is made to live and breathe and to be so human that the illusion of knowing him is perfect. As in the story "One Strong Thing," from the June 7, 1930 issue of LIBERTY, written by Carrie Tibbets McCausland, ("Thumbnail" synopsis number 7 on page 109of Index.) The following paragraphs illustrates:

"Ruth stood for a moment looking down at her husband. He looked at her with the eyes of a beaten dog and the grin of a satyr. She dropped quietly to her knees and began unlacing his shoes."

There is also a pathetic punch in this paragraph as it describes the actions of a wife who has decided to desert her husband because of his drinking -- and how her love triumphs over the decision when he comes in a drunk again.

Wherein in just a few words an author tells a whole story so cleverly that the reader sees in retrospect perhaps what has required years to develop in the life of a character. An example of this is contained in the story entitle, "He'd Have Said Goodbye - " by Philip Duganne in the July 5, 1930 issue of LIBERTY. ("Thumbnail" synopsis number 40 on page 116 of Index). I refer to the following paragraph.
"Emmy was a coward. Thirteen years in the state orphanage before old Caleb Ryder took her out to do the housework which his wife could not attend to from her grave, and five years of Fred's bullying were not the stuff to make courage.

This story also contains a number of other very clever paragraphs descriptive of action and atmosphere. We can see the characters in the story move about as if in real life or on the talking picture screen as we read the following paragraph from the same story.

"They searched until sundown -- the house, the barn, the ground. The sear leaves of the cornstalks rustled ominously as men moved among them, and the drunken scarecrows, witnesses, if there had been a crime, to the scene, flapped their straw-stuffed sleeves in the wind as though they shook with dreadful laughter."

In which the author has very cleverly described in just a few words at the end of his story retrospective action or events which explain everything and leave the reader aghast. An illustration of this is contained in the story, "The Perfect Murder," ("Thumbnail" synopsis number 79 on page 124,) written by Roy L. Mangum and published in LIBERT of April 11, 1931. Following is a paragraph:
"But then, Willowville folks don't known to this day that Emily Holden was Mark Melcher's daughter, that Mark had never been married, and that Old Man Fellows was the only human being on earth who knew those things.

In which the author has converted into a short-short story what would have been an ordinary short-story by opening up his action at the most interesting point of the narrative and then five or six paragraphs later describing in retrospect, previous events which would have been uninteresting reading. This was aptly illustrated in "Love 'Em and - " written by John Franklin Fellows and published in LIBERTY on August 15^th^, 1931. ("Thumbnail" synopsis number 59 page 119 Index."

His opening paragraph, which immediately seizes interest, was as follows:

"It was not until the brig West Away had been at sea three days that "Spud" Martin got his chance to kill Jack Wilton. But all the breaks were with him now, "Spud" thought grimly, even the fact that Jack and he had been watch mates for six years.

The retrospect which would have been a very uninteresting opening is contained in the following paragraph which appeared a little more than half way down the first column.

"For six years Spud Martin and Jack Wilton had been watch mates. For six years they had spent their hours ashore in the same haunts, and for six years they had shared their confidences and ideas. And Spud, with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimates always show for the other, had studied Jack until he knew him better than he did himself. That was why Spud knew what Jack's attitude toward Elsie Saunders must be, even though Jack had become taciturn and avoided looking Spud in the eye."

All the way through these short-short stories one finds beautifully written lines which aptly describes atmosphere, action, and character. The following are a few examples:

"The old woman looked like a piece of crumpled brown wax lying there against a high ruffled pillow."

"The Doctor picked up the scalpel. He nodded to the curly-haired nurse. She placed the cone back on Addington's face. Drip. Drip. Dip.

"But she didn't hear what he was saying, for intuitively she placed that tone. It struck the cunning note of the conversationally intimate."

"Gingerly he seated himself upon the straight chair beside the desk and even as he did so the smiling mask dropped from Tim's face."

"The dismal spectre bowed again, settled himself wearily upon the cushions and placed the tin box between us."

"How could I know? What does any woman know about the man she marries? She begins with faith, she continues with hope and unless she divorces him she stays by him through charity." (Philosophy well put.)

**Analyzing Some Successful Short-Short Stories **

The publishers of LIBERTY Magazine have very kindly given their permission to reprint in full several of the short-short stories which have been purchased by them and published, and which provide excellent examples of clever plot construction, treatment, description, dialogue or literary style.

In practically every short-short story, there has been displayed by the author an outstanding cleverness in one of these features, and that is what lifts the story out of the class of the ordinary short-story into that of the short-short.

The following is a story which was published in LIBERTY on August 15, 1931, and one of those which I have selected as an example.

LOVE 'EM AND --

By John Franklin Fellows.

It was not until the brig West Away had been at sea three days that "Spud" Martin got his chance to kills Jack Wilton. But all the breaks were with him now, Spud thought grimly, even the fact that Jack and he had been watch mates for six years.

It was nearly dark, and the West Away was running into a blow off Sable Island. "Shorten Sail!" had been the order, and Spud Martin and Jack Wilton were on the yard furling the main T-gallant sail.

The rest of the crew were at their own stations. There would be no one to see the cause of the "accident," no one to prevent its inevitable result.

Spud Martin's usually good natured face looked strained, and his short, stocky muscles worked jerkily as he furled the sail to windward and studied Jack, who was down to leeward furling his side.

A handsome lad, Jack was, Spud thought, but he'd look different after he'd crashed to the deck seventy-five feet below.

Spud Martin pulled his sheath knife and severed the lashing which held the foot rope to the jackstay on his side of the yardarm.

Holding the foot rope in his hands, he watched bleakly as Jack Wilton began working his way in. And the closer Jack came, the greater grew the strain on the rope in Spud's hands.

Spud would have to let go shortly or be catapulted from the yard himself.

For six years Spud Martin and Jack Wilton had been watch mates. For six years they had spent their hours ashore in the same haunts, and for six years they had shared their confidences and ideas. And Spud, with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimates always shows for the other, had studied Jack until he knew him better than he did himself. That was why Spud knew what Jack's attitude toward Elsie Saunders must be, even though Jack had become taciturn and avoided looking Spud in the eye.

Elsie Saunders was a hostess at the Royal Palm Dance Palace on St. Bedolf Street in Boston. Spud had taken one look at her and bought all her dance tickets for the rest of the evening.

Slim and undeniably graceful, with wide-set blue eyes and flaxen curly hair, she seemed an angel to Spud. And in the next few evenings Spud did his best to prove that he was -- well, made of better stuff than his unprepossessing exterior indicated he was. At any rate, Spud looked forward to seeing her after his next voyage.

Of course he didn't mention this unusual fidelity to his watch mate. He knew Jack too well. "Love 'em and leave 'em!" Jack would say scornfully, if not too originally. That was Jack, a reckless and handsome devil who could get away with it. And because Spud had never found a girl worth hanging on to, he had agreed with Jack.

It was different, though, when Spud met Elsie.

Unfortunately, on his next arrival in port, it fell to Spud to stand the anchor watch while the rest of the crew went ashore in the longboat. And when Spud finally got to the Royal Palms Dance Palace late that night, he found Jack dancing with Elsie Saunders.

Spud did not blame Elsie for the obvious fact that she had fallen for Jack.

Who would give a gorilla like himself a second look when Jack was about?

Nor did he blame Jack for cutting in on him. Jack had always grabbed the best girl he saw even if Spud had dated her first.

It had not matter much before. And what was to become of the girls Jack had loved and left hadn't mattered either. But Elsie --

The two watch mates had gone to sea again, and Spud had tried for three days to convince himself that "love 'em and leave 'em" went for Elsie as well as any other girl. He might have succeeded in convincing himself if Jack too had seemed to realize that Elsie was different, if Jack hadn't avoided looking his former chum in the eyes. But Spud had failed, and Jack would pay now.

* * * *

In spite of his straining hands, Spud felt the rope sag beneath Jack's weight. He saw the catlike nervousness with which Jack balanced himself.

Jack was scared! And Spud grinned mirthlessly as Jack's eyes looked into his own for the first time in three days.

"You ain't lost your nerve, Jack?" Spud asked, his voice harshly derisive above the sound of the wind in the rigging.

Jack nodded in the affirmative and grinned wryly. "With good reason, too," he said. "It's something I've been afraid to tell you."

Spud felt the rope biting into his calloused hands. He could hold but a moment longer. "What is it?" he asked indifferently.

"That after all the braggin' I done about lovin 'em and leavin' 'em," Jack blurted out, "I went and done it! I got hitched!"

Spud felt numb. So that was why Jack had been afraid to look him in the eye!

"Come in, quick!" he grated.

Jack, startled at the harsh command, obeyed it instantly, automatically. And as he sprang to the lee rigging, releasing the strain on the foot rope, the foot rope snapped taut. The sudden jerk threw Spud from the yard.

"Be good to her!" Spud yelled, as he hurtled toward the deck below.

The End.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is one of the best examples I have ever seen where, by exercising clever judgment in the "point of attack," or in the manner of opening the story, the author has immediately aroused the interest of the reader in what would probably have been an uninteresting story if treated differently.

You will note that Mr. Fellows with his opening paragraph has jumped right into the action which immediately precedes the climax. The average inexperienced author, and a great many who are not inexperienced, would have begun the story with the later paragraph which is indicated by indentation, and would have probably lost a sale.

In this story, the author first establishes a highly dramatic situation by telling you in the first five lines that one of his characters is out to kill the other one, thereby also establishing a strong thread of suspense, and creating in your mind a desire to know the "Whys and wherefores," or what it is all about. Then, eight paragraphs later, he describes in less than one hundred words the events leading up to the crisis with which he opens the story and presents the entire background and complication, at the same time giving you a history of his characters.

The plot in this story is very ordinary, being nothing more than a situation in which a jealous rival sacrifices himself for the benefit of another man who has a better right to the girl. The climax is not particularly strong, nor novel. It was no doubt the author's manner of telling the story in such a way as to immediately seize the interest of the reader and hold it, that resulted in the sale of this story to LIBERTY.

The next published short-short from LIBERTY which is outstanding and calls for favorable comment was published on May 23, 1931. It follows:

THE HEADSMAN

By Guy Gilpatric

We pulled into Lyon at about midnight, and found that we had twenty minutes to wait. Beth said she felt hungry, so I walked along the platform to one of those little white enameled pushcart buffets that they have in the French railroad stations, and bought a jar of meat pate, some fresh, flaky rolls and a demi of Burgundy.

I was just paying for these when I saw a switch locomotive shunting a flat car into the shed, and coupling it to the rear of our train. On this flat car, lashed by the wheels, was a shiny black wagon such as is used by undertakers when they call around at the house to pick up a job. Sitting under this wagon were two gendarmes, huddled in their cloaks and smoking cigarettes.

I called the buffet boys attention.

"Oh! Why, that is Monsieur Diebler's black wagon!" he exclaimed. "Do you know what is inside that wagon, monsieur? It is the bois de justice -- the guillotine! There was an execution here this morning, and now they are taking it back to Paris. But buy a paper, monsieur, and you will read!"

I bought; and having taken the paper and the food back to the compartment, I started to read aloud.

"Ugh!" Beth interrupted before I was half through. "If you must read such horrors, read them to yourself. I am trying to eat. Please!"

It wasn't the sort of thing to give one an appetite, at that. A certain Madame Lubet, who had paid the plenty of her crime at fourteen minutes after five that morning. Monsieur Deibler, who, it appeared, always attends to these little matters for the Republic, had arrived from Paris with the official guillotine the night before, and had set it up on the cobblestones in the prison yard.

Now in doing this, said the journal, Monsieur Deibler had been gravely at fault. For when the struggling victim was lashed to the table, the apparatus had shifted just enough on the uneven cobbles to cause the knife to jam at -- well at an awkward point. Thus, the job was not exactly neat; in fact, its completion had required a certain amount of hand work by Monsieur Deibler.

"It is deplorable," the newspaper declared, "that the horrors of capital punishment should thus be increased by the blunders of the callous ghouls who are paid to inflict it. We respectfully petition the Minister of Justice to dismiss the man Deibler from the service of the state."

The train was clicking across the switches out of the yards. A shadow fell across us. We turned, and saw a cadaverous figure standing in the door -- a man who wore a long black cloak, and who carried beneath his arm a black tin case about the size and shape of a hatbox. He bowed low.

"Pardon," he said, and his voice was a hoarse croak. "If I may intrude, I will avail myself of this vacant place."

There was nothing for me to say, so I merely nodded, and waved my hand toward the seat beside me.

The dismal specter bowed again, settled himself wearily upon the cushions, and placed the tin box between us.

I glanced at Beth. She was leaning forward from her place in the corner, staring at the thin, ivory-yellow countenance of the newcomer. I caught her eye. She inclined her head slightly, and moved her lips. No sound came from them, but I knew she was saying: "Deibler!"

I had no doubt, of course, that she was right. Here, sitting beside us in the compartment, was the Headsman of France -- he who had this very morning completed with his own man the gruesome job which his apparatus had bungled.

An unpleasant odor became vaguely perceptible, an odor as of cheap perfume mixed with a chemical disinfectant. I had never smelled any embalming fluid, and yet I recognized it at once. I wondered, and yet was afraid to wonder, what was in that tin box...

Monsieur Deibler sighed sepulchrally, and commenced jotting something in a notebook which he rested upon his bony knee. He seemed to be drawing curves and lines.

I glanced surreptitiously over his shoulder.

What he had drawn was profile view of a woman's head, with dotted lines crossing the neck and skull. He studied this diagram in solemn silence and at length. Then, sighing once more, he thrust the notebook into his pocket, and turned to me.

"Monsieur," he said, "pardon the liberty which I take in addressing you. But today, monsieur, I have had great misfortune. My career will be ruined. I ask you, monsieur, did you see this evening's paper? The -- er -- legal news?"

"Yes," I answered, "I did see it, monsieur."

"Ah," he said. "Then you have guessed to what I refer! It is not a matter which ordinarily I would mention before strangers" -- and he bowed to Beth and smiled a wolfish smile -- "before a charming lady."

I don't know exactly what I said, but in any case --

"The fault, if there was a fault, was with the apparatus," he continued. "The affair was entirely beyond human control. Harsh things have been said about me by those in important circles. The name, even of the Minister of Justice has been invoked. Well, I, too, can appeal to Monsieur the Minister! With what I have here." He patted the tin case and chuckled sardonically.

I shuddered, and edged away from him along the seat.

"In the box, monsieur?" I exclaimed, recoiling. "You have it in the box? Ah, pray put it out in the corridor!"

"Oh, no, indeed," he demurred. "It is so precious that I do not want it out of my sight. People are saying that I was forced to cut away -- er -- cut away what was left by hand. But with the contents of this box, monsieur, I hope to be able to convince both the medical authorities and the officials of justice that all such talk is rankest calumny. But see, monsieur!"

He unsnapped a catch and threw open the top of the box. There, with lips purple, cheeks waxen, eyes glassy, and its hair a tangled mass of black, reposed a head!

I heard Beth give that little whispery cry that always means she is about to faint.

"Things went against me today, but now I will appeal to the highest tribunal!" croaked the headsman. "I will set up my apparatus in court, and demonstrate that it could not possibly be as the witnesses and the newspaper have said. Yes, I, Pierre Auguste Renoir Giraudy, the greatest hair-dresser in France, will prove with this model that Suzette Valier, who claims seventy thousand francs damages because my permanent waving machine burned off her hair, is a liar!"

THE END.

One of the first things that impresses the reader of this story is that the author has traveled and knows his locale. His description of French atmosphere is so perfect that the reader is immediately transported into the realm of the story.

Following this, we are immediately interested when he starts to describe gruesome details of an execution by guillotine which has taken place that morning, thereby "planting" the events, or setting the stage, for what it is to follow.

The outstanding feature of this story is the clever manipulation of dialogue and description in such a way as to totally mislead the reader, or rather, to cause the reader to mislead himself by forming the wrong conclusions -- which, by the way, are very natural in this case.

In this story not only is the reader fooled but so are the two main characters, all being lead to believe that the eccentric hair dresser is none other than the equally unusual executioner, and that the tin box contained the gruesome severed head of the executed woman.

In looking back over this story after experiencing the surprise shock and consequent relief in the last paragraph, one cannot find a single instance of where the author has practiced any fraud on the reader. Every bit of dialogue, action, and description is logical and can be accounted for. Of course, the whole story is based on coincidence of the strangest kind, but not upon something that could not happen.

As a short-short story with a surprise twist ending, this is a masterpiece.

The next one which I will analyze was written by a woman, and is high-lighted with clever and sophisticated description and dialogue throughout, besides having a "stinger" in the last line. This story was published in LIBERTY, on April 4, 1931, and follows:

GET YOUR MAN

By Roberta Yates

"I'm glad to see you, Ellen. Of course I am. But I -- I wish you hadn't come to New York."

Julie Andrews looked at her kid sister with troubled eyes.

Ellen looked back with the clear, laughing eyes of eighteen.

"Afraid the big town'll get me? Don't worry. I've learned about life in Freesburg. The men there keep up with the attacks of the times."

"Do they?" Julie asked dryly. "I hoped you'd marry some nice boy there."

"Five nice ones asked me. It's easy to get a man to ask you to be his wife. You just refuse to be anything else."

"So it's that simple."

"Or else run in a rival on him. Depends on cases. I use a couple of systems. Say, you do yourself well, you plutocrat." Ellen surveyed the penthouse living room with its expensive, modernistic furnishings. She looked at Julie's frock, which bore the stamp of Paris.

"You know, Sis, it surprised me when you made good in New York. You're awfully clever to manage all this on a hundred a week and send money home, too."

"I -- I manage."

Fear in Julie's voice an in her averted eyes. Ellen didn't seem to note it.

"Modeling must be nice work -- wearing pretty clothes and all. It isn't hard, is it?"

"No, it isn't hard," Julie said. "But I'm not working now. It's the off season. We're going to the theatre tonight. A friend of mine is bringing a friend of his."

Ellen gave her an athletic hug. "I'm tickled with everything. Remember when you said you'd make a mint of money in New York and marry a millionaire? Well you've made your mint. Have you made your millionaire?"

Julie's smile was strained. "Don't be silly!"

"Millionaires tonight?"

"Whitney Randolph has a bit. Wallie Langford hasn't so much."

"And I suppose he's for me. Oh, you bum!"

Ellen had a grand evening. She gushed and squealed, but now and then her bright eyes rested thoughtfully on Whitney Randolph. She liked him. Oh, A lot! Who wouldn't? He had movie-star looks -- lean and brown, with a crinkly grin. But she didn't like his possessive attitude toward Julie. And Julie -- Well, she let him get away with it.

Wallie Langford was a drab young man. Ellen paid him little attention until she saw him looking at Julie like a dog who yearns for a pat but expects a kick.

"I'm out of luck," Ellen murmured. "You're both in love with Julie."

"But Whit holds the aces," Wally said.

When Julie and Ellen were alone together, Ellen said: "You're crazy about Whitney Randolph, aren't you?"

"I like him," Julie said guardedly.

"Are you engaged to him?"

"No. Oh, no." Julie's lips tightened. "His mother wouldn't let him marry me. She's a snooty dowager."

"The poor worm!" Ellen stormed. "Hasn't he the nerve to marry without his mother's permission? And where'll he find a gorgeouser girl than you?"

"Don't take it so hard, Ellen." Julie tried to be light.

"Julie, you oughtn't to let him thinks he owns you." Julie went scarlet. "You ought to go around with other men. I heard Wallie Langford ask you to dinner tomorrow night. Why don't you go?"

"Wally bores me."

"Whit is going to a debutante dance. I'd show him."

"I'll go," Julie said.

On the next evening Julie departed with a Wallie who was dazed by his good luck. When the door closed behind them, Ellen sprang to the telephone. She gave the number of Whitney Randolph's club and waited nervously while he was paged.

"Hello," he said.

She spoke in a breathless squeak. "This is Ellen, Julie's sister. Oh, Mr. Randolph, can you come over at once? There's something wrong. I can't tell you over the telephone."

When Whitney Randolph arrived, she was still breathless.

"I know I shouldn't butt into Julie's affairs, but I know she loves you. I can't imagine what makes her do such a thing, though I guess every girl wants to get married."

"What are you talking about?"

"I'm telling you. About Julie marrying Wallie Langford. He's been asking her to for ages, but she wouldn't because she loves you. Then she got to thinking what would happen to her when you married a debutante. So Wallie and she went to Greenwich to have dinner, but really to get married."

"Let me get this," Whitney Randolph said hoarsely. "Julie eloped with Wallie Langford? Ellen, are you crazy?"

"I tell you she did."

"I know that road house Wallie goes to in Greenwich," Whitney said.

"Can you stop them?"

Ellen was talking to air. Whitney had gone. She picked up a book and began to read it calmly, but now and again she looked at the clock. At eleven the telephone rang. Central said that Greenwich, Connecticut, was calling. Julie's voice came, shrill with excitement.

"Ellen, I'm married... Who to? Why, to Whitney, of course."

"So he did fall for it," Ellen said.

Julie didn't hear her.

"He dashed in and accused Wallie of eloping with me. Poor Wallie was so surprised. Then Whit literally dragged me out by the hair. He said he didn't give a hoot what his mother said. And I'm so happy."

"Congratulations," said the kid sister. "I'll be getting back to Freesburg, now that you're fixed up."

"Any darned fool could tell from your letters home that you weren't happy, darling, so I came along to help. There's always a way to get your man."

Ellen rang off. "Even if you're idiot enough to be his mistress first," she added.

THE END.

Observe how this author establishes the contrasting characters of these sisters in two paragraphs of less than fifty words. Both are intensely human, and just exactly like girls we all know, although they are so different from each other.

Study the second paragraph which is indented and just observe the dramatic complication that is suggested by thus author in a bit of dialogue between the two girls. We do not have to be told that the older one is involved. Then look at the way she builds up her characters in those five words: "Ellen gave her an athletic hug."

Miss Yates sets her stage and moves her characters about with a vim and snap that is refreshing. She does it with a few words in the paragraphs a sentences which are intended and set in black.

The author then stands you on your head, figuratively speaking, with a last line that takes your breath -- Wow, what a stinger! -- and something to think about! This is one of those six methods of supplying the surprise or trick ending wherein facts which are pertinent to the story are purposely withheld to supply the necessary punch in the last paragraph.

Number Four which follows, and which was one of the first short-shorts to be published in LIBERTY, is outstanding because of two features. It appeared in the October 19, 1929 issue:

A HELPING HAND

By Morton Thompson

It was only a week before her last ten cents had gone for carfare and left her stranded in a downtown park. Around were vague tall buildings Crowds scurried back and forth in front of her. A man stopped to speak, and she looked at him so dully he moved away abashed.

The small figure in the cheap crushed hat, the wrinkled coarse clothing, drooped. Here was money moving around her; here were people working, eating, sleeping, all with cares and happiness of their own. Working in clean offices, in bedlams of department stores.

Here was her freedom in the magic city. And she had no job. No money, no friends, no earthly chance of earning any. A chill mist blew in from the Battery. Thin soupy rain followed.

Through it all, disappointment glued her to the bench motionless. She had long since forgotten to cry. A man came through the park. His thin coat was buttoned close against the soul-dissolving moisture -- a young man in poor clothing, and with a tired face.

He saw the girl. There was something so arresting in the sight of her sitting on the bench alone in the dark, so heedless of the rain beating down on her, that he quickened his steps and planted himself before her.

"What's the matter, girlie?"

She raised a dull, hopeless face. There was no vestige of anything left upon it but hopelessness. He sat down beside her and forgot the weather.

"What's happened to you? You look as if you'd lost your last friend."

"I never had no friends."

The words moved quickly. They were unstressed.

"Aw, say! Come on, now; you don't mean that."

He pit his arm around her. At the touch she gave way; sobbed and sobbed -- gasping noises in an incoherent jumble of words that told the same old old story.

The narrow home life in the narrow upstate town and the ultimate flight to the Big City to show "them." Money going, going, gone at last. Unknown, jostled by the crowds and the bigness, and the final decision that all men's hands were against her.

"And so I come here, and I'd almost finished the course in the night school and I was goin' to get away from that lousy factory and they laughed at me; all of them did -- an' -- an' now lookit me!"

He pointed to a row of newspaper buildings at one end of the park.

"I work there. Here's the address. Come there tomorrow and I'll get you a job."

"Aw, mister, you don't mean it, do you."

"Sure I mean it, kid. I know what it is to be poor, an' come to this town without a nickel and not knowin' anybody. I did it myself. But you'll forget it soon. Wait'll I get you your job and you'll be workin' and you'll tell me some day how funny it was... The world ain't all bad, kid. People don't laugh at you when you get in trouble. Lookit me. First person saw you, I bet, and see how I'm tryin' to help you!"

She could not speak. Things moved so suddenly past. He stood up. In his pockets were a five-dollar bill and two ones, last remnants of a small salary.

His hands moved among the bills, prudence sweeping the fine cloud of altruistic exaltation a little off his mind. Then she looked at him and the animal devotion and relief in her face made him throw off reserve. "Here, kid. Here's a five spot. Get some sleep and get cleaned up, an' I'll see you in the morning."

He was gone. She sat quiet for a moment while her world swam. A clock boomed and the noise loosed her taut nerves. Down on the dripping pavement she sank and sobbed and beat the cold stone. Free again! The world had opened to her! Half mad with joy, she stumbled toward the light of a yawning subway...

In one of the offices in the large newspaper building the next morning, the young man heard his name called. Gangsters had been busy during the night.

"- And go down and get some kind of description, will you?"

"O.K."

Into the squat building he slouched. Somewhere here was the man he was looking for.

The morgue attendant hurried up in time to watch the young man's strange motions. He had backed away from a file of slabs and was leaning one hand upon a table.

His eyes opened incredulously. There on a slab directly in front of him was the girl he had befriended last night in the park. The little fool! After he'd been so decent to her. Talked on all the virtues of humanity and tried to be a friend to her; was ready to lend her a helping hand. Given her his last five-dollar bill even.

The morgue man glanced from one face to the other.

"J'know her?"

The reporter pulled himself together. What the hell! All in a day's work.

"Naw. I seen her some place, I guess."

"Oh! Well, say! She sure was a funny case at that."

The reporter was moving toward the aisles again.

"Yeah?" he flung back over his shoulder.

"Yeah. They brought her in about two-thirty this morning. Drowned herself, she did."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Down by the Battery. Funny thing. They bring her in all wet and dripping and lay her out, an' whaddaya suppose she ad clinched in her hand but --"

"A PICTURE!" finished the young man disgustedly.

"Naw! It was a counterfeit five-dollar bill!"

THE END

Mr. Thompson's description is beautiful, and he gets into a heart-interest situation which grips you before the end of the second paragraph. Just visualize the scene descried in paragraph 2. One almost shivers and experiences the chill mist and thin soupy rain.

Observe how the author intersperses his history or retrospect with interesting action and dialogue which keeps the story moving -- as illustrated in about the 12^th^ paragraph which is indented. Also, observe how cleverly he has handled the continuity of his story, or the changes of time and place, with no apparent break or annoying lapses.

The biggest feature in this story is the climax, or paradoxical ending which leaves the reader aghast and forces him to go back and read the story over again in an effort to discover what could possibly had lead up to its shocking end. In other words, it certainly leaves much food for thought and speculation, and is one of those stories which sticks in one's mind because it leaves unanswered a number of questions.

Why did the girl commit suicide? How did she discover the bill was counterfeit? Was this the straw that broke the camel's back?

This is the type of short-short that O. Henry might have written and it is easy to see why the editor who bought it immediately recognized its merit.

The next story is another written by a woman and, although it contains no startling plot, it has some outstanding merit. It was published in LIBERTY on July 5^th^, 1930.

HE'D HAVE SAID GOODBYE

By Phyllis Duganne

Emmy was awakened by their angry voices in the kitchen below, Fred and Dan Ryder, quarreling more loudly, more fiercely even than usual. She huddled beneath the patchwork quilt, listening. Ever since their father's death, they had quarreled so. Fred wanted the farm to himself; he hated his younger brother, hated Emmy. Until yesterday she had been sick with fear that Dan would go.

Her frightened mouth relaxed, a warmth crept over her thin body. If it hadn't been for Fred's wanting to send her away, Dan might never have loved her. It was only yesterday that that miracle had occurred. Fred had told her to get out, had struck her -- and Dan had come swiftly around the corner of the barn. Had picked up in his strong arms and steadied her trembling.

"Em!" he had said. "Why, Em!" He stared at her, and then held her tightly. "Why, Emmy..." And she had put her lips to his.

The tremulous softness of those young lips was destroyed once more as she pressed them together to stifle a scream. Below, in the kitchen, had sounded the report of a gun.

Emmy was a coward. Thirteen years in the state orphanage before old Caleb Ryder took her out to do the housework which his wife could not attend to from her grace, and five years of Fred's bullying were not the stuff to make courage. For a long time she waited. Then, shaking, she got out of bed and walked down the stairs in her cotton-flannel night-dress.

Fred Ryder stood at the foot of the steps. "Well, what do you want, you little fool?" he demanded.

She wet her lips, trying to speak, her eyes straining to see past him, into the kitchen.

"That damned hound of Dan's ain't going to root up any more land on this farm," said Fred Ryder grimly. His thin lips moved in something like a smile. "Use'm for fertilizer, now." Then his face darkened. "You git back to bed or we'll use you for fert'lizer, too!"

Emmy got back. It seemed hours later that she heard a second shot. She pulled the patchwork up over her head and lay motionless.

The kitchen was empty when she crept downstairs to get breakfast. Then Fred came in from the barn whistling, and sat down at the table.

"Wh-where's Dan?" she whispered.

"Cleared out," he answered shortly. "An' you clear out, too!"

As soon as he was gone, she thrust her thin arms into her dingy sheep-skin coat and started running down the valley. The ground was hard; frost had come early this year, and the wind was cold. The brown stalks of the corn crackled as she brushed against them, and the lank scarecrows who guarded the field seemed to lean toward her, leering.

In half an hour the entire town was in an uproar. That state girl from Ryders' had come crying to old Sheriff Dillingham that Fred Ryder had murdered his brother! The valley road looked like Sunday morning, alive with wagons and Ford cars and people, all moving swiftly, more tensely than ever they moved to worship.

Fred Ryder laughed at them. He and Dan had had a quarrel and Dan had cleared out. He didn't know nor care where the fool had gone. Good riddance, said Fred Ryder, and his eyes rested, with no emotion stronger than contempt, upon Emmy's pale, accusing face. Shots? Of course. A man had a right to shoot a worthless hound, hadn't he? The quarrel had begun over that damned dog.

"Dan wouldn't have gone away 'thout' saying goodbye to me," said Emmy in her thin voice.

Dan's brother looked at her and snorted. "I knew Dan was a fool, but I didn't think he was that much o' a fool!"

Someone laughed. Emmy's voice was scarcely audible, flat, and unaccented. Why had there been two shots?

He'd shot at the hound twice, Fred answered easily. Tense with excitement, the men solemnly exhumed the body of Dan's dog. There was one bullet wound.

Fred shrugged. He was no sharpshooter, that was all. He must have missed the second time. As detectives they were first class farmers, said Fred Ryder.

Two state policemen arrived on motorcycles. The accused murderer became jocular. If he had killed his brother, he suggested pleasantly, there'd probably be a corpse somewhere about.

They searched until sundown -- the house, the barn, the grounds. The sear leaves of the corn stocks rustled ominously as men moved among them, and the drunken scarecrows, witnesses, if there had been a crime, to the scene, flapped their straw-stuffed sleeves in the wind as though they shook with dreadful laughter.

There was no body, and the searchers looked at Emmy curiously. "He'd have said goodbye to me if he'd gone away," she repeated, almost without emphasis.

The sheriff took Fred Ryder home with him that night, and the search recommenced in the morning. They could not find Dan Ryder dead -- but they could not find him alive. Insistent, tireless, the girl Emmy reiterated her statement: "Dean wouldn't've gone away 'thout' sayin' goodbye to me."

"You can't hang a man, Emmy," Sheriff Dillingham told her. "when the victim may be walkin' around on his own two legs."

On the third day, Emmy sat, dry-eyed, paler than ever, watching the searchers. One by one, they were giving up, forming a doubtful group about the sheriff. Emmy's dull eyes closed. They mustn't give up. Once Fred was released and back here, unwatched --

Dan's cat came and rubbed against Emmy's legs, and the girl stroked her absently, her eyes on the men. They mustn't stop searching. The cat was hungry. As Emmy moved across the furrowed field toward the sheriff, it followed her, purring against her skirts, weaving in and out about her thin legs as it had used to do with Dan.

The sheriff shook his head. "Emmy, there's nobody here." The others nodded.

"Dan would've said --" she began again monotonously, and suddenly her thin voice stopped. Her dull eyes became enormous.

Waist-high in the withered corn, a grotesque scarecrow stood before them, its featureless face of bunched tight about its overstuffed body. Dan Ryder's cat rubbed against its flapping trousers, purring loudly, lifting herself up on her hind legs and arching her soft back.

The men looked at Emmy's staring eyes and their blood went cold. Reluctantly the sheriff stepped forward and lifted the ragged hat. The packed straw slid down, and the thing lurched sideways as the sheriff snatched away his trembling hand.

"He'd have said goodbye to me," whispered Emmy dully.

THE END.

This is another example of where the author has opened the story with interesting action, reserving the historic description of characters and situations until some paragraphs later. Like THE HEADSMAN, this story also has a gruesome element, which a great many people like, perhaps because they enjoy being shocked.

Observe how this author has crowded a whole life story of one of her principal characters into one interesting paragraph of less than fifty words, and how she has jumped from the present to the past and back again with no apparent break. Here she not only gives a perfect description of the character but of her past as well while at the same time keeping the action in the story moving. Take a look at the second paragraph which is indented, and observe how this young woman indulges in a bit of realistic, but brief, description which projects perfect illusion for anyone who has ever walked through a corn field on a winter day. It is the ability to observe and describe such apparently trivial things as the rustling of corn stalks and the flapping of the straw-stuffed sleeves of the scarecrow in the wind that differentiates the seasoned writer from the amateur.

A strong thread of suspense is maintained throughout in this story and the surprise climax is heightened by the simple introduction of a cat which leads to a gruesome discovery. The ending of this story is on a par with the ending of that famous French story in which a sculptor conceals the body of the victim of his crime by covering it with plaster and mounting it in an art gallery.

Another outstanding feature in this story is the pathetic faith of the girl and her insistent moaning, which is expressed in the last line.

The last of this series which I have selected for illustration and comment was published in LIBERTY on May 24, 1930 and follows:

ROUND HEELS

By Houston Day

John Addington closed his eyes. The nurse with the curly hair was rubbing his face with vaseline. Then she covered his mouth and nose with a cone.

"Breathe deeply."

Obediently Addington inhaled the sweet fumes. He wondered how badly he was hurt. What was the doctor going to do to him? But even before he could begin to answer his own questions he realized he was suffocating.

He struggled. Fought to unclasp his hands. He wanted air. Again, distantly, he heard the nurse.

"A deep breath... Now... Again... Again."

Addington obeyed. Magically the feeling of distress passed. He dreamed. Memories flooded his mind in flashing pictures.

He saw himself as he knocked at Evelyn Hayes' apartment on Grove Street. Then, with scarcely an interval, he was inside.

His face tingled. She had slapped him. Bill Walsh had said she had round feels. Bill was wrong. But Bill Walsh wasn't usually mistaken. He was a good promoter.

He saw himself with Bill at the hotel in the Adirondacks. They were vacationing together. He saw the lake. From their rowboat it stretched in a calm expanse of shimmering blue to the shore, where the shadows of the fir trees turned its color to the black of molten tar.

They were in the water struggling. It was cold. Like melted ice. Their boat, bottom up, was slippery with moss. There was nothing to grasp. He cried out. Addington knew he was drowning. The finality of death terrified him. He saw Bill's distorted face. His hair was hanging in sodden locks. Bill was careful of his hair. He wore it long. Brushed straight back. He heard voices. Welcome voices. A hand reached over and grasped him. They were saved.

Now he was in the city. At Evelyn's apartment. She had slapped him again, only two night before, but he had gone back. He really liked her now. Bill was wrong. She wasn't that kind.

Evelyn was weeping. She had lost her job.

"I don't know what I'll do."

He pillowed her head on his shoulder.

"But Baby, why worry, when you have me?"

But Evelyn was despondent. She dabbed at her eyes.

"I'll have to give up the apartment."

He held her closer. Tenderly. Then he drained his glass. The grin smelled like anti-freeze compound. But it glowed pleasantly in his stomach.

"I'll tell you what, dearest. If you don't find something by the first, we'll take a stroll down to the Municipal Building and get married. What do you say?"

Evelyn said no. Said it emphatically and unequivocally. She didn't want to be tied down to a husband, a radio, and a vacuum cleaner.

But the alcohol had sharpened his perception. Evelyn was too positive. He didn't believe her. He became more cautious. He had already said too much. What the devil did he want to get married for, anyway?

The gin began to lose its effect. There was no glow now. Instead, each succeeding glass seemed to hit him dully on the back of his neck. He wanted to go home. He felt dull and stupid. Tired, too. He would have a headache in the morning.

Evelyn leaned closer.

"Don't go just yet. I'm so lonesome and blue."

Three days later they were married.

The doctor picked up the scalpel. He nodded to the curly-haired nurse. She placed the cone back on Addington's face.

Drip. Drip. Drip.

Addington' dream pictures became shorter. More vivid. More fantastic. He was in the army. A German lunged at him with a bayonet. He parried -- jabbed. The German was Bill Walsh. But he had a French rifle. His bayonet was a yard long. He leered and said:

"She's got round heels!"

Then he felt Walsh's bayonet pierce his body. He screamed. Walsh was standing over him. He plunged the bayonet in again. And again. Each time the pain became more intense. Why didn't it kill him? He couldn't move. Couldn't squirm out of the way.

The scene faded. He was in an airplane. Bill Walsh was the pilot. They soared through misty clouds. He felt the vibrations of the propeller, but there was no noise.

Then he was falling. Falling. Falling through space. Bill had dumped him out. Where was his parachute? Frantically he searched for the cord. It wasn't there. But had a parachute. He knew it. He twisted his body in the air.

Beneath him the ground rushed up. It was just like he had read. He saw a telephone pole. It had a sharpened point. He was going to strike it. He cried out.

The nurse looked at the doctor. He nodded. She opened a second can. Drip. Drip. Drip.

Another dream. He was at the office. He knew he had been right. But the boss was insultingly emphatic in his criticism.

"And if you don't like it, you know what you can do!"

His employer wore his familiar, baggy suit, but his face was that of Bill Walsh. Addington tried to justify himself for quitting, as he ascended the steps to his apartment.

He unlocked the door. And then again he saw Bill Walsh. He felt a different pain -- a stunning, rending pain, but he did not cry out. How funny they looked. Bill's coat was hung over a chair. There was revolver, too.

He saw himself shooting. He hardly recognized the pale, angry face as his own.

"Don't!" screamed Evelyn. "Oh, don't!"

She should have kept quiet. He turned the gun toward her and pressed the trigger.

Then there were policemen. He had fired. They shot back. He couldn't feel their bullets. Except when he started to run. Then they stabbed sharply. Bill had said she had round heels. He must have known...

He opened his eyes. He felt deathly sick.

"My God! What a nightmare!"

The curly-haired nurse looked like a friendly, sympathetic little thing. He'd tell her about it. He caught her eyes. She bent nearer. He smiled drunkenly.

The nurse looked at him quizzically. Well, he would have to know sooner or later, so why not now while his senses were dulled by the anaesthetic?

"You did," she said.

THE END

This author adopts a novel literary style by opening his story in the operating room of a hospital and while he describes a scene that is tragically familiar to anyone who has ever witnessed or experienced a surgical operation, he intersperses retrospect which explains all that has gone before without in the least slowing up the story or interfering with the thread of suspense. The result is that by the time one has reached the climax, all kinds of speculations are being indulged in. there is one particular paragraph which I have indented in this story that strikes one more forcibly than all others -- with the exception of the last line, of course. Look at the condensed drama in that paragraph which ends with the words "Drip. Drip. Drip." It gives me a chill every time I read it.

Of all the short-short stories I have read, I believe that there is more punch contained in four words in this one than any of them. I refer to the last line which deals one a "knock out" blow and tells us that not all of the hallucinations which John Addington experienced while under the anaesthetic were unreal, and that he had murdered his wife and his best friend while in a jealous rage.

A study and analysis of the following "thumbnail" synopses of one hundred and twenty-eight of the most outstanding short-short stories published in LIBERTY and COLLIER'S over a period of two years will enable the student to make some interesting conclusions. Besides this it gives one a "cross-sectional" idea of the type of stories that seem to be the most popular.

The cameramen are rewarded instead of being fired.
