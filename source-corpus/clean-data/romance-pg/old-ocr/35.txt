PLOT GENIE ROMAN CE

The Genie operator wﬂl ﬁnd in this Index Book, a list of nine types
of supporting characters and three lists of trait combinations. The pure
pose of employing these two operations in this Formula is to require the
author to make a study of characterization so as to be able to properly
delineate the same in the supporting character which is suggested by the
Plot Genie.

It is intended that the author carefully observe the combinations of
traits Which are suggested by the Plot Genie for the supporting character,
also chosen by the device, and to bear the same in mind When writing in
action and dialogue for such characters. He should also consider not only
the reactions of such supporting character and of all the other characters
in the story to the situations in which they are placed, but the eﬁ'ect that
will result on the progress of the story plot itself. Characterization 1's cerr
tainly as important in a great many stories as the plot, and in some, it is
more 50. Consequently, a great deal of serious thought should be given
to it and much practice indulged in it.
