Operation 1

THE MURDER

Following are three lists which are to be used in connection with the
Detective-Mystery murder story. Operation No. 1 in our Formula requires
the use of all three of them and tell us who the victim is, where the
body was found, and the apparent method that was used to commit the
murder.

We should bear in mind then that it is necessary to dial three times or
three numbers for this operation. The answer for the first one should be
taken from List A, the second from List B, and the third from List C.

Where a repetition appears in any of these lists, it has been done
purposely in order to confine the lists to the most colorful material
possible, bearing in mind that this Formula and Index is not designed to
supply the plot for the so-called "true detective story but for the
scientific and modern detective mystery story.

**THE OUTSTANDING CLUE IS**

The following list provides the author with one or more clues which may
be introduced early in the story as pointing to the soliton of the
crime. These may be used in connection with the murder mystery or any of
the other crime.

In order to complicate the story one may use more than one of these
clues if desired but they should be obtained by dialling the Robot and
not arbitrarily selected from the list.

It will be observed that following the list of clue is another list of
180 objects, any one or more of which may be found at the scene of the
crime and also prove to be a clue, whether false or not.

The author may dial one or more clues from List A and one or more from
List B if desired. The purpose is to leave all possible latitude to the
story writer in the operation of this formula. Some authors may be
satisfied with dialling out a single clue from each list while others
will want to complicate matters by introducing a multiplicity of clues.

OPERATION 8.

**THE GUILTY ONE IS **

This list provides the author with a description of the guilty party. It
will be observed that there are a number of repetitions ad these have
been made purposely. One of the rules in writing the modern scientific
detective-mystery story is that not only the victim but the guilty
person also must be some colorful character and not just an ordinary
person or criminal. Particularly should the guilty person be one who
would not be ordinarily suspected.

In as much as there are 180 numbers on the Robot disc, it was necessary
to make repetitions on this list in order to confine it to colorful
characters. It should be borne in mind that the guilty person, whoever
he or she develops to be, must have been on the scene from the beginning
of the story and possibly has been considered as a suspect. This is one
of the cardinal principles which must be observed as it is not
permissible to introduce such a character at or near the end of the
story.
