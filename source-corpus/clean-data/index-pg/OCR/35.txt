(7) Just because a plot assignment given by the Genie looks impossible
or diﬁicult. do not discard it. but for your own satisfaction proceed to work
it out until you have created a plot embracing the material at hand. Many

Six Problems Lists

It will be observed that there are in the index six lists of “Problems,”
each canraining 180. Therefore, on the fourth operation, or the selection of
a problem, the fuilawing rule should be observed as a means of determining
Which of the six lists of "Problems" Will be used: TURN THE DISC AGAIN
UNTIL A NUMBER ENDING IN 1, 2, 3, ‘9', 5, or 6 APPEARS, AND
LET THAT NUEVIBER INDICATE WHICH OF THE SIX PROBLEM
LISTS TO USE. For instance, the number 152 would indicate that “Lisc 2”
is to be used; or, “List 5" would be used if the number 95 shows in the slot,
and so on.
