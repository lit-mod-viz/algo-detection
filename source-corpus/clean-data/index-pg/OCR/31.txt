ASSOCIATION OR CORRELATION OF IDEAS. Did you ever pause
to wonder why all "VVesterza" stories are alike? Or why all underworld
stories are so similar in plot? Or why mystery stories all seemingly come
from the same mold? And why there is in general such a similarity in types
of stories that publishers are worrying themselves sick over the story problem?

I could go on describing examples of the "asscciation or correlation of
ideas" Which is responsible for the rut into Which thousands 0f writers fail,
and for the tens of thousands of hackneyed stories which they write, and then
wonder why they do not sell. Any editor could tail you that there is such a
rank similarity of ideas paraded across his desk daily that he is ready to throw
up his hands in despair before he has read the limit dozen manuscripts, and
then when something that is really novel and refreshing does come along, he
could almost threw his arms around the author.
