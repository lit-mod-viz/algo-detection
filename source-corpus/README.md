## Training Corpus

**1. Thirty Six Dramatic Situations** : Most accurate conversion by far, very
few errors.

**2. Plot Genie Index- General Formula** : Quite accurate, but a few letters
or words have not been recognised properly throughout the text. **Waiting for
transcription of the data**

**3. Plot Genie- Romance without Melodrama** : A lot of portions converted
well, but very large errors in letter identification, resulting in some
meaningless data. **The data has been cleaned - available in the *Clean Data*
Folder**

**4. Plot Genie- Detective-Mystery** : Few portions converted, but list
numbers are printed separately from list content, so might be difficult to map
number to text.

**5. Plot Genie- Action-Adventure -1931** : Very few portions are accurate,
and list to content mapping is not proper in this case as well. 

**6. Plotto** : Using the archive.org scan, clean but needs to a pass to
remove the numbers. In clean-data folder.

**7. Ten Million Photoplay Plots** : Pages are horizontally aligned and each
page of the PDF has two pages of the book, so it is not able to identify any
text and files have incorrectly identified content. Need to rotate and split
pages.
