ACTION—ADVENTURE

selacted from all the: matcxial we had compiled, 180 of the most spectac'
(1181' and climactic kinds 0f a‘ctign and placed this list whats it belcmgetd un~
der Operation 9, which pmvidcd the climax for the story.

Now, having left a hole in the middle of the formula, where colorful
action must of neczssity be present, WE were tempumrﬂy stumped again.
However, our volume: of thrilling and spectacular material, frcun which
We thained the 180 suggwtcd climaxes, afforded the, solution WE: pared
over these lists again, weighing each idea carefully, until we had obtained
900 colorful and exciting bits of action which were of a kind to result in
further complications rather than to yield action which was dimactic in
nature. These we selected for Operatirm 4‘ Inasmuch as. the disc on tha
Card Rabat contained but 180 numbers, it became necessary 1:0 divide
this list of caloz‘ful action simxatim into ﬁve groups, zus~wi11 be absenmd.

Still further experimentation with the ?.?ormula3 ezvém after these, major
changes wem completed, did not produce satisfactory results. Never din}
a chemist study a specimen under a, microﬁcope‘ and watnh its actian with
any more anxiety? than was eviﬂencred by us as W13 scrutinized aﬁd analyzed
our “sick“ formula, 1'11 an endeavor to discovar what was wrong; There
seamed to be something lacking, but we could mt immediately idemify
it" We found it, however. It war; locale that was lacking. This brings us
to the interesting observatiom that the simyle suggeetions Of a Charade;
a problem and a locale: are, all that are necessary to snap the creative imv

Of the plat csutiine throughout the entire Genie system. The solutimn tag
this pmblem was mggested by a method which was employed in the Sup»

Formula, two opma’cions were combined in one, or locale: was suggasted

however, frczm that which called for a similar method in this case, and was
described in that Index book. We decided ta combine locale. with the call

with the building of plotszrom outlines supplied by i:h€ Fonnuia, after this
improvement had been made, quickly ciemonstmted that we had located
the trouble and carrectad it.
