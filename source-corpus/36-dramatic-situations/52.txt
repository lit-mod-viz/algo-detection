TWELFTH SITUATION 47

One of the cases unused in the theater, notwith-
standing its frequency, is Temptation,‘already intro-
duced as a part of the preceding situation. The
irritated adversary is here the Deﬁant; the solicitor,
now the Tempter, has undertaken an unusual negotia-
tion, one for the obtaining of an object which nothing
can persuade the owner to part with; consequently the
aim must be, gently, little by little, to bewilder, charm
or stupefy him. Eternal role of woman toward man!
—and of how many things toward the project of
being a man! Does it not call to mind the hieratic
attitude of th: Christian toward Satan, as Flaubert
has illuminated it, with a thousand sparkling lights, in
his “Temptation of Saint Anthony '2”
