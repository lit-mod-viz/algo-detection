60 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATIONS

day more commonplace, and at the same time more ter-
rible, than the disclosure of an important secret or
the committing of a criminal act, while under the in-
ﬂuence of drink?

Is it necessary to say that all ties, all interests, all
human desires, may be represented crossed and illumin-
ated by the light of dementia? '

For the rest, this situation of Madness is far from'
having been neglected in our theater. Shakespeare,
in his most personal dramas, has made use ofinsanity
in the leading roles. Lady Macbeth is a somnambu-
list and dies in hysteria, her husband is a victim of
hallucinations; the same may be said of Hamlet, who is
a lypemaniac besides; of Timon also; Othello is an
epileptic and King Lear completely deranged. It is on
this account that the great William is so dangerous 3
model (Goethe would not read him more than once a
year). He has played, to some extent, the same role
as Michael-Angelo,~—he has exaggerated the springs of
action to the farthest limits of reality, beyond which
his disciples fall immediately into mere ridiculous
affectation. '

0n the other hand, if we except the pretext of study-
ing insanity in itself, which "Ajax" has furnished
from Astydamus to Ennius, and from Ennius to
Emperor Augustus, I ﬁnd nothing.“Shakespearian” in
the drama of antiquity except “Orestes.” All other
characters are in the enjoyment of their senses, and
do not thereby become any less pathetic. “(Edipus”
alone shows, in default of abnormality in the hero’s‘
psychologic'constitution, external events of an extra—
ordinary character (a resource since so largely used
by the Roman'ticists of 1830 and later). But the rest
of the antique dramatic types are evolved in accordance
with normal passions, and under objective conditions
relatively common.
