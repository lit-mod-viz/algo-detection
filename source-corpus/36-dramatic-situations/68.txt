SEVENTEENTH SITUATION 63

ity). An examination of the Twelfth Situation will
give us a primary idea of the way in which Ruse may
be used to gain this credulity. By Credulity also to
cause ones own misfortune, or lose possession of a loved
one, or cause misfortune to others, or cause the death
of a loved one.

Let us now pass to the causes which may precipitate
—as readily as curiosity, credulity, or pure imprud-
ence—an overhanging catastrophe. These causes are:
—the infraction of a prohibition or law previously made
by a divinity; the deadly effect of the act upon him who
commits it (an effect due to causes perhaps mechanical,
perhaps biological, perhaps judicial, perhaps martial,
etc.) ; the deadly consequences of the act for the
kindred or the beloved of him who commits it; a sin
previously committed, consciously or unconsciously,
and which is about to be revealed and punished.

Besides curiosity and credulity, other motives .may
determine the imprudence; in “The Trachiniae,” for
instance. it is jealousy. The same role might be given
to any one of the passions, the emotigns, the desires,
the needs, the tastes, the human weaknesses;———sleep,
hunger, muscular activity, gluttony, lust, coquetry.
childish simplicity. As to the ﬁnal disaster, it may
assume many aspects, since it may fall in turn upon
physical, moral or social well—being, whether by the
destruction of happiness or honor, of property or
power.

In the present situation, the Instigator,———who never-
theless is not essentia1,—may become worthy of ﬁgur-
ing even as the protagonist; such is the case of Medea
in “Pelias.” This is perhaps the most favorable aspect
in which the “villain” can be presented; imagine, for
instance, an Iago becoming the principal character of
a play (as Satan is of the world)! The difﬁculty will
be to ﬁnd a sufﬁcient motive for him; ambition, (partly
the case in Richard III) is not always a convincing one.
