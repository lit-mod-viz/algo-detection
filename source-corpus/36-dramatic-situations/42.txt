EIGHTH SITUATION
REVOLT

gElements: Tyrant and Conspiratori

As already observed, this situation is, in a measure‘
the converse of Class B of Situation VI.

Intngue, so dear to the public of the past three cen-
turles, is obviously supplied by the very nature of the
subject we are now to consider. But, by some strange
chance, it has, on the contrary, always been treated
with the 'most open candor and simplicity. One or two
viciSSItudes, a few surprises all too easily foreseen and
extending uniformly to all the personages of the play,
and there we have the conditions which have almost
invariably been attached to this action, so propitious,
nevertheless, to doubts, to equivocation, to a twilight
whose vague incertltude prepares the dawn of revolt
and of liberty.

A (1)——A Conspiracy Chieﬂy of One Individual:—
“The Conspiracy of Fiesco," by Schiller; Comeille's
“Cinna”; to some extent the “Catilina” of Voltaire
(this tragedy belongs rather to the Thirtieth Situa-
tion, “Ambition"); “Thermidor”; “The Conspiracy of
General Malet” (Augé de Lassus, 1889); “Le (gand
Soir” (Kampf) ; “Le Roi sans Royaume” (Decour elle,
1909) : “Lorenzaccio” (Musset).

(2)—A Conspiracy of Several:—“The Conspiracy of
the Pnzzi” by Alﬁeri; “Le Roman d’une Conspiration”
(by Fournier and Carré, after the story of Ranc);
