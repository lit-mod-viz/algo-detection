THIRTY—FIRST SITUATION '

CONFLICT WITH A GOD

(A Mortal; an Immortal)

‘Most anciently treated of all Situations is this strug-
gle. Into its Babel of dramatic construction all or
nearly all of the others may easily enter. For this is
the strife supreme; it is also the supreme folly
and the supreme imprudeuce. It offers the most
unprecedented aims of ambitions, audacious enter-
prises, titanesque conspiracies, Ixionian abductions;
the 'most fascinating of enigmas; the Ideal here
undergoes a rare assault of passions; prodigious
rivalries develop. As for the surrounding witnesses,
does not their sympathy often go to him whom
they should hate?—learning of his crime, is it
not sometimes their duty to punish him them-
selves, to sacriﬁce him to their faith, or to sacri-
-ﬁce themselves for him? Between the clearest of
kindred, hatreds will break forth. Then comes the
storm of disaster, the vanquished one bound to mis-
fortune, crushed before those whom he loves, unless,
—acme of horror—he has, in a transport of blind de-
lirium, dishonored or massacred them unknowingly.
Suppliants, seeking the lost lovea one, advance sad
theories and endeavor to disarm rancor,—but the
divine vengeance has been unchained!
