SIXTH SITUATION
DISASTER

(Elements: a Vanquished Power; a Victorious Enemy
or a Messenger).

Fear, catastrophe, the unforeseen; a great reversal of
roles; the powerful are overthrown, the weak exalted.
Here is the oft-recurring refrain of the Biblical books,
here the immortal echoes of the fall of Troy, at which
we still pale as though with a presentiment.

A (1)—Defeat Suffered:—“The Myrmidons” and
“The Persians" of Aeschylus; “The Shepherds" of
Sophocles. Example from ﬁction: “La Debﬁcle," by
Zola. History is made up of repetitions of this story.

(2) —A Fatherland Destroyed:——“The Xoanephores”
of Sophocles; Byron’s “Sardanapalus” (this corresponds
also to Class B, and toward the dénouement recalls the
Fifth Situation). Examples from history: Poland;
the great Invasions. From romance: “The War of the
Worlds” (Wells).

(3)—The Fall of Humanity. —the Mystery of
“Adam” (twelfth century).

(4)—A Natural Catastropez—“Terre d’ Epouvante"
(de Lorde and Morel, 1907). ’

B—A Monarch Overthrown (the converse of the
Eighth) :—Shakespeare’s “Henry VI" and “Richard
11.” Historic instances: Charles 1, Louis XVI, Nabo-
leon, etc.; and, substituting other authorities than
kings, Colomb, de Lesseps, and all disgraced ministers.
Examples from ﬁction: the end of “Tartarin,”
“L’Argent,” “Cesar Birotteau.”
