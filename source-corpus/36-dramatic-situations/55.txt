60 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATION S

by Shelley, (parricide as a means of escape from
mcest).

C—Hatred of Grandfather for Grandson:—
Metastasio’s “Cyrus”; the story of Amulius in the
beginning of Titus Livius (motive. tyrannical avarice).
Hatred oi uncle for nephew: "The Death of Came,” by
Crichna Cavi. One of the facets of “Harnlnt "

D—Hatred of Father-in-law for Sonrin-lawz—
Alﬁeri's “Agis and Saul" (motive. tyrannical avarice).
Historical example: Caesar and Pompey. Hatred of
two brothers-in—law. ex-rivals: “La Mer" (Jean
Jullien. 1891)—-the only modern drama. I may note In
passmg, in which one ﬁnds emotion increasing after
the death of the nrinclnal character. In this resnect
it conforms to reality, in whlch we may experience
shock or alarm, or cry out In dread, but in which we
do not ween. nor feel sorrow to the full. until after-
ward. all hope being forever ended.

E—Hatred of Mother in-law for Dauzhter-in-Iawze—
(Jumeille’s “Rodogune” (motive, tyrannical avarice).

F—Infanticide:—“Conte de Noel” (Linant, 1899). ,A
part of the “Powers of Darkness.”

I will not repeat the list of degrees of relationship
into which this situation might be successively trans-
ferred. The case of hatred between sisters, one
frequent enough, will otfer,—even after “Le Carnaval
des Enfants" (de Bouhélier)——an excellent opportunity
for a study of feminine enmities, so lasting and so
cruel; hatred of mother and daughter, of brother and
sister, will be not less interesting; the same may be
said for the converse of each class which has furnished
our examples. May there not be an especially ﬁne
dramatic study in the deep subject,—heretofore so
vulgar because treated by vulgar hands,—the antip-
athy of the mother and the husband of a young
woman? Does it not represent the natural conﬂict
between the ideal, childhood, purity, on the one hand.
