10 THIRTY-SIX DRAMATIC SITUATION S

cepting this rule, “taken great pains” to verify it (and
the pains of a Schiller!) thereby giving it the addition-
al authority of his powerful criticism and his rich
memory? And Goethe, his opposite in all things save
a strong taste for the abstract,—Goethe, who through-
out his life seems to have considered the subject, adds
his testimony years after the death of Schiller, years
after their fruitful conversations, at the very time
when he was completing “Faust,” that supreme combi-
nation of contrasting elements.

In ﬁance, Gérard de Nerval alone had grasped and
presented brieﬂy the ensemble of all dramatic produc-
tion, in an article upon Soumet’s “Jane Grey,” in
“L’Artiste,”—written, unfortunately, with what dandy-
ism of style! Having early desired to know the exact
number of actions possible to the theater, he found, he
tells us, twenty-four. His basis, however, is far from
satisfactory. Falling back upon the outworn classiﬁ-
cation of the seven capital sins, he ﬁnds himself obliged
at the outset to eliminate two of them, gluttony and
sloth, and very nearly a third, lust (this would be
Don Juan, perhaps). It is not apparent what man-
ner of tragic energy has ever been furnished by ava-
rice, and the divergence between pride (presumably the
spirit of tyranny) and anger, does not promise well
for the contexture of drama, the manifestations of
the latter being too easily confounded with those of
envy. Furthermore, murder or homicide, which he
indicates as a factor for obtaining several new situa-
tions, by uniting it in turn with each of the others,
cannot be accepted as such, since it is but an accident
common to all of them, possible in all, and one most
frequently produced by all. And ﬁnally, the sole title
mentioned by Nervsl, “Rivalry of Queen and Subject,”
corresponds, it will be observed, only to a sub-class of
one, pot of his twenty-four, but of Gozzi’slThirty-six
Situations.
