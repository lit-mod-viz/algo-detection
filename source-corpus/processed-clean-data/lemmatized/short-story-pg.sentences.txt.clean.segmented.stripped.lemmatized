in what way -PRON- be plan to frighten -PRON- or -PRON- 
who be the character who be infatuate 
with whom be -PRON- infatuate 
how could such an infatuation prove to be an obstacle 
why be an appeal make to the underworld

to what character in the underworld be the appeal make 
what complication result 
who be back of the crooked politic 
how do this deprive one of justice 
who be deprive of justice 
what be the motive of the crooked politician 
what person object or situation be mistake as to identity in the climax 
who make the mistake 
how be the mistake make 
what be the person object or situation erroneously think to be 
what bearing do this have on a crisis in which the principal character find -PRON- 
who be the person with the guilty conscience 
of what do -PRON- know -PRON- to be guilty 
what do -PRON- fear from exposure 
in this robot outline no stretch of the imagination be necessary to associate together logically the locale and the principal character by the animal trainer make an appearance behind the footlight in either a circus or theater 
let -PRON- make this a circus story 
the fact that some one be deprive of justice as state in the crisis suggest that one of the important character perhaps the animal trainer be a fugitive from justice or have be accuse of something of which -PRON- or -PRON- be innocent and that some other character be use a knowledge of this for blackmail purpose 
under the head of method an appeal be make to the underworld and some one who be also motivate with a desire to frighten an enemy 
of the many interpretation possible in this situation one may be that the animal trainer be a woman who in some manner have be previously connect with the underworld and who have escape -PRON- toil and who be now be pursue by a man 
in fact -PRON- may as well impregnate the entire story with an underworld flavor and give -PRON- the follow development 
a beautiful young woman who have be the sweetheart of a gangster have decide to desert the underworld and return to -PRON- profession which be that of an animal trainer 
-PRON- obtain a position with the circus and be pursue by the gangster who be madly infatuate with -PRON- 
-PRON- refuse to have anything further to do with -PRON- 
in the meantime in order to frighten -PRON- into leave -PRON- alone -PRON- threaten to have -PRON- arrest for a murder which have be commit by the gang 
this greatly enrage -PRON- and -PRON- return to -PRON- gang and -PRON- discuss take -PRON- for a ride because -PRON- know too much 
finally -PRON- be decide that a well plan be to hang the crime on -PRON- which -PRON- proceed to do 
in the meantime -PRON- line up with a crooked prosecutor or other official who be in league with -PRON- and the girl be arrest in the midst of a performance and charge with murder 
now -PRON- come to the climax or surprise twist 
during the process of the trial and when the gangster be on the witness stand -PRON- see the man whom -PRON- think -PRON- -PRON- have kill and for whose murder -PRON- be try to have the girl convict 
think -PRON- to be a case of the dead come to life -PRON- lose -PRON- nerve and become so excited that -PRON- confess the murder -PRON- 
the man in the audience be the long lose twin of the man who be murder and -PRON- have unexpectedly appear on the scene 
the end 
here -PRON- have a surprise twist and a trick end 
by reserve the fact that the murder man have a twin -PRON- provide -PRON- with a trick end and by have a character do something unexpected at or near the end of the story -PRON- have the desire surprise twist 
another way to have accomplish the same purpose would have be to have a male member of the circus one who love the girl and who be a clever makeup artist disguise -PRON- so as to look exactly like the murdered man and then appear in courtroom at the psychological moment 
the only trouble about this latter suggestion would be that -PRON- would probably introduce too much material for a shortshort story because -PRON- would be necessary to devote some attention to the romance between the couple 
i can see that by use this treatment the story could be develop into a ten thousand word story or more 
-PRON- reader will of course understand that this be only one of score of shortshort story plot that could be evolve from outline number of the even number and -PRON- be develop in less than fifteen minute 
now let -PRON- select one of the number outline and develop a plot in which there be no melodrama 
let -PRON- also take number from this list 
the question which -PRON- would ask -PRON- may be as follow where be the cabaret locate 
what be the husband do in the cabaret 
whose husband be -PRON- 
what be -PRON- profession 
who be the loved one whose soul be to be save 
in what way be the soul about to be save 
how be -PRON- propose to save the soul 
be the lost soul a man or a woman 
be the lost soul any relation to the husband 
what relation 
who be possess of false pride 
who make the pathetic effort to eclipse another 
in what way be the effort make 
who be the other one 
why be the effort pathetic 
what kind of a mistake be about to be make on account of a dream 
who be about to make the mistake 
who be the dreamer 
what be the dream 
how could a dream cause the mistake 
how do a little child bring about a reconciliation 
between whom be a reconciliation affect 
what have be the cause of the rift between the party who become reconcile 
what relation be the child to the party who become reconcile 
be the husband one of the party who become reconcile 
if so with whom do -PRON- become reconcile 
be the child any relation to the husband 
if so what 
a young woman who have be a dancer become the wife of a more or less prosaic or commonplace husband whose position some time later place -PRON- in contact with a radio station 
-PRON- be discover that -PRON- have natural ability as a singer 
-PRON- be give few tryout take training and soon become a star baritone 
the couple have a little girl three or four year old and be the wife of a star whose time and attention be largely monopolize by other people soon become burdensome to the wife 
have be a dancer -PRON- have some professional ambition which never forsake -PRON- and -PRON- take seriously the remark make by some of -PRON- friend about the attention pay to -PRON- husband by other woman 
professional engagement take the husband away for a time and the wife place the little girl in the care of a friend and resolve to make a name for -PRON- in the professional world 
the first opportunity that present -PRON- be in a night club 
the husband return and be shock 
-PRON- go to the night club and please with -PRON- to give up the idea and -PRON- proudly refuse 
-PRON- see that -PRON- be in an atmosphere that may prove to be ruinous 
-PRON- can think of nothing but -PRON- consume ambition to become -PRON- equal professionally or to perhaps eclipse -PRON- 
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be go to the devil 
this result in an estrangement 
for a time -PRON- make veil appeal to -PRON- over the radio as -PRON- sing to -PRON- audience 
-PRON- get the message but do not heed -PRON- 
then come a time when -PRON- in the broadcasting studio hear the announcer describe an accident to an unidentified child who have be run down by an automobile and -PRON- recognize -PRON- as -PRON- own 
in the midst of a gay number at the cabaret -PRON- hear the same announcement and with a cry dash from the stage 
the two meet at the bedside of the injure tot at the hospital and silently pray for -PRON- life 
the child hover between life and death for day during which time all misunderstanding between the mother and the father be melt away and when the child recover consciousness -PRON- see -PRON- in each other arm 
when the father ask the little one how -PRON- come to run away and be injure -PRON- reply dream the devil be after -PRON- mama and i be go down to get -PRON- 
the end 
-PRON- be more difficult to write a heart interest drama than -PRON- be a melodrama and even though this little story appear to have less plot in -PRON- than the other one more mental effort have be require to write -PRON- as to include the necessary heart interest and pathos as well as the dramatic punch at the end 
attention be direct here to the difference between the trick end or surprise twist which be find in the other story and the dramatic punch or heart throb which -PRON- have at the end of this one 
here -PRON- have not purposely reserve any pertinent fact introduce misleading dialogue or have any character do some unexpected thing at the last minute in order to provide the trick end or surprise twist 
instead -PRON- have simply use the child statement of -PRON- dream about -PRON- mother as the climax 
there be heart interest in this for the reason that -PRON- emphasize the love of the child for -PRON- mother and establish the fact that -PRON- have perhaps overhead the father statement that the mother be go to the devil and have take -PRON- seriously 
to have introduce the statement of the child earlier in the story would have be to have lose the dramatic punch and heart interest climax at the end 
all of which go to show that the way in which one tell the story be as important as the story -PRON- 
right here -PRON- may be well to emphasize the fact that the plot genie be not design to supply the continuity for a story but merely a plot outline 
in other word -PRON- be not necessary that the introduction of story element appear in the same order or even a similar order in the finished story as -PRON- do in the plot outline 
the genie be intend to supply the plot and then the author can tell the story in any manner desire 
one must first have a story before -PRON- can tell -PRON- however and to supply this story be the purpose of the plot genie

importance of literary style be -PRON- not for the clever literary style employ in the writing of a great many shortshort story which have be accept and publish -PRON- would have qualify as ordinary shortstorie only 
what be mean by this be that great many clever writer have take what would otherwise have be an ordinary shortstory and by either purposely mislead the reader with dialogue which have a double meaning or by withhold important fact until the last paragraph -PRON- have make -PRON- into a shortshort story 
in other word -PRON- have give -PRON- what -PRON- call the trick end which be a big dramatic punch or surprise to the reader

-PRON- be in which the dialogue be so clever that -PRON- elicit a chuckle or an outright laugh

well any other time -PRON- know 
in which the dialogue be so cleverly write that -PRON- portray a character so clearly that one can almost feel -PRON- have know the person

and spud with the admiration which the more homely and cautious of two intimate always show for the other have study jack until -PRON- know -PRON- better than -PRON- do -PRON- 
that be why spud know what attitude toward elsie saunder must be even though jack have become taciturn and avoid look spud in the eye 
elsie saunder be a hostess at the royal palm dance palace on st bedolf street in boston 
spud have take one look at -PRON- and buy all -PRON- dance ticket for the rest of the evening 
slim and undeniably graceful with wideset blue eye and flaxen curly hair -PRON- seem an angel to spud 
and in the next few evening spud do -PRON- good to prove that -PRON- be well make of well stuff than -PRON- unprepossessing exterior indicate -PRON- be 
at any rate spud look forward to see -PRON- after -PRON- next voyage 
of course -PRON- didnot mention this unusual fidelity to -PRON- watch mate 
-PRON- know jack too well 
love -PRON- and leave -PRON- 
jack would say scornfully if not too originally 
that be jack a reckless and handsome devil who could get away with -PRON- 
and because spud have never find a girl worth hang on to -PRON- have agree with jack 
-PRON- be different though when spud meet elsie 
unfortunately on -PRON- next arrival in port -PRON- fall to spud to stand the anchor watch while the rest of the crew go ashore in the longboat 
and when spud finally get to the royal palm dance palace late that night -PRON- find jack dance with elsie saunder 
spud do not blame elsie for the obvious fact that -PRON- have fall for jack 
who would give a gorilla like -PRON- a second look when jack be about 
nor do -PRON- blame jack for cut in on -PRON- 
jack have always grab the good girl -PRON- see even if spud have date -PRON- first 
-PRON- have not matter much before 
and what be to become of the girl jack have love and leave hadnot matter either 
but elsie the two watch mate have go to sea again and spud have try for three day to convince -PRON- that love -PRON- and leave -PRON- go for elsie as well as any other girl 
-PRON- may have succeed in convince -PRON- if jack too have seem to realize that elsie be different if jack hadnot avoid look -PRON- former chum in the eye 
but spud have fail and jack would pay now 
in spite of -PRON- strain hand spud feel the rope sag beneath weight 
-PRON- see the catlike nervousness with which jack balance -PRON- 
jack be scare 
and spud grin mirthlessly as eye look into -PRON- own for the first time in three day 
-PRON- ainot lose -PRON- nerve jack 
spud ask -PRON- voice harshly derisive above the sound of the wind in the rig 
jack nod in the affirmative and grin wryly 
with good reason too -PRON- say something be afraid to tell yuh 
spud feel the rope bite into -PRON- calloused hand 
-PRON- could hold but a moment longer 
what be -PRON- -PRON- ask indifferently 
that after all the braggin i do about love -PRON- and leavin -PRON- jack blurt out go and do -PRON- 
i get hitch 
spud feel numb 
so that be why jack have be afraid to look -PRON- in the eye 
come in quick -PRON- grate 
jack startle at the harsh command obey -PRON- instantly automatically 
and as -PRON- spring to the lee rig release the strain on the foot rope the foot rope snap taut 
the sudden jerk throw spud from the yard 
be good to -PRON- 
spud yelled as -PRON- hurtle toward the deck below 
the end 
tis be one of the good example i have ever see where by exercise clever judgment in the point of attack or in the manner of open the story the author have immediately arouse the interest of the reader in what would probably have be an uninteresting story if treat differently 
-PRON- will note that mr fellow with -PRON- opening paragraph have jump right into the action which immediately precede the climax 
the average inexperienced author and a great many who be not inexperienced would have begin the story with the later paragraph which be indicate by indentation and would have probably lose a sale 
in this story the author first establish a highly dramatic situation by tell -PRON- in the first five line that one of -PRON- character be out to kill the other one thereby also establish a strong thread of suspense and create in -PRON- mind a desire to know the why s and wherefore or what -PRON- be all about 
then eight paragraph later -PRON- describe in less than one hundred word the event lead up to the crisis with which -PRON- open the story and present the entire background and complication at the same time give -PRON- a history of -PRON- character 
the plot in this story be very ordinary be nothing more than a situation in which a jealous rival sacrifice -PRON- for the benefit of another man who have a well right to the girl 
the climax be not particularly strong nor novel 
-PRON- be no doubt the author manner of tell the story in such a way as to immediately seize the interest of the reader and hold -PRON- that result in the sale of this story to the next publish shortshort from which be outstanding and call for favorable comment be publish on may -PRON- follow by guy gilpatric -PRON- pull into lyon at about midnight and find that -PRON- have twenty minute to wait 
beth say -PRON- feel hungry so i walk along the platform to one of those little white enamel pushcart buffet that -PRON- have in the french railroad station and buy a jar of meat pate some fresh flaky roll and a demi of burgundy 
i be just pay for these when i see a switch locomotive shunt a flat car into the shed and couple -PRON- to the rear of -PRON- train 
on this flat car lash by the wheel be a shiny black wagon such as be use by undertaker when -PRON- call around at the house to pick up a job 
sit under this wagon be two gendarme huddle in -PRON- cloak and smoking cigarette 
i call the buffet boy attention 
oh 
why that be monsieur black wagon -PRON- exclaim 
do -PRON- know what be inside that wagon monsieur 
-PRON- be the bois de justice the guillotine 
there be an execution here this morning and now -PRON- be take -PRON- back to paris 
but buy a paper monsieur and -PRON- will read 
i buy and have take the paper and the food back to the compartment i start to read aloud 
ugh 
beth interrupt before i be half through 
if -PRON- must read such horror read -PRON- to -PRON- 
i be try to eat 
please 
-PRON- wasnot the sort of thing to give one an appetite at that 
a certain madame lubet who have pay the plenty of -PRON- crime at fourteen minute after five that morning 
monsieur deibler who -PRON- appear always attend to these little matter for the republic have arrive from paris with the official guillotine the night before and have set -PRON- up on the cobblestone in the prison yard 
now in do this say the journal monsieur deibler have be gravely at fault 
for when the struggle victim be lash to the table the apparatus have shift just enough on the uneven cobble to cause the knife to jam at well at an awkward point 
thus the job be not exactly neat in fact -PRON- completion have require a certain amount of hand work by monsieur deibler 
-PRON- be deplorable the newspaper declare that the horror of capital punishment should thus be increase by the blunder of the callous ghoul who be pay to inflict -PRON- 
-PRON- respectfully petition the minister of justice to dismiss the man deibler from the service of the state 
the train be click across the switch out of the yard 
a shadow fall across -PRON- 
-PRON- turn and see a cadaverous figure stand in the door a man who wear a long black cloak and who carry beneath -PRON- arm a black tin case about the size and shape of a hatbox 
-PRON- bow low 
pardon -PRON- say and -PRON- voice be a hoarse croak 
if i may intrude i will avail -PRON- of this vacant place 
there be nothing for -PRON- to say so i merely nod and wave -PRON- hand toward the seat beside -PRON- 
the dismal specter bow again settle -PRON- wearily upon the cushion and place the tin box between -PRON- 
i glance at beth 
-PRON- be lean forward from -PRON- place in the corner stare at the thin ivoryyellow countenance of the newcomer 
i catch -PRON- eye 
-PRON- incline -PRON- head slightly and move -PRON- lip 
no sound come from -PRON- but i know -PRON- be say deibler 
i have no doubt of course that -PRON- be right 
here sit beside -PRON- in the compartment be the headsman of france -PRON- who have this very morning complete with -PRON- own man the gruesome job which -PRON- apparatus have bungle 
an unpleasant odor become vaguely perceptible an odor as of cheap perfume mix with a chemical disinfectant 
i have never smell any embalm fluid and yet i recognize -PRON- at once 
i wonder and yet be afraid to wonder what be in that tin box 
monsieur deibler sigh sepulchrally and commence jot something in a notebook which -PRON- rest upon -PRON- bony knee 
-PRON- seem to be draw curve and line 
i glance surreptitiously over -PRON- shoulder 
what -PRON- have draw be profile view of a womans head with dotted line cross the neck and skull 
-PRON- study this diagram in solemn silence and at length 
then sigh once more -PRON- thrust the notebook into -PRON- pocket and turn to -PRON- 
monsieur -PRON- say pardon the liberty which i take in address -PRON- 
but today monsieur i have have great misfortune 
-PRON- career will be ruin 
i ask -PRON- monsieur do -PRON- see this evening paper 
the er legal news 
yes i answer do see -PRON- monsieur 
ah -PRON- say 
then -PRON- have guess to what i refer 
-PRON- be not a matter which ordinarily i would mention before stranger and -PRON- bow to beth and smile a wolfish smile before a charming lady 
i donot know exactly what i say but in any case fault if there be a fault be with the apparatus -PRON- continue 
the affair be entirely beyond human control 
harsh thing have be say about -PRON- by those in important circle 
the name even of the minister of justice have be invoke 
well too can appeal to monsieur the minister 
with what i have here 
-PRON- pat the tin case and chuckle sardonically 
i shudder and edge away from -PRON- along the seat 
in the box monsieur 
i exclaim recoil 
-PRON- have -PRON- in the box 
ah pray put -PRON- out in the corridor 
oh no indeed -PRON- demur 
-PRON- be so precious that i do not want -PRON- out of -PRON- sight 
people be say that i be force to cut away er cut away what be leave by hand 
but with the content of this box monsieur i hope to be able to convince both the medical authority and the official of justice that all such talk be rank calumny 
but see monsieur 
-PRON- unsnap a catch and throw open the top of the box 
there with lip purple cheek waxen eye glassy and -PRON- hair a tangle mass of black repose a head 
i hear beth give that little whispery cry that always mean -PRON- be about to faint 
thing go against -PRON- today but now i will appeal to the high tribunal croak the headsman will set up -PRON- apparatus in court and demonstrate that -PRON- could not possibly be as the witness and the newspaper have say 
yes pierre auguste renoir giraudy the great hairdresser in france will prove with this model that suzette valier who claim seventy thousand franc damage because -PRON- permanent wave machine burn off -PRON- hair be a liar 
one of the first thing that impress the reader of this story be that the author have travel and know -PRON- locale 
-PRON- description of french atmosphere be so perfect that the reader be immediately transport into the realm of the story 
follow this -PRON- be immediately interested when -PRON- start to describe gruesome detail of an execution by guillotine which have take place that morning thereby plant the event or set the stage for what -PRON- be to follow 
the outstanding feature of this story be the clever manipulation of dialogue and description in such a way as to totally mislead the reader or rather to cause the reader to mislead -PRON- by form the wrong conclusion which by the way be very natural in this case 
in this story not only be the reader fool but so be the two main character all be lead to believe that the eccentric hair dresser be none other than the equally unusual executioner and that the tin box contain the gruesome sever head of the execute woman 
in look back over this story after experience the surprise shock and consequent relief in the last paragraph one can not find a single instance of where the author have practice any fraud on the reader 
every bit of dialogue action and description be logical and can be account for 
of course the whole story be base on coincidence of the strange kind but not upon something that could not happen 
as a shortshort story with a surprise twist end this be a masterpiece 
the next one which i will analyze be write by a woman and be highlight with clever and sophisticated description and dialogue throughout besides have a stinger in the last line 
this story be publish in on april and follow by roberta yate glad to see -PRON- ellen 
of course i be

even if -PRON- be idiot enough to be -PRON- mistress first -PRON- add 
observe how this author establish the contrast character of these sister in two paragraph of less than fifty word 
both be intensely human and just exactly like girl -PRON- all know although -PRON- be so different from each other 
study the second paragraph which be indent and just observe the dramatic complication that be suggest by thus author in a bit of dialogue between the two girl 
-PRON- do not have to be tell that the old one be involve 
then look at the way -PRON- build up -PRON- character in those five word ellen give -PRON- an athletic hug 
miss yate set -PRON- stage and move -PRON- character about with a vim and snap that be refresh 
-PRON- do -PRON- with a few word in the paragraph a sentence which be intend and set in black 
the author then stand -PRON- on -PRON- head figuratively speak with a last line that take -PRON- breath wow what a stinger and something to think about 
this be one of those six method of supply the surprise or trick end wherein fact which be pertinent to the story be purposely withhold to supply the necessary punch in the last paragraph 
number four which follow and which be one of the first shortshort to be publish in be outstanding because of two feature

just visualize the scene descry in paragraph one almost shiver and experience the chill mist and thin soupy rain 
observe how the author intersperse -PRON- history or retrospect with interesting action and dialogue which keep the story move as illustrate in about the 12th paragraph which be indent 
also observe how cleverly -PRON- have handle the continuity of -PRON- story or the change of time and place with no apparent break or annoying lapse 
the big feature in this story be the climax or paradoxical ending which leave the reader aghast and force -PRON- to go back and read the story over again in an effort to discover what could possibly have lead up to -PRON- shocking end 
in other word -PRON- certainly leave much food for thought and speculation and be one of those story which stick in one mind because -PRON- leave unanswere a number of question 
why do the girl commit suicide 
how do -PRON- discover the bill be counterfeit 
be this the straw that break the camel back 
this be the type of shortshort that henry may have write and -PRON- be easy to see why the editor who buy -PRON- immediately recognize -PRON- merit
