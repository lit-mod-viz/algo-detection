Hill referred to his aardboard spinner wheel as; a “Plat Robot.”
An aspiring author was instructed to turn the device a certain
number of times, to select a randam number (usually between 1
to 180). Plot Genie users; then exonssulted the lists to arrive at all
the elements Hill believed necesssary for a fully realized plot.

websites make an excellent subsstitute for the Plot Robot“
