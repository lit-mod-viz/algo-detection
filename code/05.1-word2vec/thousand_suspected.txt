-PRON- three pulqueswillin breed who run mangy sheep an cattle while -PRON- loafs in sierrita or ride gun trail -PRON- wouldnotve 
be side grate woulda want the fun of do sech a stinkin job hissef 
joe burnie look at the stack of cure dobe brick ready to form the house -PRON- and judy ward would occupy when -PRON- be build and -PRON- be marry 
scowl uneasily -PRON- look back at tim and state -PRON- canot go gunnin for grute tim a killer an when crowded i cn be one too

no use worry judy unnecessarily -PRON- fig ure 
poor kid shed have too many wor rie anyhow since -PRON- fatherd die and shed have to sell -PRON- little ranch to level the debt -PRON- would leave

judy ward wasnot the only one who be afraid of ben grute who leave -PRON- coyote spread for -PRON- breed hand to run while -PRON- stay in sierrita gambling drink ing and roughhandle the darkskinned senorita 
a majority of the populace fear grute who d kill two man here on -PRON- own stomping ground and whose gun be for hire away from there 
stranger would hit town and talk to -PRON- or -PRON- would receive a letter and then grute would ride out 
when -PRON- return -PRON- would be wellheele with cash and would make brag reference to a gunslinging job -PRON- would do in texas new mexico or ari zona 
so folk in sierrita have reason to fear ben grute

at -PRON- favorite table by the wall grute sit read an old newspaper 
look up -PRON- eye narrow when -PRON- see the sixshooter drag at right hip and then a hun gry wolfish grin spread over -PRON- face

so -PRON- would bet ter fork over the dinero an ride close herd on -PRON- mouth 
savvy as -PRON- speak grute raise -PRON- left hand and begin shake -PRON- finger under nose 
that be the move joe have hope for 
brace -PRON- -PRON- lean a little toward grute and bark -PRON- both get gun so stop the gab an grab 
grute as -PRON- go for -PRON- gun stiffen -PRON- left arm and ram the palm of -PRON- upraised left hand against chest 
for an instant then -PRON- feature twist the fluid rhythm of -PRON- draw be break and -PRON- jerk as though -PRON- would contact a wire charge with elec tricity 
in that split second joe get the break -PRON- would play forbut -PRON- be barely an even break and nothing more 
the gun of both man clear leather and flash flame and lead simultaneously 
the only difference between -PRON- be that grute surprised and upset by the sudden realization that -PRON- trick to cinch a surefire kill have boomerang throw -PRON- lead away 
-PRON- slug tug at shirt leave a welt along left side bullet place with cold delibera tion smash chest 
a horrible shocked expression on -PRON- face stagger by the force of lead grute drop -PRON- sixgun and grip the rim of the bar

a moment later there come a wild call in shrill feminine tone help 
oh be there no one to protect -PRON-

the gallant young planter be not the one to hang back in the face of such an appeal 
since -PRON- sword be ever -PRON- favorite weapon -PRON- draw -PRON- shout for caesar to follow and race toward the light ahead 
as -PRON- draw nearer the flickering gleam resolve -PRON- into a lanthom carry beside a driver on a ponderous coach

another man have dismount at the coach door which be fling open 
in a twinkling capt paul draw a pistol with -PRON- left hand and fire at the fellow at the horse headsfire as -PRON- gallop and with the dark night make -PRON- none too sure in -PRON- aim 
capt paul could use either hand with equal facility and but for the darkness and the wild pace at which -PRON- ride -PRON- well know that the bullet would have find -PRON- mark 
as -PRON- be the man at the horse head fire a weapon of -PRON- own so that a bullet sing uncomfortably close to capt ear

the villainous play have be bravely carry out and at no little risk to the player 
the patriot leader who have request jone to take the box to -PRON- plantation and hold -PRON- until call for have throw as much secrecy as possible about theirjdan and operation 
that the secret of the paper be out be due rather to tory guile and vigilance rather than to any lack of cautiousness on the part of the patriot 
while not expect to encounter difficulty capt paul be on the alert for -PRON- but -PRON- would have look upon -PRON- as a heartless wretch have -PRON- pass a woman who need aid and fail to give -PRON-
