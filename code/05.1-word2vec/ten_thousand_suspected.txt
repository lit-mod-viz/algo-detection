judy ward wasnot the only one who be afraid of ben grute who leave -PRON- coyote spread for -PRON- breed hand to run while -PRON- stay in sierrita gambling drink ing and roughhandle the darkskinned senorita 
a majority of the populace fear grute who d kill two man here on -PRON- own stomping ground and whose gun be for hire away from there 
stranger would hit town and talk to -PRON- or -PRON- would receive a letter and then grute would ride out 
when -PRON- return -PRON- would be wellheele with cash and would make brag reference to a gunslinging job -PRON- would do in texas new mexico or ari zona

that the secret of the paper be out be due rather to tory guile and vigilance rather than to any lack of cautiousness on the part of the patriot 
while not expect to encounter difficulty capt paul be on the alert for -PRON- but -PRON- would have look upon -PRON- as a heartless wretch have -PRON- pass a woman who need aid and fail to give -PRON-

as -PRON- happen rotherick knelt face -PRON- bend over and use the hatchet on a cask below 
have the man back be to the young planter a welldirecte blow would have stun the fellow and make -PRON- capture comparatively an easy matter 
but that consider the circumstance be out of the question 
the head of the cask be quickly smash reveal the black content 
as rotherick reach for the powder horn one of the prisoner roll from beneath the bunk and struggle to -PRON- knee before capt paul have a chance to get at -PRON- 
the fellow have chew at the cord until -PRON- have part and -PRON- be free to use -PRON- tongue 
look out rotherick -PRON- roar 
capt jone yere talkin to 
rotherick leap erect glare 
so ho -PRON- shout the traitor -PRON- the -PRON- be reach for -PRON- dirk when the young planter grapple with -PRON- 
there be a terrific struggle back and forth across the cabin each man seek to draw a weapon and bring the battle to an end the other prevent -PRON- 
at last with an effort that call forth all -PRON- great strength capt paul tear away and strike rotherick from -PRON- 
the sailor stagger backward strike the lanthom with -PRON- foot and topple -PRON- through the trap 
from that moment -PRON- be a drawn battle 
neither combatant thought of anything but get clear of the roost in the short possible time 
as -PRON- bound past the man kneel on the floor the young planter linger an instant to sever the cord that bind -PRON- foot then race on 
-PRON- gain the after deck catch a glimpse of rotherick and the robber behind -PRON- and bluish flash puff upward from the hold and a thunderous explosion follow 
the young planter daze and bewilder find -PRON- a few minute after the explosion stand on the creek bank lean against a tree 
-PRON- left arm numb and bleeding hang limply at -PRON- side 
a dozen yard away the wreck of the roost be burn fiercely float fragment of the illstarre craft litter the water for a hundred foot up and down the small stream 
rotherick be nowhere in sight nor be the robber 
capt paul be presently aware that some one be talk to -PRON- and that the muzzle of a gun be stare -PRON- in the face ye try ter fight cause i get the dead wood on ye 
now tell -PRON- what s become o capt paul jone 
be -PRON- in that alec be behind the rifle and in -PRON- face be a strange mingling of grief and determination 
the young planter in -PRON- borrow garb be not recognize by the boy albeit the planter hat be go and but for the excitement of the moment wit would have prove equal to the emergency 
capt paul alec answer jone weakly 
the man rotherick come aboard the flatboat and -PRON- have a struggle 
a lighted lanthom be knock into the hold on a lot of powder and the magazine blow up 
capt paul cry alec 
yer own mother wouldnot have know ye in that getup hurt 
look at yer all bloody 
yes say the young planter have a close call of -PRON- and not -PRON- yet by a long chalk 
get the horse alec dizzy and can hardly stand 
as -PRON- speak capt paul sink down at the base of the tree everything in -PRON- range of vision whirl about -PRON- 
for some time after that -PRON- have only a confused notion of what happen 
-PRON- be not unconscious as -PRON- have be in -PRON- own house the evening before but -PRON- be on the verge of -PRON- 
the rough treatment rotherick have give -PRON- at the plantation may have have something to do with -PRON- hazy condition in the main however the explosion be to be jeld responsible 
how -PRON- have gain the shore when the deck of the flatboat heave upward beneath -PRON- capt paul have not 
-PRON- slight idea 
-PRON- remember vaguely that alec come with the brse and lift -PRON- to -PRON- saddle then that -PRON- ihreade the wood 
next dame gilpin and -PRON- husband be help -PRON- 
rom the horse and after that -PRON- be in a chair dame gilpin attend to -PRON- arm and master gilpin hold a jewter mug of madeira to -PRON- lip 
presently -PRON- walk to a couch assist by the ferryman and sink into a heavy slumber 
-PRON- sleep out the remainder of that day and the whole ff the succeed night apparently in as deep a trance as be duncan macbean but -PRON- be a natural sleep the deep of a man who have endure much and be far spend with weariness 
-PRON- dream have to do with the ebony box intrust to -PRON- by the virginia patriot 
when -PRON- awake the morning sun be look in at the open door and terence omalley and master gilpin be stand at the head of the couch 
ah ha cry omalley the lad -PRON- again 
faith -PRON- a wonder -PRON- s alive at all at all 
yez may well say that same masther omalley -PRON- an echoing brogue from the kitchen 
-PRON- be dame gilpin who like the dash terence be a gift of the ould sod to the new world 
many a man would have be dead long since av -PRON- have go through all that 
capt paul have do 
sure -PRON- a lad av iron -PRON- be 
how do ye feel captain ask gilpin as the young planter sit up on the couch 
hearty thank -PRON- smile the young planter must have sleep well i take -PRON- 
the whole night long sir say gilpin 
capt paul whistle incredulously 
where do -PRON- come from omalley -PRON- inquire afield with some of the other planter tryin to jet a crack at old truepenny tyburn north of the river and i ride over here for a word with master gilpin 
-PRON- think -PRON- couldnot trust -PRON- to scatter this iband of robber 
not so -PRON- lad cry omalley trust ye scatter anything from a corporal guard o red coat to a company o the own do -PRON- work paul the mangy breed be scatter by that night work at -PRON- plantation an the blowin up of the roost 
the leader be tryin to get clear an be hot after -PRON- 
-PRON- hear about the explosion then 
everyone have hear of -PRON- up an down the river 
as near as -PRON- can make out three o the band lose -PRON- life in the fight at -PRON- plantation an two more be find near the char wreck o the flatboat 
that make foive an old truepenny be not strong enough in number to stand the loss of so many 
the plantation paul owin to -PRON- gallant work be well rid o the band those that be leave be makin for distant part to leave ye now happy in the thought that yere -PRON- again 
hold hard a minute terence cry paul 
when do -PRON- halt at -PRON- place last 
in the early hour of the mornin 
have anyone call there inquire for -PRON- 
not a soul -PRON- boy 
capt paul be think of the man who be to call with the letter from mr adam and the key to the ebony box 
the messenger have not yet arrive and there be still time for -PRON- to make another attempt at recover the paper 
how be duncan macbean 
terence omalley shake -PRON- head a strange case for ye 
bob tichenor be there and -PRON- say condition be the quar thing -PRON- would ever encounter 
-PRON- lie quiet enough breathin natural and seeminly asleep 
sure -PRON- must have be a powerful drug 
but tichenor think hell come around all right an ye give -PRON- time 
omalley thereupon take -PRON- departure and capt paul get up and strip -PRON- of the borrow gear which -PRON- have don on the flatboat 
although -PRON- arm pain -PRON- the numbness be go and on the whole -PRON- feel well 
a brief examination show -PRON- that -PRON- be not to be cripple nor to be long without the use of the hand 
furthermore -PRON- discover that -PRON- have lose neither -PRON- sword nor -PRON- pistol 
if -PRON- have not carry -PRON- ashore after the explosion alec must have find -PRON- and take -PRON- in charge 
anyhow the weapon lie by the captain bunk in as good trim as ever -PRON- be 
a refreshing dip in cold spring water serve still further in give back to the young planter all -PRON- customary strength and vigor and when -PRON- have join the gilpin in a hearty breakfast -PRON- be prime for the road and eager to be about -PRON- work 
-PRON- have in mind a call at the house of samuel sparrow 
master plantation lie on both side of the river and -PRON- be rather two plantation than one each have -PRON- house and quarter but the master -PRON- live on the south shore 
if rotherick be to be believe the cronin have cross over to the north side thereby put a broad sweep of water between -PRON- and capt paul 
whether -PRON- be beyond the rappahannock still or have leave for other part since the night -PRON- have flee from capt plantation be the point the youth wish to settle by a call at master since mansion lie on -PRON- road to -PRON- own plantation capt paul would not be at much inconvenience in call there 
when the morning meal be do the young planter lose no time in take to the road 
-PRON- follow the highroad and not the bridle path 
have -PRON- desire -PRON- could have travel the latter course and thus have gain a final look at the relic of the robber roost which -PRON- have so successfully invade 
however -PRON- have no wish to return to the spot which have witness the explosion that have cost two of the robber -PRON- life and come so near to cost -PRON- -PRON- own 
there be a languid warmth even in that early hour and as -PRON- gallop through the heart of the thick wood redbird catbird and robin sing around -PRON- 
from some cause -PRON- hope mount high 
a feeling spring in -PRON- breast that all be not lose and that the messenger who be to call for the ebony box would ultimately receive -PRON- at -PRON- hand 
-PRON- would be difficult to account for this reassuring thought 
so far as the ebony box be concern the wile of mistress betsy seem to have be entirely successful 
nevertheless capt paul spur on with a more complacent spirit than -PRON- have have at any time since -PRON- have discover the loss of the paper 
by and by -PRON- draw rein at master door find master sparrow -PRON- enjoy a pipe on -PRON- veranda 
the gentleman greeting be sour and uncordial and -PRON- be plain -PRON- sad treatment at capt plantation still rankle in -PRON- bosom

goddard be uncle to all -PRON- man in the sense that give an avuncular character to every genial middleage person who look after the welfare of young employee 
in the early summer uncle sila have send a hundred horse into north dakota 
business have not be good and late fall find half the horse still outhand 
these horse be be winter at the morton ranch on marsh hay cut and stack by peter markham and reece bailey who have be send by uncle sila to take care of the horse herd 
when spring come there be a promise of turn off every head of the stock at a good profit 
the winter so far have not be particularly lonely for the montana man 
the snow of december have be light and -PRON- have be possible for th horse to paw out considerable forage in the hill 
january however bring in a good fall of the beautiful and -PRON- have be necessary to corral and shelter the animal and to go extensively into the feeding 
reese bailey uncle foreman find time to play cribbage with lance morton father and peter and nixon acquire leisure for skating and ski popular sport at -PRON- home ranch in the rockie 
a would have be a creek in a country of large through the morton holding and -PRON- glassy surface offer a resistless invitation to the steel runner 
as for the skiing there be plam and hill for run climbing and glissade 
while bailey and morton be busy at -PRON- eternal fifteentwo fifteenfour peter and markham be skate or skiing often with hesther who be fond of both sport 
the girl if appearance be to be believe be rather fond of markham also but have few smile to waste on peter 
in -PRON- bashful blundering way peter try to make -PRON- agreeable to hesther 
-PRON- be big and awkward however and have towcolore hair a slow wit and a few grace of speech or manner 
-PRON- effort to impress hesther be overwhelm by the never fail persiflage and the rakish dress and carriage of handsome porter markham 
markham posesse a confidence in -PRON- that be sublime a confidence that shine brilliantly in contrast with clumsy ineffectiveness of nixon peter 
peter realize this and nourish a bitter grudge against -PRON- physical and mental shortcoming 
-PRON- use to dream of a fire at the ranch in which -PRON- pose as a hero and bear the fair hesther to safety from the ranch house through a furnace of flame 
then in -PRON- vision hi picture the girl as take -PRON- hand and humbly ask -PRON- forgiveness for -PRON- failure to perceive -PRON- sterling quality from the first 
during such moment of illusion the saphead be almost happy 
but the ranch house never take fire and the chance to prove -PRON- a hero by rescue hesther morton be deny by fate 
in however an opportunity present -PRON- through the winter sport at lake 
markham and peter enter -PRON- in the skijumpe context and skate race 
-PRON- drive the fifty mile which separate from the lagke and hesther go with -PRON- to see the carnival of sport and to spend a night or two with relative in lake city 
again peter have dream but now on the homeward drive every hope be shatter and -PRON- long for for a period of blank obscurity and complete retirement 
-PRON- could have declare that one of -PRON- ski have be tamper with and that one of -PRON- skate strap have be all but cut through with the point of a knife 
examination make -PRON- sure of both fact yet -PRON- have not occur to -PRON- to sob 
-PRON- have blunder in not make certain of -PRON- ski and skate beforehand so -PRON- could not see how any one but -PRON- be at fault 
as -PRON- crouch in the back seat of the sleigh -PRON- consider request uncle silas goddard to recall -PRON- to the montana headquarters 
there at last -PRON- would be rid of markham and cut off forever from the demoralizing and disdainful eye of hesther 
yes -PRON- would go back to the home ranch and -PRON- would do this in spite of something which -PRON- know and which be very important to -PRON- future 
-PRON- be common knowledge that a place of preferment be to be give by uncle sila to either peter or to foremanship at a new ranch with a chance to acquire an interest in the horse and cattle 
reece bailey be watch peter and markham and on -PRON- report uncle sila would act 
to retire from the north dakota venture of the ranchowner now would cut peter off entirely from promotion and drop the plum in porter hand 
but peter in the bitterness of -PRON- heart be allow nothing aside form -PRON- own peace of mind to influence -PRON- 
yes -PRON- would ask uncle sila to recall -PRON- to montana 
-PRON- still there nix 
markham suddenly ask ture to look rearward 
peter grunt so blame quiet go on markham with a laugh that i reckon -PRON- may have take another header into the snow back a way on the trail 
hesther join in the laugh and in spirit poor peter writhe 
the short day be close and the sun go down beyond the white horizon in cold glory 
-PRON- be five mile form and markham have drive the horse so hard that -PRON- be nearly fag 
-PRON- breathe wheezingly and frost coated heaving side 
the place drag in spite of relentless use of the whip 
anyhow speak up peter suddenly -PRON- may think of the team a little porter near tucker do this driving cry markham never yet have to ask a saphead for advice in handle horse 
and again the whip fall on the strain flank 
peter clench -PRON- fist in the bearskin glove 
-PRON- occur to -PRON- that -PRON- could lift markham bodily out of the front seat take -PRON- place and do the driving -PRON- but -PRON- do not 
the horse struggle on and in the fall dark the traveler top a rise that give -PRON- a dim view of the building of ranch 
a light show in one of the ranchhouse window like a star and toward -PRON- markham drive and presently halt at the door 
now that handle the rein all the way from lake nix remark markham as -PRON- jump out and help hesther to alight allow -PRON- up to -PRON- to take care of the team 
cold essie 
not a bit the girl answer and hurry toward the door 
markham follow -PRON- and peter drive on to the stable 
as -PRON- unhitch and bring the horse into the shelter -PRON- be a little surprised to discover that there be no other animal in the place 
the team be but cow horse together with those of peter and markham should have be in the stable unless bailey be out oat the corral and shelter shed look after the fifty range horse that be keep up there 
peter light a lantern remove the harness from the horse and after put hay in the manger begin rub the animal down with an old gummy sack 
-PRON- be hard at this when a call reach -PRON- ear from the house peter 
this the jump 
-PRON- be voice and there be a note of alarm in -PRON- that startle peter 
lantern in hand -PRON- hurry out of the stable and make -PRON- way to the house 
fling the door wide -PRON- cross the threshold into the ranchhouse sit room wrong porter -PRON- ask 
the cannonball stove glow with heat 
that and the bright oil lamp dazzle eye for the moment and -PRON- could not see what be go on in the room 
bailey have be hurt come the voice of markham 
every horse in the herd wha be drive off by -PRON- even take mount with the rest 
big outrage that ever happen in these part like to know what the blame country be come to 
the blur lift from before peter eye 
-PRON- see bailey -PRON- face twist with pain lie on a couch 
mrs morton bend over -PRON- bathe a wound shoulder from a basin of hot water 
-PRON- husband be walk up and down fume and sputtering 
markham stand beside the couch look down at the foreman with a queer expression on -PRON- face 
hesther all excited be remove -PRON- wrap with shake hand 
horse steal gasp peter daze by the weird calamity 
how could -PRON- happen 
be bailey badly hurt stand there gawp fussed morton 
something have get to be do and -PRON- up to -PRON- and markham to do -PRON- 
a gang of scoundrel from across the line make off with the stock and -PRON- be no more than three hour since -PRON- happen 
take -PRON- team and go to roscommon 
the sheriff get to be notify 
bailey say the thief be make for the north and if -PRON- and markham be quick a posse can get between the gang and the boundary line 
for heavens sake peter wake up 
peter shake -PRON- put down the lantern and come to the side of the couch 
whey donot markham wake up -PRON- ask -PRON- suggest anything yet 
nothing to suggest markham answer flash a sharp look at peter twenty mile to roscommon and no chance of get there ahead of the thief and the steal stock 
the only animal -PRON- can put -PRON- hand on be the two that bring -PRON- from lake and -PRON- be do up 
-PRON- know that peter 
what about use skate or ski inquire peter 
by thunder there be a way of get to roscommon in time to help the sheriff head off the steal stock 
there be a dominant compelling note in the voice of peter 
-PRON- be so unexpected in -PRON- assertiveness that every one in the room be startle 
-PRON- washedout blue eye fence aggressively with the snap black eye of markham 
skate or ski repeat markham -PRON- upper lip curl 
why -PRON- all of thirty mile to roscommon if -PRON- follow the crook of the river 
and how much would -PRON- figure -PRON- by ski if -PRON- cross bear butte instead of go around -PRON- 
talk sense if -PRON- know how nix forget the fellow who rustle -PRON- stock have three hour the lead 
how far will three hour of drive in this snow get the steal herd return peter 
the thief will have a tough job of -PRON- 
-PRON- bailey twist -PRON- flushed face from under the minister hand of mrs morton 
the varmint be go north by the long knife dry wash -PRON- say -PRON- voice shake with the pain of -PRON- wound only three mile west of roscommon 
if -PRON- boy could get word to the sheriff somehow i reckon -PRON- may head off the raider with a posse 
but if -PRON- do anything -PRON- will have to do -PRON- quick 
porter and -PRON- eye swerve to markham look to si goddard be look to -PRON- 
nigh on to five thousand dollar worth of horse be be push towards the border and here helpless to do a thing 
-PRON- donot seem possible to do a thing reece return markham 
if -PRON- could round up a crown of man in short order and take after the thief on fresh horse like enough -PRON- may overhaul -PRON- 
but where s the ride stock 
why near neighbor be ten mile away 
peter flash a disapproving glance at markham pull off -PRON- bearskin glove and slump down in a chair by the stove 
from the pocket of -PRON- overcoat -PRON- take -PRON- skate also a new strap -PRON- have secure in lake city 
quickly -PRON- replace the broken strap with the new one 
-PRON- go to try and get to roscommon by river nix 
morton inquire figure the chance be well that way than go over bear butte on ski peter answer 
the river clean of snow and mostly the ice be like a lookingglass 
i be go to do -PRON- good to get word to the sheriff and to start a roscommon doctor this way to look after bailey 
-PRON- be locoed growl markham all right to get a doctor for reese here but there ainot a chance to save the stock this side of the line 
let the raider get -PRON- across the boundary and then take the matter up with the canadian mount police -PRON- advice 
if -PRON- wait till the stock be out of this country put in the rancher there wonot be a chance 
not a chance on earth agree bailey 
that outfit of thief know exactly what -PRON- be about 
everything be cut and dry and somebody sure tip -PRON- off regard the layout here bet a thousand against a chink wash ticket that -PRON- bronk will be take care of across the line sost -PRON- canot be locate by nobody 
-PRON- thief pick a time when i be alone at the shelter shed and porter and nix be to the winter sport at the lake 
-PRON- drop -PRON- out of -PRON- saddle without why s or wherefore and then make off with -PRON- mount and send a man to the stable for peter and ride horse 
by the time i cover the mile back to the ranch house the stock be ell on the way north 
-PRON- break off abruptly clench -PRON- tooth hard as a spasm of pain run through -PRON- body get another coat remark peter rise from -PRON- chair and start for the door that lead to -PRON- room 
-PRON- wonot be possible to make any kind of time in a long overcoat like this 
-PRON- disappear 
markham come to the side of the couch 
if peter have a chance reece say -PRON- hell make a bobble of some kind and spoil -PRON- all -PRON- way 
i better go to roscommon -PRON- 
peter can use -PRON- skate and take the river trail and use -PRON- ski and go over the butte 
i donot think -PRON- have a ghost of snow ahead of the stock but -PRON- up to -PRON- to see what -PRON- can do the talk exclaimed morton approvingly 
the thief have help from this ranch -PRON- add darkly toss a significant glance toward the door through which peter just pass and i havenot get a whole lot of confidence peter be square bailey aver 
square as a die 
-PRON- j donot seem to have the knack for puttin -PRON- idee across 
the man that save -PRON- bronk porter -PRON- add significantly be go to make the big kind of a hit with goddard 
if any one connect with the sheriff at roscommon in time to save the bronk markham return -PRON- will be -PRON- 
-PRON- speak with a confidence that thrill every one in the room and hesther if the red in -PRON- cheek and the sparkle in -PRON- eye be any indication most of all be ready -PRON- finish move toward the door in about two shake 
-PRON- must have some hot coffee before -PRON- start say hesther and see that -PRON- be ready for -PRON- 
markham be back in the room before peter have reappear 
-PRON- wear a leather coat and the bottom of -PRON- trouser be lace inside -PRON- high shoe top 
trim and handsome -PRON- look and ready for a grueling night work 
hesther be just place the coffee on the table and -PRON- lift -PRON- eye to flash a glance of admiration at the young ski runner be ready in a minute essie say markham with a nod and a smile 
take -PRON- ski from a corner of the room -PRON- sit down lay -PRON- across -PRON- knee and proceed to grease -PRON- well from a can which -PRON- have bring into the room and have place on the stove 
while -PRON- work peter come lumber in 
peter have don a ragged sweater whose collar come up around -PRON- ear 
over this be button a faded and threadbare coat 
-PRON- oldfashione skate be under -PRON- arm 
from beneath the rim of -PRON- motheaten fur cap -PRON- tow hair show in a sort of fringe 
the cap have ear flap with string at -PRON- end 
the flap be loose and the string flutter as -PRON- move -PRON- head 
-PRON- shoe be of cowhide strong and serviceable but not at all ornamental 
-PRON- have tie the bottom of -PRON- trouser to -PRON- ankle with piece of cord 
the contrast between peter and markham be very striking 
so far as appearance go markham have -PRON- on peter by about a hundred to one go too nix observe markham lay -PRON- ski to one side go over the butte and get a month pay that say i beat -PRON- into roscommon 
maybe -PRON- will return peter start for the outside door 
there be more bitterness in peters heart 
-PRON- believe -PRON- understand the situation 
markham have win the ski jump and the skating race and now -PRON- want to round off -PRON- triumph by be first to carry the news of the horse thieve to the sheriff 
markham be plan a spectacular bit of work for uncle si goddard incidentally 
mainly -PRON- be think of the effect of -PRON- night success on hesth morton 
wait nixon call mrs morton 
essie have get some hot coffee ready and -PRON- must have a cup before -PRON- leave 
the rancher wife be the only one who ever give much thought to peter 
-PRON- consider -PRON- now when the consideration and confidence of the other seem to center wholly in markham 
much oblige mrs morton peter answer but i donot reckon take the time 
-PRON- see -PRON- add as -PRON- lay a hand on the doorknob a case where every minute count 
before the good woman could answer the door have close behind peter 
markham pull up -PRON- shoulder in a shrug as -PRON- lift the cup of steam coffee first blunder -PRON- remark 
-PRON- have a habit of go -PRON- blind and without give any preparation to the work ahead of -PRON- hope -PRON- wonot meet with any accident murmur mrs morton 
that boy get a good heart even if -PRON- be a little odd always be a blunder and a saphead grunt -PRON- husband 
if the steal horse be recover -PRON- will be markham who make -PRON- possible 
markham do not tarry long over -PRON- coffee 
within a few moment after peter leave -PRON- be out in the nipping air 
hesther a shawl over -PRON- head step through the doorway to watch while -PRON- cross the trampled snow around the ranch house and then knelt to thrust the toe of -PRON- shoe in the bilgeri binding of the ski and to buckle the ankle strap 
-PRON- arise presently and shout a farewell to the girl glide away over the snowy level gracefully swiftly with -PRON- ski stick bite into the snow and propel -PRON- onward do a man work this night murmur hesther and -PRON- will as -PRON- win at lake city carnival 
then -PRON- go back into the house to describe in detail how peter have lose and markham have win in the winter sport contest at the lake 
river have many twist and turn in the thirty mile which -PRON- cover between ranch and roscommon 
pass within a stone throw of the ranch house -PRON- flow almost due north for six mile then enter the rough hill country -PRON- double back on -PRON- course for three mile round the base of bluff in a fourmile curve come east by south around the base of bear butte and then curve in a northwesterly direction for the last twelve mile that carry -PRON- through the outskirt of the county seat 
markham on -PRON- ski could con a direct course to roscommon bisect the river at three point and finally climb the butte for a long glissade into the town 
that glissade right into the edge of the settlement measure ten mile of down grade 
the slope of bear butte be smooth and directly under -PRON- crest the descent be steep 
a mile of this and then the course fall away more gently 
markham if -PRON- make good time to the eastern base of bear butte would very likely reach that particular spot ahead of peter for -PRON- would have to travel only seven mile while peter be go sixteen 
where markham would lose would be in climb the butte and where -PRON- would make up -PRON- loss would be in the long glissade down the opposite side 
at the river edge peter screw the skate into -PRON- heel pull the strap tight and buckle -PRON- then put on -PRON- bearskin glove and strike out 
-PRON- be well away toward bluff before markham make -PRON- first crossing of the river near the ranch house 
the ice be in splendid condition 
a strong wind have sweep -PRON- clean of loose snow save here and there at the turn where drift have form 
then a slight thaw a few day before have be follow by a tightening of the cold and all rough spot have be smooth away 
markham whose steel runner be the very last word in allmetal skate excel as a figure skater 
-PRON- could cut all sort of graceful figure on the ice and with hesther morton would do a sort of waltz which the girl seem to consider rare sport 
peter on the other hand be not proficient at that sort of thing 
-PRON- prefer straight skate possibly because -PRON- realize that fancy caper be quite out of -PRON- line 
the steel wood and leather with which -PRON- be shod seem best adapt to straightaway work anyhow 
peter know every foot of the river between the ranch and roscommon 
-PRON- have cover that long stretch of ice several time while get -PRON- in trim for the skating race at lake 
there be white ice under the shelter of the bluff and the butte cause by a fall of snow while the first crystal be form 
this have be full of air bubble and have be treacherous up to the time the severe frost have follow the thaw 
after that the liquefy snow have congeal into a sound and superlative smoothness 
there be not a spot to be fear on the entire course 
with long steady swinging stroke peter sweep around the first turn and come south on the stretch which markham be to cross in order to thread a seam through bluff 
but although the moonlight be brilliant upon the sparkle snow crust -PRON- could see nothing of -PRON- rival 
-PRON- may be -PRON- reason that markham have already effect -PRON- second crossing of the river and be even then in the gash that cut through the bluff 
peter grind -PRON- tooth and with -PRON- runner ring musically pass like a gliding specter around the bluff base 
three mile farther and -PRON- may obtain a view of markham as -PRON- emerge from the shallow defile and push over the open level toward the butte 
-PRON- be have queer thought about markham 
why have the fellow protest against any attempt to reach roscommon and notify the sheriff 
then in the face of -PRON- protest why have -PRON- determine to pit -PRON- ski against peter accomplish the thing which -PRON- have aver could not be accomplish 
there be but one answer to this accord to peter conclusion 
markham could not bear to think that peter may succeed that -PRON- may win favorable notice from uncle sila and that -PRON- may gain some credit in the eye of hesther morton 
markham be not think of save the horse no -PRON- be impress with the idea of -PRON- own prestige and importance and -PRON- could not take a chance of lose out to a saphead 
that be all there be to -PRON- so peter believe 
a determination to win that race and save the steal stock grow strong and strong in peter breast 
here after the miserable failure at lake be a most unexpected opportunity to retrieve -PRON- 
-PRON- be -PRON- business to make the most of -PRON- 
three straight mile lay ahead of -PRON- to the westward of the bluff 
come down the stretch like the wind -PRON- survey the shadowy opening of the swale in the hope of catch a glimpse of markham 
but the ski runner be not in sight 
in the distance the sparkle crest of bear butte could be vaguely determine yet between the bluff and the butte no dusky figure could be see toil on the ski 
-PRON- hasnot clear the bluff yet think peter exultantly lead -PRON- by ginger 
the river at the end of the threemile stretch describe a curve like a gigantic horseshoe 
in -PRON- first begin the stream have attempt to run west by south meet the rough country -PRON- course have be deflect toward the northwest then strike the widespreading base of bear butte -PRON- have follow northeast and east on -PRON- way around the huge uplift 
on clear the butte the puyallup strike off due northwest and so in a dozen mile come to roscommon 
peter although -PRON- have not time -PRON- know -PRON- have be make excellent speed 
-PRON- be seventeen mile from the ranch and come rapidly under the shadow of the butte 
markham could scarcely climb the massive rise and glissade into roscommon ahead of -PRON- 
so far as -PRON- have be able to discover markham be not yet anywhere near bear butte i say peter 
peter be amazed 
above -PRON- ringing steel a sharp cry echo in the frosty air 
-PRON- be voice and call -PRON- name 
peter dig into the ice with the heel of -PRON- runner and come to a quick halt 
that -PRON- porter -PRON- call 
yes nix in hard luck 
stop a minute will -PRON- 
the voice come from a shadowy overhang at the butte foot 
peter skate toward the black cavity and be meet by the dusky figure of markham limp out of the darkness and across the ice 
markham have -PRON- ski under -PRON- arm 
by george cry peter 
-PRON- get here in a hurry wrong fall from a sixfoot bank as i be cross the river and splinter one of -PRON- ski be the answer and i canot go on with the wood runner 
i reckon take -PRON- skate markham add coolly 
peter catch -PRON- breath reckon -PRON- wonot -PRON- return with spirit go on to roscommon start the sheriff and a posse for the dry wash and get a doctor for bailey 
what do -PRON- take -PRON- for a plain everyday saphead say markham 
down on the ice peter and off with those skate 
pronto be the word no time to lose 
markham have drop the ski and strip a glove from -PRON- right hand 
the bare hand be in the pocket of -PRON- leather coat 
suddenly as the two stand face each other the hand emerge from the pocket with a short uglylooking bulldog revolver 
markham level the weapon and the moonlight glint frostily on the barrel 
again peter catch -PRON- breath 
-PRON- be daze bewilder 
to be threaten in that manner by one whom -PRON- have believe to be a friendor if not a friend at least a fellow employee of uncle silas goddard with interest in a decided shock 
-PRON- crazy porter demand peter when -PRON- could find -PRON- tongue 
hardly be the reply with a husky illomene laugh -PRON- will be a long time before -PRON- reach roscommon -PRON- laddybuck 
take off those skate i tell -PRON- 
i mean business peter 
there be that in word and manner which leave no doubt of the fact that -PRON- mean business 
peter be wild with indignation and anger but -PRON- be also helpless 
reece bailey say to this when i tell -PRON- -PRON- ask drop to the ice and work at the skate strap cross that bridge when -PRON- get to -PRON- be the response 
throw the skate over here when -PRON- get -PRON- off 
-PRON- have to butt into this deal with the fool suggestion of get word to the sheriff now blame -PRON- take -PRON- medicine bind to win grunt peter if -PRON- have to do -PRON- with a gun 
-PRON- ainot square markham 
i may be a good deal of a saphead but i find when -PRON- be too late that one of -PRON- ski and one of -PRON- skate strap have be tamper with at lake 
-PRON- do that 
why didnot -PRON- tell hesther about -PRON- jeer markham or the judge of the contest -PRON- have nerve enough to put up a holler 
peter give the skate a shove across the ice 
ten foot away markham sit down to screw the skate to -PRON- heel and adjust the strap 
the revolver lie at -PRON- side and -PRON- watch peter sharply as -PRON- work 
peter a desperate purpose form in -PRON- mind be await the moment when -PRON- could spring to the attack 
-PRON- be not to be conquer in that way 
there be plenty of fight in -PRON- and markham would discover -PRON- to -PRON- cost 
markham work rapidly 
the skate be on and snugly buckle and -PRON- be just rise when peter go after -PRON- with a short run and a slide 
but if peter be quick markham be a shade quicker 
crack the revolver explode in the air and peter left arm seem suddenly to have be scorch with a hot iron 
the shock cause -PRON- to lose -PRON- footing and -PRON- fall in a sprawl on the slippery surface of the river 
-PRON- would have -PRON- shout markham fiercely something more for -PRON- to tell bailey 
the last word fade in mellow ring of slide steel 
peter sit up on the ice and clasp -PRON- numbed arm with -PRON- right hand watch markham slip from sight around the curve at the foot of bear butte 
peter be think less of the pain in -PRON- arm than -PRON- be of the rascally work of peter markham 
the fellow must be mad to make such an attack 
-PRON- have plan the whole thing of course and have arm -PRON- before leave reach the butte ahead of peter -PRON- have go into hiding against the moment peter should come skate down the river 
then by way of make -PRON- treachery more contemptible -PRON- have call to peter for help only to threaten -PRON- with a revolver and steal -PRON- skate 
-PRON- bet tell bailey mutter peter reckon thisll cook -PRON- goose with goddard even if -PRON- do get to roscommon in time to have the sheriff head off the bronk 
what can a fellow make of a man like -PRON- act thataway 
with difficulty peter remove -PRON- coat and shove up the shirt and sweater sleeve 
the wound be in the forearm and be bleed profusely 
with a bandanna handkerchief -PRON- bind up the injury tightly knot the handkerchief corner with -PRON- finger and -PRON- tooth then get into -PRON- coat again -PRON- begin consider -PRON- next move 
-PRON- be twelve mile by river to roscommon and eighteen mile back to the ranch 
even if -PRON- be now useless for -PRON- to get to the town in order to carry the news of the horse steal to the sheriff return to would have be a fierce pull on -PRON- strength and -PRON- dare not attempt -PRON- 
-PRON- would make -PRON- way to roscommon 
if -PRON- could reach the settlement before markham leave -PRON- -PRON- would lodge a complaint against the treacherous scoundrel and have -PRON- hold in the town jail 
peter be burn for revenge 
yes that be what -PRON- would do 
-PRON- get up feel a little dizzy and faint and start down the river 
-PRON- foot strike against ski and another idea come to -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- could tinker up the splintered ski and use the runner 
after the accident that have lose -PRON- the jump at lake peter have buy a little fine wire for the mending of -PRON- own broken runner 
that wire be still in -PRON- trouser pocket and -PRON- may be that -PRON- could use -PRON- in fix splintered ski 
pick up both runner and hold the damage one between -PRON- knee -PRON- strike a match and make a careful examination 
the stout ash have be crack under the bind mechanism 
a few wrap of fine wire may yet make the runner serve 
with -PRON- jackknife peter dig a shallow groove across the ski bottom and in this -PRON- imbed the half dozen coil of wire that -PRON- wove over and over and make fast on the upper surface 
for -PRON- -PRON- have never fancy that bilgeri bind 
although light and well make -PRON- be not nearly so strong or dependable as the lilienfield bind with which peter own ski be equip 
peter work have be do at a tremendous disadvantage 
-PRON- could work with one hand only and in lieu of -PRON- other hand -PRON- make shift to use -PRON- tooth 
the moon although brilliant leave much to be desire in the matter of light for such fine and exact labor and sense of touch have to help -PRON- where that of sight fail 
in the main however -PRON- do very well all thing consider and when -PRON- have secure -PRON- foot in the binding -PRON- arise on the ash runner with a feeling of exultation in -PRON- breast 
where be the stick 
-PRON- search for -PRON- carry -PRON- to the overhang and there -PRON- find not only the ski stick but two strip of gunny sack each heavily knot in the middle 
those strip of sack rather puzzle peter 
markham have bring -PRON- as an aid in get up the steep eastern slope of the butte 
but why have -PRON- prepare -PRON- with -PRON- if -PRON- object be to waylay peter and secure the skate 
markham always figure a matter out both way peter reflect 
-PRON- bring the gun to help corral the skate but if i happen to beat -PRON- to the butte then -PRON- would have to keep right on over the rise 
if -PRON- couldnot do one thing then -PRON- be ready to do the other more -PRON- splinter that ski apurpose and -PRON- didnot do -PRON- until -PRON- know i be behind -PRON- at the overhang 
-PRON- didnot want -PRON- to have a chance to use the ski that s all 
-PRON- never occur to -PRON- that have something along to use in patchin up the runner once anyhow that a saphead fool -PRON- 
peter shuffle -PRON- way to a point beyond the overhang then pause to tie the strip of cloth around the ski knot side down 
this maneuver would help to keep -PRON- from slide backward 
-PRON- flash an upward look at the difficult grade -PRON- be to negotiate 
if -PRON- heart fail -PRON- for a moment because of -PRON- useless arm and the shock -PRON- whole body have suffer because of the wound -PRON- only result in let -PRON- get a firm grip on -PRON- resolution and strength 
the wound be nothing serious be merely a clean gash through the fleshy part of the forearm 
-PRON- would not allow -PRON- to endanger the success of -PRON- night exploit 
markham must be make to suffer for -PRON- lawlessness and -PRON- be up to peter to see that -PRON- do not escape 
the first easy slope of the butte be take just as one may travel over level forward movement in long gliding step 
the ski be merely advanced never lift 
as the ascent stiffen peter turn out the end of the runner slightly in what be know as the half fishbone step 
there be a trick in this and peter have long since acquire -PRON- 
steep and steeper become the course as the snowy slope be climb and the full fishbone step be gradually bring into requisition 
for such a long ascent the work be extremely tiring and peter be force to do a number of serpentine tack back and forth and execute the difficult about face at each turn 
a good deal of time be require in make the climb but peter handicap of awkwardness have teach -PRON- how to be patient and doggedly resolute in carry out -PRON- aim 
-PRON- keep unflinchingly to -PRON- tiresome task and in due course be reward by find -PRON- on the flat crest of bear butte ready for the long glissade 
by this time -PRON- sport blood be arouse and -PRON- look forward with keen enjoyment to the breathlessly swift glide that lie ahead of -PRON- 
-PRON- rest a few moment tuck the hand of -PRON- injured arm into the front of -PRON- coat remove the knot strip from the runner take firm hold of the ski stick and then let -PRON- over the butte crest 
with ski so close together that -PRON- touch the point of one lead the other by a foot body not bent but incline forward peter be off down the steep slope like a bullet out of a gun 
-PRON- be at a disadvantage in not have both hand for use with the stick 
where -PRON- be necessary to brake and avoid a small crevasse or a bowlder peter do -PRON- entirely with the ski by execute the telemark swing 
-PRON- be not often that -PRON- be confront by such an emergency but -PRON- be proficient in that method of dodge possible disaster and unhesitatingly avail -PRON- of -PRON- 
at lightning speed -PRON- shoot down the butte the air hum in -PRON- ear and snowy particle sting -PRON- face 
-PRON- exhilaration mount high and high 
in -PRON- delight over the coasting -PRON- forget the steal horse the treachery of markham and the reprisal -PRON- be count upon when -PRON- should reach roscommon 
-PRON- every faculty be call into play and busy -PRON- with the fly ski to the exclusion of everything else 
the slope flatten and peter speed lessen perceptibly although -PRON- be still go at a rate comparable to that of a limited express train 
on and on mile after mile -PRON- sensation be that of one fall through space 
-PRON- scarcely realize that -PRON- have any connection whatever with the whiteclad earth beneath -PRON- 
at last in the distance -PRON- see a twinkling light and a confused blur of building 
roscommon 
the town jump toward -PRON- as though crazily bent on foul -PRON- course 
-PRON- give rather more attention to roscommon than to the slope ahead of -PRON- and suddenly -PRON- pitch into the air as the runner hit an obstacle 
-PRON- fall with the ski braid around -PRON- neck fall hard upon the clear track of the roscommon railroad yard and so suddenly that -PRON- have no time to realize -PRON- have go over the embankment at the side of the network of rail 
instinctively -PRON- try to lift -PRON- only to drop in an awkward huddle with a blaze of shoot star crisscross before -PRON- eye 
then the bright light fade and nixon peter quietly go to sleep 
when peter awake -PRON- find -PRON- on a bench in the railroad station 
a local train be expect and there have be man on the station platform when peter shoot over the railroad embankment and hit the track 
three or four of the man go forward to investigate the strange phenomenon and -PRON- be the one who have bring peter into the waiting room 
-PRON- have no more than lay -PRON- down and strip off -PRON- ski when -PRON- open -PRON- eye 
sheriff go to the dry wash yet -PRON- inquire faintly 
a man bent over -PRON- 
jordan the sheriff say -PRON- 
what dry wash do -PRON- mean 
why should i go there 
markham reach town go on peter see a thing of markham 
oh 
jordan exclaim know -PRON- now 
-PRON- be man peter from the morton ranch 
why be -PRON- slide into town at this time o night on a pair of ski 
thunder 
-PRON- be as much as -PRON- life be worth 
-PRON- gang of horse thief run off -PRON- fifty of -PRON- cut in peter wildly 
-PRON- happen early in the evening 
get a posse jordan and head off the gang at long knife dry wash 
when markham show up leave somebody in town to arrest -PRON- 
-PRON- shoot -PRON- in the arm 
and send a doctor to to look after bailey wound too 
then peter go to sleep again 
when -PRON- next come to -PRON- and pick up the chain of event -PRON- be in a bed in a room at the roscommon house 
broad day look in at the room window and peter could gaze dreamily out at roof cover with snow and sparkle under the sun ray as though cover with diamond 
hour have pass since -PRON- have have the brief awakening in the railroad station 
now -PRON- be in a comfortable bed -PRON- left arm neatly bandage and toynbee the proprietor of the hotel be sit beside -PRON- 
do -PRON- get markham toynbee ask peter 
the landlord be read a newspaper 
-PRON- jump in -PRON- chair as the unexpected word reach -PRON- from the bed 
oh -PRON- be back eh say -PRON- be a long time on the road although the doctor say -PRON- neednot to mind 
get markham 
well i guess 
and toynbee chuckle 
jordan get -PRON- and four other along with the steal horse 
-PRON- be push through the dry wash when the sheriff and -PRON- party arrive there 
-PRON- bet -PRON- get -PRON- peter and redhande at that 
big surprise to everybody 
why markham have put the whole thing up 
-PRON- be back of the entire scheme 
-PRON- have all come out 
markham wonot talk but the rest of the gang feel different 
across the line there be man wait to take the horse and rush -PRON- off where -PRON- would never be find 
say 
i guess -PRON- ought to have a medal for what -PRON- do last night 
how be -PRON- feel anyhow 
peter be stunned 
porter markham one of the horse thief 
could peter believe -PRON- ear 
markham have have a reason for drive the horse off -PRON- foot on the return from lake 
with all the other stock take from -PRON- have be plan to make the sleigh team useless so far as a drive of twenty mile to roscommon with news for the sheriff be concerned and markham have protest against peter plan of use skate in carry an alarm to roscommon but when the method have be put into effect in spite of -PRON- markham have take to the ski and have waylay peter at the eastern foot of bear butte 
in the light of recent event the motive for that attack could be see at an even more treacherous angle scheme be not to beat peter to roscommon with news for the sheriff but to keep all knowledge of the robbery from the authority until the steal horse have be deliver across the line 
instead of make for the town after secure peter skate markham have follow the river bend beyond the town to a point where -PRON- could join -PRON- rascally confederate with the horse herd 
how do -PRON- feel peter repeat toynbee after wait a long time for a reply 
mighty nigh locoed say peter 
no wonder 
say -PRON- hit the railroad iron with -PRON- head when -PRON- go over the embankment 
any other head but -PRON- would probably have be crack 
-PRON- canot crack a saphead comment peter but not in bitterness 
next day when peter be think of get out of -PRON- bed and help drive the horse back to the ranch no less a person than uncle silas goddard walk into -PRON- room 
uncle sila be an irongray man big and broad and with a regular heart under -PRON- rib 
-PRON- have receive a telegram sign reece bailey per morton and have come to north dakota by first train 
there be greeting not those of a pleased employer for a worthy employee but more in line with what one next of kin may say in circumstance altogether creditable 
bailey be come fine and would be on the job again in two or three week and peter the doctor say would be fit as a fiddle in seven day at the outside 
the horse be on the way back to what about markham query peter 
uncle silas cheery face grow troubled 
well markham be only a boy and a very foolish one 
-PRON- have have a hard lesson 
no stock have be lose and uncle sila feel that -PRON- ought not to be too hard on markham 
-PRON- be go to let markham go on a promise to leave the country and make something of -PRON- in other part 
any one at all acquaint with uncle sila may have know -PRON- would do that very thing 
as for -PRON- nixon the big ranchowner go on a job wait in montana for a chap of -PRON- heft and disposition 
but do -PRON- want to return to the home ranch -PRON- ask quizzically 
miss hesth morton send a very kindly message to -PRON- by -PRON- 
-PRON- be sorry for a lot of thing -PRON- say and hope to see -PRON- right soon 
but nixon peter have see another light 
-PRON- recall -PRON- saphead dream of rescue hesther from a burn house and the shame red stain -PRON- cheek to the towcolored hair 
miss morton all at once be waste -PRON- consideration on the wrong party 
uncle sila say peter for montana as soon as -PRON- want -PRON- there 
good exclaimed uncle sila and clasped peter hand with a fervor that suggest not only good will but hearty congratulation 

cast away at the pole by author of little miss vassar the cotton bag the et cetera 
a -PRON- situation be not only hopeless but demoralize as well 
i realize this when i catch the professor look at -PRON- with hard and hungry eye 
what ail -PRON- prebble 
i ask straiglitene out the sleep bag with -PRON- numb finger 
-PRON- body crave nutrition -PRON- answer huskily must eat 
have -PRON- forgoiten that -PRON- divide the last ounce of pemmican yesterday 
how could i forget -PRON- i reply with this dreadful gnawing at -PRON- stomach to serve as a constant reminder something must be do -PRON- companion declare with convulsive energy 
but what 
i return 
here -PRON- be lose on the ice cap abandon by -PRON- eskimo guide sle go dog go compass break and nothing to eat but -PRON- sealskin clothe 
something must be do -PRON- say and i agree with -PRON- fully 
-PRON- join this expedition to solve problem 
solve this one 
that should have floor prebble 
but -PRON- do not have already solve this oneto -PRON- own satisfaction say -PRON- 
and again that hard and hungry look be turn on -PRON- 
what be -PRON- think of 
i demand angrily 
-PRON- give a cackling illtime laugha laugh that irritate -PRON- beyond word 
the old law of the survival of the fit will apply here -PRON- say 
in -PRON- dash for the pole captain -PRON- have attain the farth north and i have demonstrate the truth of the meteoric theory of the aurora borealis 
if i go back i can tell what -PRON- have do but -PRON- if -PRON- return to civilization without -PRON- could no more tell of -PRON- discovery than discourse in attic greek 
ergo return 
i know what -PRON- mean well enough 
but i be notready to serve as a diet for the professor even at the command of science and as for eke out -PRON- own miserable existence with a ragout la prebble iwould as soon have think of bolt the rule of three crazy i say shiveringly 
consistent -PRON- dear fellow 
see here i go on behind -PRON- be the ship and the ship crew 
when the eskimo guide get back without -PRON- search party will be send out and well be find 
but suppose the eskimo guide donot get back choose to think that -PRON- will i respond firmly not go to yield up -PRON- life to -PRON- and -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora flat -PRON- a thought beyond -PRON- own selfish aim and ambition prebble return indignantly 
possibly i have i fling back at -PRON- tartly but i refuse to throw -PRON- away on a little old professor with a bee in -PRON- bonnet 
that be a shot that go home 
the professor sink into a morbid silence 
besides i proceed farth north doesnot satisfy -PRON- 
i shall attain the only point on this earth where the compass have but three cardinal point east west and south 
the north pole -PRON- exclaim 
madman shall attain -PRON- i fepeatd warm olow of enthusiasm pulse through -PRON- hungry body shall plant -PRON- country flag at the apex of the earth 
what good will -PRON- do vour country or any other country -PRON- ask 
-PRON- talk strangely professor i say frigidly will the discovery of the north pole benefit mankind or advance civilization a single inch consider the luster of the achievement sir 
luster of the achievement irabile dictu 
not only that i go on wave -PRON- mittened hand in a direction i believe to be south but somewhere behind -PRON- be that execrable griffyn englishman sir who have swear to beat -PRON- to the pole 
have -PRON- no pride no patriotism i have both say prebble plaintively 
i be hungry 
hungry 
the insolence of this professor fill -PRON- with wrath unutterable 
i tower above -PRON- and give -PRON- a look that send -PRON- crouch to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- lift -PRON- hand appealingly 
-PRON- nose sir say -PRON- be very white 
i leave off glare at -PRON- pick up a handful of snow and begin rub -PRON- nose 
by the time circulation be restore i find the professor have crawl into the sleep bag so i crawl in beside -PRON- thankful -PRON- have warm -PRON- up 
this particular bag be a threeman bag that be capable of hold three adult 
-PRON- be shape like an envelope opening from end to end be make of reindeer skin and have an outer covering of oiltanned sealskin the latter keep out the water and keeping in the animal heat 
i fasten the flap over the opening 
then prebble bade -PRON- an ironical good night 
the professor good night may have be ironical because of one of two thing either because of -PRON- resentment toward -PRON- or at that time of the year in the arctic continual day reign and there be no night 
which be the great achievement prebble i ask find the pole or demonstrate the truth of a meteoric theory 
there be no comparison captain salis 
find the north pole be simply a matter of brute endurance but demonstrate the truth of that theory sir involve forth all the good power of the mind 
bah sir 
i cry 
bah to -PRON- -PRON- retort 
there and then i make a mental vow that the next time i go explore in the arctic i would use more care in select the scientific member of the expedition 
prebble have a string of letter after -PRON- name abbreviate -PRON- honorable suffix and extend -PRON- to sit with the highbrow but -PRON- be about as sociable as a polar bear 
-PRON- have say good night merely to open -PRON- mutfle canversation in the sleep bag 
sometimes -PRON- be like thata human movingpicture film run through the lantern wrong end to 
i have bakd -PRON- in the hope of cut short -PRON- garrulity 
but the effort fail 
suppose -PRON- find the pole say -PRON- how be -PRON- go to know when -PRON- get there 
for a professor of -PRON- attainment observe frigidly that remark be asinine 
-PRON- cackle jeeringly 
how be -PRON- go to make sure -PRON- be at the north pole when -PRON- get there -PRON- repeat with madden insistence 
by observation 
i snap vouch for the accuracy of -PRON- observation 
-PRON- will 
-PRON- havenot any sympathy with -PRON- aim or aspiration prebble but -PRON- will have to support -PRON- in a matter of truth and verity 
if -PRON- donot -PRON- scientific reputation will suffer 
once more -PRON- cackle have be make mental note and draw deduction -PRON- proceed and from -PRON- study of human activity in the frozen world i venture a most remarkable but most scientific conclusion 
do -PRON- care to hear -PRON- 
if -PRON- have discover anything remarkable i score the event be sufficiently unique to command -PRON- attention 
out with -PRON- prebble 
listen -PRON- return in -PRON- most didactic tone 
the basis of all observation that be to command the respect and confidence of the learn public be embrace in the old statement of mei sana in corpore sanoa sound mind in a sound body 
in use -PRON- artificial horizon and work out -PRON- position -PRON- must approach the task with every faculty alert and unclouded 
certainly agree 
sali -PRON- declare no human being can undergo the awful peril and hardship of polar discovery without an overthrow of -PRON- mental poise 
bosh 
i cry 
derision say -PRON- be the fool answer to an argument prove nothing and lead nowherc 
do -PRON- mean to say i demand that i will not keep -PRON- reason 
-PRON- have not keep -PRON- -PRON- friend 
even now with the pole still far away the intense cold the terrific physical strain and the insufficient food have throw -PRON- off -PRON- mental balance 
-PRON- be not -PRON- and -PRON- have not be -PRON- for several day 
-PRON- discovery along this line lead -PRON- to propound a theory of polar aberration 
the other day -PRON- call the white snow purple 
that be a chromatic proof of fail reason rage fill -PRON- rage and indignation 
prebble cry -PRON- be the one who be lose -PRON- mind 
-PRON- another proof -PRON- continue calmly be -PRON- obstinate refusal to listen to -PRON- highly valuable suggestion 
if -PRON- mind be uncloude -PRON- would profit by -PRON- very excellent advice 
if -PRON- have -PRON- sense i answer -PRON- wouldnot think of turn cannibal merely to enable -PRON- to get back to civilization and propound -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora 
desperate strait require desperate remedy -PRON- insist 
if -PRON- be to propound such a desperate remedy back home how long would -PRON- be before -PRON- be clap intoa straitjacket a remedy would not be propound back home -PRON- would not be necessary mad as a hatter 
i tell himand i be really begin to think so 
when a mind fail say -PRON- -PRON- be a fact of record that -PRON- believe every other mind have fail 
sali more and more -PRON- prove -PRON- contention 
the fact of record i return apply both way 
-PRON- think crazy and i know -PRON- be 
i shall discover the pole and shall convince the learn public that i have discover -PRON- 
when i get out of this bag and the ink in -PRON- fountain pen be thaw out so i can write with -PRON- put down the substance of -PRON- remark in -PRON- diary hope so -PRON- answer 
and i hope -PRON- will put -PRON- down exactly as i make -PRON- 
in -PRON- present deplorable condition however i presume that be ask too much 
thereupon -PRON- roll to one side of the bag and i roll to the other 
there be a coldness between -PRON- 
strange how little thing conspire to shape -PRON- destine here below 
but for the space which mutual intolerance place between the professor and -PRON- in that threeman sleep bag one or both of -PRON- would have be sacrifice and -PRON- sleep would have be a sleep of death 
i remember reflect bitterly on -PRON- hapless lot and dozing off by degree the professor snore fade on -PRON- ear and at last die away utterly 
how long i sleep i have no means of know but suddenly i be awaken by such a tremendous shock as i never expect to experience again and live the end of the frozen bag be bent toward each other with a great crackling so that insfead of lie prostrate i be in a sit position thrust one hand toward side of the bag only to encounter a partition of deerskin 
what have happen 
the sleep bag have suddenly acquire motionnot over the rough surface of the ice cap but apparently throughthe air 
i have a thought which chill -PRON- blood 
have the bag slip over a precipice at the edge of the ice cap 
and be -PRON- fall fall but no this could not be 
there be no precipice at the edge of the ice cap and the theory be untenable 
besides if -PRON- have be fall -PRON- would have strike something long since 
have -PRON- notice captain that -PRON- have a concentric and a lateral as well as a forward motion prebble exclaim 
be -PRON- alive 
keenly sir 
this be a most astounding phenomenon 
i now discover that the partition of reindeer hide separate the professor from -PRON- consist of a fold of the sleep bag push inward as by some hard substance 
what do -PRON- think be go on i ask 
-PRON- gyratory motion suggest a hurricane -PRON- answer 
-PRON- may be that -PRON- have be catch off the top of the ice cap by an arctic whirlwind 
can -PRON- open the flap captain 
i could and do after some little trouble 
the lengthwise slit be in front of -PRON- and -PRON- be able to look through -PRON- without a change of position 
the view be not satisfactory for a great white cloud envelop -PRON- and make -PRON- impossible to see very far in any direction 
-PRON- be suspend in gray space and move with frightful rapidity 
as -PRON- gaze out into the void a black object come rush from overhead graze the side of the sleep bag and vanish below 
-PRON- be over in a flash so quickly in fact that neither i nor -PRON- companion could determine what manner of thing the object be 
merciful power gasp 
-PRON- be bound upward muse prebble as well as onward 
can -PRON- imagine what that thing be 
i query 
possibly a missile of meteoric origin 
-PRON- be more athletic than i be captain and donot -PRON- think -PRON- could get an upward look without fall from the bag 
i crane -PRON- neck outside 
the next instang an exclamation escape -PRON- lip 
what do -PRON- see ask prebble eagerly rope 
suspend from what canot see 
the object -PRON- hang from be lose in the cloud 
by the mizzenffuck of the gr harry 
what now 
i have make a discovery that almost cause -PRON- hair to stand on end 
this sleep bag be catch on the fluke of an anchor see i see 
the sleping bag be scoop up bodily the fluke catch -PRON- in the center 
-PRON- weight on one side and -PRON- weight on the other balance the bag 
beautiful beautiful 
some aronaut be make for the pole by balloonhis drag rope sweep the ice capthe anchor catch -PRON- 
the object that dart downward a moment ago be a sandbag throw from the balloon to offset -PRON- add weight 
most remarkable 
prebble be chuckle rub -PRON- mittene hand together and thoroughly enjoy the situation some scamp be try to get ahead of griffyn and -PRON- say i crossly 
do -PRON- observe that the cold be abate inquire -PRON- companton 
the sleep bag do seem to be thaw out 
exactly 
and i be in a profuse perspiration 
prebble divest -PRON- of -PRON- mitten and parka then from somewhere about -PRON- person -PRON- produce -PRON- steelrimme spectaclesand adjust -PRON- to -PRON- nose 
ah -PRON- exclaim peer at -PRON- sharply 
-PRON- be a joy to use one glass and have -PRON- keep ciear of the frost 
do -PRON- realize what a rise thermometer mean captain say divest -PRON- mean warm weather -PRON- of a few of -PRON- fur 
also that -PRON- be sail southward at a greaf rate 
i be startle for i have not think of the rise temperature in that way 
-PRON- hope of reach the pole on that expedition be to be only a hope and nothing more 
the field be be leave clear for -PRON- rival griffyn the man who have follow -PRON- like shadow ever since leave the coast of labrador 
-PRON- bitterness of soul may be imagine but not describe 
in the gloom of the moment i forget -PRON- hunger forget thatthe professor and i werebalance on the iron horn of a dilemma that may easily prove -PRON- undoingforgot everything in fact but that i have weather that long arctic night and bear innumerable hardship all to nno purpose 
-PRON- enter the domain of the improbable come the remark of the professor break in upon -PRON- unpleasant reflection 
hard luck have a domain of -PRON- own say glare from -PRON- niche into and -PRON- so commonplace -PRON- canot call -PRON- improbable 
-PRON- do not grasp -PRON- meaning captain -PRON- companion proceed 
if -PRON- be to give any one in the temperate zone a true account of this adventure -PRON- statement would be dismiss with a shrugif with nothing bad 
-PRON- would have to back up -PRON- statement prebble 
-PRON- scientific standing would bolster up -PRON- integrity as a navigator and donot know about that 
i fall back aghast 
pick off the ice cap by a balloon and carry southward on the fluke of an anhor i have be meditate an indictiment against some reckless aronaut 
the term of that indictment be to set -PRON- right before those who have help finance -PRON- expedition 
what do -PRON- mean i rasp angrily know -PRON- have no sympathy with -PRON- poar aim and ambition but -PRON- canot deny the evidence of -PRON- sense 
captain -PRON- return be doubt the evidence of -PRON- sense 
north of the arctic circle the human faculty become frozen and unrelable 
i do not credit -PRON- present do not dare 
poppycock 
i cry inwrathful impatience -PRON- be under the spell of the purple snow -PRON- go on adventure seem very real to -PRON- because -PRON- hardship have create illusion 
all -PRON- life i have fight against be lead astray by illusionsand under the pole star lie the abode of thing that seem but be not mad as a hatter 
i storm 
not mad sali -PRON- protest mildly but temporarily unbalanced 
-PRON- be in the same state of mind 
i see -PRON- wriggle around in -PRON- half of the sleep bag punching and pinch -PRON- 
really -PRON- seem -PRON- have an idea that -PRON- be asleep and dream these very momentous event see -PRON- shake -PRON- head forebodingly upon be force to the conclusion that -PRON- be wide awake a scientific freak prebble i jeer be try in -PRON- feeble way -PRON- answer to combat error 
-PRON- be try to give reason the lie what -PRON- amount to 
when -PRON- brain be clear captain -PRON- will consider -PRON- action differently 
-PRON- be be snatch southward at a pace which should soon carry -PRON- out of these region of illusion i observe 
then if -PRON- be still in this sleep bag and balance across the fluke of the anchor i suppose -PRON- will have to believe what -PRON- see 
-PRON- make no response but i could see that -PRON- word have throw -PRON- into a brown study 
and i continue bitterly while -PRON- be bind for the prosy land of reality and truth -PRON- rival for polar honor be press forward into the white world of enchantment where -PRON- will probably discover what i have spend the well part of -PRON- life look for let that fact distress -PRON- captain say prebble 
griffyn may think -PRON- have find the pole and -PRON- may even get back to civilization to tell of itbut who will believe -PRON- 
these word although i know -PRON- to be farfetche and far from dependable give -PRON- a thrill of delight 
if -PRON- own statement and figure regard the discovery of the pole be not to be offer in evidence i take pleasure in see the report of -PRON- rival completely discredit 
the sentiment be unworthy i grant but i be human and have the customary human failing anyhow captain proceed prebble -PRON- have a contract with a newspaper a contract with a magazine and a contract with a lecture bureau 
out of these various contract -PRON- will be able to amass a fortune even if -PRON- find the pole 
griffyn even though -PRON- be successful will be discredit 
-PRON- be an exofficer of the army and the army will be behind -PRON- 
griffyn be only a poor devil who take a chance on reach the pole because -PRON- happne to find the way open 
nobody will believe griflyn 
if -PRON- claim only the farth north everybody will believe youin spite of the fact that -PRON- may not believe in -PRON- 
this be foolish talk prebble i declare 
-PRON- ought to be above such random conversation 
in -PRON- mind however i be already plan -PRON- newspaper and magazine article and be figure on the result of that lecture campaign 
there be a possibility that i should receive the thanksof congress and a medal 
-PRON- heart begin to thaw out even as the frost be melt away from the sleep bag 
-PRON- motion through space be easy and exhilarating 
-PRON- be like fly through the sky on downy bed of ease 
swinge through the air and cover the mile with magical swiftness be vastly different from trek with dog and sledge over the broken floe and make great detour to avoid open lead of water 
-PRON- be go southward and the result of -PRON- daring and -PRON- peril have be merely the attainment of the farth north 
although the fact be deplorable -PRON- have -PRON- amenity i give -PRON- over to a long period o contemplation 
in the course of -PRON- thought i find occasion to dwell at some length on the arrival of this mysterious balloon 
who be the aronaut and where have -PRON- come from 
quite naturally i could formulate no answer to these mental query 
hour pass then suddenly -PRON- companion reach over the partition and touch -PRON- shoulder 
the cloud be vanish -PRON- say out and look upward captain 
i obey 
high above -PRON- be the huge bulk of a balloon and visible over the rim of the wickerwork car suspend beneath be the face of two man whom i know only too well 
i be speechless for a moment 
then a cry of rage escape -PRON- 
sali by jupiter boom a voice from overhead 
griffyn 
i shout 
what an irony of fate 
-PRON- enemy and -PRON- secretary be the aronaut and -PRON- be theiranchor that have hook into -PRON- sleep bag 
prebble clasp -PRON- bony hand convulsively didnot know that griffyn have a balloon -PRON- mutter hoarsely 
for sake captain be amiable 
be silence 
i command 
-PRON- have take an underhand advantage of -PRON- captain sali -PRON- enemy call down 
-PRON- have attach -PRON- to -PRON- anchor sirrah with never so much as a by -PRON- leave 
-PRON- conduct be unprofessional and i shall make -PRON- know to the member of the arctic club 
if i have want to take -PRON- with -PRON- i should have invite -PRON- 
be a sailor i have a supply of language for just such an emergency as this 
before i could release the torrent of word however griffyn -PRON- last infamy be -PRON- saidhad reach -PRON- hand from the basket and have sever the drag rope with a keen knife 
down -PRON- drop through the depth of space down down the wind shriek in -PRON- ear and -PRON- brain reel 
then a shock a roar as of a hundred niagara and after thatoblivion 
where be -PRON- 
that be -PRON- first question 
-PRON- fall instinctively from -PRON- lip and be address to no one in particular 
i be a very much bewilder man 
as i recline on the ground and make use of -PRON- startled eye to -PRON- right i see a pond circular in form and perhaps fifty yard in diameter 
this pond be edge with block of white stone in the center of -PRON- stand a graven figure of colossal proportion a jet of water spout from -PRON- uplifted hand 
rosebush in full bloom border the lake and back of the rosebush separate by a stretch of white sand grow palm tree toss -PRON- fronde top in the balmy air 
bird sing in the depth of the grove and a genial heat pervade the atmosphere 
i rub -PRON- foreheadwater 
hye from the sleeve of -PRON- soaked coat as i raise -PRON- hand 
where be -PRON- 
i ask again this time in a loud key 
marvelous croon a familiar voice behind -PRON- be the balloon be -PRON- be the lake and the way -PRON- get out divide from a goes into i look around and there kneel that bless old professor wet as a rat trace algebraic symbol in the sand with -PRON- finger 
professor i call avast with -PRON- foolish ness and try to make a guess as to where -PRON- be 
-PRON- look up at -PRON- blankly 
water from -PRON- drench garment have rille around -PRON- in the sandy soil and be run down -PRON- arm and off the index finger that be trace the symbol 
still on -PRON- knee over the unsolved equation -PRON- allow -PRON- eye to wander from -PRON- toward -PRON- surrounding fountain -PRON- say 
really a most admirable work of art and -PRON- spout fresh water say freeingy -PRON- lung of a mouthful of -PRON- 
the lake -PRON- go on run -PRON- gaze oven the circular stone border show calculation and design carry out with engineering skill and a rare eye for beauty correct i agree 
rose in full bloom -PRON- proceed 
the air be redolent of odor that be soothe and delightful 
exactly i return 
-PRON- must have make a tremendous southing on the fluke of that anchor 
palm tree suggest the tropic 
suggest -PRON- answer grant -PRON- but -PRON- be a suggestion -PRON- must adopt warily 
the league upon league that lie between the arctic circle and the equator could not have be cover by -PRON- on the fluke of the anchor 
l know that say and i wish -PRON- would exercise -PRON- wit and make a guess at -PRON- present position bewilder 
one thing at a time captain -PRON- admonish bend over -PRON- problem be the balloon be -PRON- have become of the balloon i cut in searchmg the sky for some 5ign of the sky wanderer 
prebble frown and again look up 
bus -PRON- do not rise 
when -PRON- be cut away captain -PRON- explain the immense weight suddenly release from the balloon cause -PRON- to mount to extraordimary height 
this warm air too would have -PRON- effect on the gas in the bag expand -PRON- and give -PRON- tremendous buoyancy 
griffyn be sail on 
and southward i chuckle 
the scoundrel drop -PRON- by the way and i be glad -PRON- have part company 
in -PRON- rage -PRON- be at least leave -PRON- nearer the pole than -PRON- be -PRON- 
the professor frown thoughtfully 
griffyn must have come from the north captain -PRON- observe 
in order to pick -PRON- off the ice cap and bear -PRON- south griffyn must have come out of the north 
the professor logic paralyze -PRON- 
do -PRON- thinkis -PRON- possible -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mouth and i could carry the ditressing word no further 
do i think finish the professor that -PRON- have discover the pole and that -PRON- be come away from -PRON- when the anchor pick -PRON- up 
that be an open question an open question 
-PRON- need not concern -PRON- about -PRON- once more -PRON- begin -PRON- movement over the sand be the balloon be but i do concern -PRON- about -PRON- 
i shout 
if griffyn have find the pole i donot believe i can ever get over -PRON- 
prebble be annoy by -PRON- interruption and jab -PRON- finger angrily into the symbol b 
remember what i have already tell -PRON- sali -PRON- flare 
nobody will believe griyn find the pole even if -PRON- claim the honor 
-PRON- canot proveit 
-PRON- observation will be faulty anyhow would -PRON- be possible to take observation from a balloon travel as fast as that one 
the airship be the sport of the wind 
be -PRON- possible that the wind carry griffyn to the pole 
exercise reason sali 
then -PRON- admit that -PRON- reasoning be to be trust 
i inquire 
-PRON- be in a tropical clime 
the frozen ice field have be leave behind -PRON- 
the result of -PRON- calculation can not be nip by the 
rost 
i that be not the case why should i be qtraoglmo to work out a problem that have to do with -PRON- rescue from the lake 
amuse -PRON- sali and leave -PRON- to -PRON- labor 
professor say be in a land that be inhabit by people well advanced in the art and science 
what -PRON- see prove -PRON- 
instead of waste -PRON- energy try to work out a trifling problem would -PRON- not be well to stroll off somewhere and look for some one who can tell -PRON- what -PRON- want to know 
-PRON- be still annoy still fretful 
that equation have obsess -PRON- and -PRON- be not to be draw aw ay from -PRON- 
one thing at a time -PRON- answer 
let -PRON- meet -PRON- problem as -PRON- come to -PRON- 
-PRON- be sure of the present but -PRON- can not predicate certain of the future 
if -PRON- have business any place else sali donot let -PRON- detain -PRON- a moment 
-PRON- wave -PRON- hand to command silence 
in disgust i turn from -PRON- and search the distance with wonder eye 
fortune have be extremely kind to the professor and -PRON- there be no gainsaying that 
cut joose from the balloon by the murderous hand of griffyn -PRON- have from space 
apparently -PRON- line have fall in pleasant place 
i say apparently for presently something happen which prove -PRON- position be not so secure as i have imagine 
a sound reach -PRON- earsa sound as of a stealthy movement 
i whirl on the professor 
-PRON- have not leave -PRON- kneeling posture but be gabble to -PRON- and oblivious of everything but -PRON- foolish problem and behind -PRON- good heaven 
what i see behind the professor steal upon -PRON- with deadly intent be a figure such as i have never before encounter outside of a hideous nightmare 
seven foot the figure stand if -PRON- stand an inch -PRON- walk upright and bear a striking resemblance to man have two arm two leg a head and feature more or less human 
but -PRON- be cover from top to toe with a fine reddish hair the hair of the scalp long and flow mg about the shoulder save for a bearskin twist around -PRON- middle the monster be entirely nude 
how -PRON- eye snappgd and glow in the furry recess of -PRON- face 
and as -PRON- steal toward the professor with catlike tread -PRON- raise a long spear with a shimmering point poise the weapon 
i try to shout a warning but -PRON- tongue clove to the roof of -PRON- mough 
i try again and this time i manage to gurgle incoherently 
the professor peer in -PRON- direction 
i flutter a hand toward the impending danger and -PRON- turn around 
ha -PRON- gasp 
miss link 
speech return to -PRON- 
with -PRON- come the thought that unless i put the professor peril into term -PRON- could instantly comprehend -PRON- be lose be the miss link i cry b be the spear and be -PRON- 
a divide -PRON- from b go into and be what become of prebble 
-PRON- give a yell of horror and 
fall flat 
chug 
as -PRON- drop the spear flash through the air above -PRON- head and bury -PRON- point in the sand 
this danger have hurl -PRON- upon -PRON- with paralyze suddenness 
i have succeed in master -PRON- nerve however and be able to deal actively with the situation 
in a twinkling i spring for the spear jerk -PRON- from the ground and balance -PRON- in -PRON- hand as i face the hairy demon kill -PRON- captaindonot cry prebble excitedly 
really -PRON- s a most remarkable speciman and -PRON- must take -PRON- back with -PRON- 
the thing crouch in front of -PRON- eye burnmg like twin coal and muscle work with an itch to spring a gigantic gorilla 
i declare 
nonsense return prebble as much above the gorilla as -PRON- be below man 
-PRON- think be paoan god and be bent on test -PRON- mvulnerability 
careful what vou do captain 
-PRON- complete the darwinian chain darwinian fiddlestick i cut in out of patience 
calm -PRON- sir 
tortune favor -PRON- when -PRON- be cut loose from the balloon 
-PRON- fall into that lake and this creature must have pull -PRON- out 
if -PRON- have want to slay -PRON- why didnot -PRON- do so while -PRON- be unconscious and entirely at -PRON- mercy 
observe captain 
prebble get up and look the hairy monster in the eye hungry -PRON- say make motion with -PRON- hand and jaw as though eat famish 
what kind of a pagan god do -PRON- imagine -PRON- will think vou if -PRON- find -PRON- be hungry demand so say the professor 
-PRON- lucubration captain occasionally evolve something that be particularly apt 
just then the monster roar aloud 
the mighty sound go echo through the grove and be answer in kind from a dozen different point 
-PRON- be undo 
i groan as a whole pack of the fiend appear and race toward -PRON- in full cry from every quarter 
i be not blind to the incongruity of the situa tion 
although no judge of art i know full well that the colossus in the center of the lake be beyond the craft of these halfnake creature whose facial angle be small improvement on those of the orangutan 
grant that these man brute be subject of a ruling race where be the real lord of the country or some one in authority to whom -PRON- could make appeal 
prebble and i be face to face with death in a most horrible form 
the red demon be rush upon -PRON- snarl and yelping like so many bloodhound -PRON- spear level and ready to impale -PRON- 
-PRON- could not take to tree for the attack force be between -PRON- and the grove 
nor could -PRON- retreat for the lake lie behind -PRON- 
-PRON- doom be seal 
i feel -PRON- in every fiber yet i would not shame the glorious tradition ofthe american sailor by stand supinely and allow -PRON- to be spear 
the last ditch for -PRON- 
grip the haft of -PRON- sevenfoot lance i hold -PRON- at attention 
consider that the world be to lose an exhaustive paper on the meteoric theory of the aurora and a thesis on the miss link prebble carry -PRON- admirably 
thirty second of life captain say -PRON- -PRON- be get ready to thiow 
only one of -PRON- be to throw say look 
that hulkig imp with the ring in -PRON- ear be to have the first cast 
see -PRON- rise on one foot -PRON- throw -PRON- backhe let the spear y i watch every faculty whet to abnormal keenness 
the weapon dart toward -PRON- -PRON- bright point cleave the air like a jet of fire 
i strike at -PRON- wildly 
fate be kind and i counter the shaft swerve -PRON- sideways and send -PRON- hiss into the water of the lake 
the fatal moment be postpone that be all 
clench -PRON- tooth i wait for the next enemy to step to the front and make a trial 
captain quaver the professor clutch -PRON- arm convulsively have this forget about -PRON- a revolver 
prebble be hold -PRON- out to -PRON- in -PRON- shake hand 
a shout escape -PRON- lige down the spear i clutch the firearm and before a second savage could launch a shaft i have fire 
the effect of that shot be tremendous 
the bullet do not find a markmy nerve be not steady enough for accurate shootingbut the report be allsufficient of the uncanny creature fall face downward and lie groveling on the earth now prebble cry sharply run for -PRON- life 
the woodsthe wood 
-PRON- start and have almost gain the shelter of the tree when a second detachment of the enemy appear before -PRON- 
i present the revolver and pull the trigger but only an omi rnious click follow 
again and again i try but without success the cylinder be empty 
togmlfchaqua pura mix with the ammumtion say the professor sagely 
thar hath in the lake must have disable the firearm a wonder captain that -PRON- be able to fire even a single shot 
a very pretty problem suggest -PRON- and i 
look 
i cry interrupt -PRON- idle chattbr in a frenzy elevate -PRON- spear point be dead man in a dozen tick of the watch unless -PRON- can do something to save -PRON- be at the end of -PRON- resource declare the professor calmly 
but i be not 
an idea flash over -PRON- and i begin pufte -PRON- into execution without delziy 
with a hop skip and jump i start a grotesque dance hop up and down wave -PRON- arm and grimace as horribly as i know how 
the professor watch -PRON- in a sort of fascination 
i see wonder in -PRON- face and then dismay and something very like anguish 
but i also see the lift spear of the red rabble poise motionless in midair 
that be the result for which i be work and i redouble -PRON- exertion scream prebble be afraid of this 
i know -PRON- be unbalanced 
i know -PRON- mind be trend toward this deplorable condition but i have not expect such violence 
get busy prebble 
i pant pirouette on -PRON- toe and throw off a small cascade of water as i whirl 
-PRON- poor friend wail prebble clasp -PRON- hand and strike an attitude of extreme dejection 
go to -PRON- 
pffe show off a few buckandwing step a pair of dance dervish prebble 
reel -PRON- off manreel -PRON- off 
the spear still hang motionless in the air 
i have the hairy monster guess for -PRON- contoetion be make a powerful appeal to -PRON- aboriginal mind 
the professor hurry toward -PRON- and lay an implore hand on -PRON- arm 
if -PRON- must die captain sali -PRON- beg let -PRON- go decently and as become intelligent man be an idiot 
i fling back -PRON- see that do this for a purpose purpose the professor answer 
what purpose can such crazy antic serve resemble a coupie of pincushion by now prebble if i hadnot start this fandangd 
the word be fairly jolt ouit of -PRON- as i totter around first on one foot and then on the other see this trick work on the incian 
all barbarian particularly those who be low in the human scale have a sperstitious eration for person who be crazy 
the idea pop into -PRON- head and i begin to carry -PRON- out 
-PRON- see what an effect -PRON- be have 
-PRON- enemy have now drop -PRON- spear point and be gaze at -PRON- curiously 
-PRON- imagine remark the professor study the savage with a gooddeal of interest -PRON- be some sort of an evil deity donot care what -PRON- imagine say just so -PRON- keep -PRON- distance and donot use -PRON- spear 
how long do -PRON- think -PRON- can keep that up donot know i answer hope i can keep -PRON- up until somethingor other happen to insure -PRON- safety indenitely 
the professor be showig no disposition to join -PRON- in the dance 
-PRON- be only when the savage execute a movement en masse toward the right and lift -PRON- spear for a throw at -PRON- that -PRON- leap into terpsichorean effort 
-PRON- require no ufging from -PRON- 
-PRON- be quick to perceive the danger and equally quick toresont to the only mean for avert -PRON- 
round and round -PRON- whirl exemplify everything from a double shuffle to hornpipe and a highland fle 
this be monstrous wail the protessor step high 
what a performance for a man of -PRON- professional standing 
sali have never feel more humiliate in -PRON- life 
keep -PRON- up 
i beg of -PRON- hoarsely 
when -PRON- give out and have to drop feign a fit 
if -PRON- do -PRON- well -PRON- may save -PRON- 
at that moment when the spear be again lift the savage who have be routedpear the lake by the report of the revolver come war ily upon the scene 
by a wide detour -PRON- avoid -PRON- and join the one who be threaten -PRON- be something do now gasp hoarsely savage who just come will tell the other about the report of the revolver say prebble hopefully and that will so awe those who be hostile that -PRON- will be spare and allow to go in peace 
but the professor be wrong 
instead of the late comer inspire fear in -PRON- comrade by tell of the explode firearm the other side seem to get the good of the argument 
both party present a united front what be bad -PRON- exhibition of fancy dancing seerpe to have lose -PRON- charm 
the hostility wheeze the professor to have become general 
all hand be make ready to comc at -PRON- i whisper to be do sali 
can -PRON- run useless 
spear would lay -PRON- low before -PRON- have take a dozen leap toward the sky line may as well stop this foolish dancing 
yes and -PRON- both stagger to a stop like top that have all but run down 
i face the desperate situation with all the fortitude i could muster 
die like a man prebble i gasp all -PRON- can do now 
another moment and -PRON- should have fall pierce by half a dozen spear but the unexpected happen 
out from the shadow of the palm tree glide a form jn white halt between -PRON- and the threatening spear point and raise one hand commandingly 
instantly every spear point drop and the form in white turn slowly and survey -PRON- 
-PRON- protector be a woman 
-PRON- delicate feature the shelllike tint of -PRON- cheek -PRON- long sunny hair -PRON- graceful form all testify to that 
-PRON- be clothe in a cling robe of white edge with gold galloon buskin of white and gold cover -PRON- small foot and around -PRON- brow be a gold ribbon 
-PRON- wear no head cover and -PRON- wealth of yellow tress flow about hern like a veil even to -PRON- waist 
never have i behold such rare loveliness and twenty year of sea have not blunt -PRON- appreciation of the divine in woman 
an exclamation of astonishment and admiration fall from -PRON- lip 
nor be the astonishment all on -PRON- part 
surprise and wonder be mirror in the woman wide blue eye 
although thankful for -PRON- timely intervention i would have have -PRON- meeting with -PRON- occur unaer ippier auspex 
a young be but be particular how -PRON- come under the eye of beauty and -PRON- watersoaked clothe and disheveled appearance make -PRON- position most embarrassing 
prebble do not seem to mind -PRON- -PRON- be smirk and rub -PRON- hand and pushmg -PRON- forward in a way that irritate -PRON- 
thank -PRON- kindly say -PRON- bob -PRON- head and flash -PRON- bald pate in -PRON- eye the owner of these beautiful ground madam -PRON- language be not her 
-PRON- stare at the professor blankly and then shift -PRON- gaze to -PRON- 
-PRON- smile 
small wonder -PRON- smile with -PRON- learned companion ogling and duck and make a display of -PRON- hungry whimper the professor convey imaginary thing to -PRON- mouth and work -PRON- jaw famish -PRON- turn to -PRON- with an unwonted lusterin -PRON- eye 
-PRON- canot deceive -PRON- into thinking -PRON- be pagan god -PRON- impart 
this be paradise captain and -PRON- be one of the peri 
stop -PRON- tomfoolery say petulantly 
-PRON- spectacle be hang from one of -PRON- ear one of -PRON- mukluk be go and -PRON- look as though -PRON- have be through a cyclone laugh at -PRON- 
at -PRON- -PRON- titter 
both of -PRON- mukluk be go captain and i do not hear the rest 
look down i discover to -PRON- horror that -PRON- foot be bare and never before have -PRON- seem so large or so out of place 
i redden to the root of -PRON- hair 
a sailor and a gentleman may be excuse i trust 
-PRON- speak to -PRON- -PRON- voice like a flow rill ripple musical 
but -PRON- word 
-PRON- be as much beyond -PRON- as our be beyond -PRON- 
when -PRON- cease speak there be silence look perhaps what i could not say for -PRON- vouclisafe another smile turn to the hairy one behind -PRON- and address -PRON- imperiously 
-PRON- vanish then vanish whither -PRON- have come 
i gaze after -PRON- with eye that speak what -PRON- lip dare not utter if -PRON- could 
the fiend steal up to -PRON- fawningly make sign indicative of good will as well as suggest that -PRON- go with -PRON- 
-PRON- heed the mute request and be lead off through the grove in the direction take by the lady -PRON- lady of hope and deliverance 
behind -PRON- troop the other detachment of miss link equally harmless and equally desirous of show the amicable turn -PRON- feeling have take 
where be -PRON- professor 
i ask for the third time 
-PRON- have fall say -PRON- upon some uncharted isle in the tropic 
-PRON- be telemachus i be mentor the maid be circe 
beware captain 
folly 
do -PRON- mean to say that -PRON- be carry on the anchor of balloon from above the arctic circle to below the tropic of cancer 
how else do -PRON- account for the flower the palm the balmy atmosphere 
-PRON- be castaway captain and -PRON- line -PRON- seem have fall in pleasant place 
i marvel 
yet how else could -PRON- explain the surrounding in which -PRON- find -PRON- 
presently -PRON- come upon a vista which seem cut bodily from the thousand and one night 
a palace arise before -PRON- a palace with dome and tower of pure white outline against the blue sky 
a great flight of marble step lead upward to the facade of the building 
on either side of the first sfep stand two stalwart warrior on guard 
such a magnificent building murmur prebble 
there must be something to eat inside of -PRON- captain 
that be -PRON- hope say and the quicker -PRON- fall to the well be grow weak in the knee 
at the foot of the grand stairway a man appear as if by magic 
evidently -PRON- have be inform of -PRON- coming and be expect -PRON- 
ile be of normal height and wear a white tunie edge with silver 
-PRON- head be uncover and -PRON- forehead and short vellow hair be span with a silver ribbon -PRON- face be highbrowe and almost of grecian contour 
-PRON- eye be blue as be those of the young woman and as -PRON- rest on -PRON- a peculiar sensation speed along every nerve 
mentality be the keynote of the man eye 
the power of -PRON- mind be extraordinary and be reflect in -PRON- glance in a manner most strange and incomprehensible 
not be verse in psychology i could not explain this visual force 
i merely realize that the eye of this startling individual usurp the office of lip and tongue speak a language and compelling obedience 
without a spoken word the man turn on the hairy creature who have conduct -PRON- to the palace 
-PRON- quail under -PRON- look shiver and slink away 
then -PRON- flash an order to -PRON- 
the next moment -PRON- be ascend the step prebble and i at -PRON- heel 
whether -PRON- be the hypnotism of the man eye or a weakness cause by hunger ver -PRON- brain grow dizzy i stagger rather than walk and have but faint recollection of event for some time 
-PRON- be in a large room -PRON- seem and more of the uncouth slave be at work over -PRON- 
in duc course -PRON- leave this room and come out into another where there be strange plant and blossom and couch cover with fine skin -PRON- recline 
slave hover about -PRON- give -PRON- food out of silver dish what -PRON- eat i do not know but the food whatever -PRON- be be piquant and delicious 
with hunger finally appease i feel in a mood for sleep but the professor be gartulous -PRON- sizhe with blissful content settline -PRON- luxuriously upon -PRON- couch this be paradise this be the abode of the bl tor one be very much oblige to griffyn for cut -PRON- clear of -PRON- balloon 
-PRON- will answer for that 
i scowl allow a spasm of righteous wrath to cross -PRON- contentment 
will -PRON- so mv dear captain chuckle prebble 
where and when if i may ask 
where 
i snap 
why where else can i pillory -PRON- save in -PRON- own country which -PRON- unprofessional conduct have disgrace 
and when -PRON- ask 
as to that prebble i promise -PRON- -PRON- shall happen directly -PRON- return to civilization 
return to civilization have alreadyreturne to civilization captain 
ever since -PRON- drop from the balloon -PRON- have see all around -PRON- evidence of a most civilized and progressive people 
-PRON- quibble sald with strong dlsapproval -PRON- do not fit -PRON- character professor 
-PRON- understand what i mean 
-PRON- have here a very high grade of civilization -PRON- seem but what i have in mind be a return to -PRON- own country 
and when will that be -PRON- ask in the dark as to that presume however that -PRON- have only to describe -PRON- situation to the people in authority here in order to be assist to a home port 
-PRON- cackle 
there be something in that jaugh of -PRON- which always ruffle -PRON- nerve the wrong way 
what be there humorous about that 
i demand fancy -PRON- reply that -PRON- be build -PRON- hope on a very insecure foundation 
the ruler of this most delightful land may have other plan for -PRON- 
-PRON- may not lend -PRON- -PRON- assistance as -PRON- so fondly imagine 
certainly i return -PRON- must have compassion upon -PRON- 
people so artistic and so progressive must have heart to be touch by -PRON- forlorn situation 
-PRON- be a rich people and a rich and cultured people be always generous 
-PRON- may not be able to help -PRON- however 
why not 
prebble loved disputation for -PRON- own sake 
-PRON- be not always to be take seriously when -PRON- grow arguinentative be fairly well acquaint with the chart portion of the seven sea -PRON- go on and i have read extensively along the line of anthropology and kindre science but i find -PRON- impossible to identify those hairy monster who come so near prove -PRON- undoing or these whiterobe demigod who come to -PRON- rescue 
nor have i the least idea what country this be or where -PRON- can be situate 
if wvisite before -PRON- certainly must have be write about 
there be nothing in literature however that touch upon this favor country 
of that be positive 
do -PRON- incline to the belief that -PRON- make an abnormal southing while on the anchor of that balloon 
-PRON- doubt -PRON- when i mention the matter by the lake and then on -PRON- way to this palace -PRON- seem to swerve and incline to -PRON- original opinion 
but -PRON- own idea have undercrone a change 
-PRON- be physically impossible for -PRON- to be carry so far south say -PRON- after a little reflection 
-PRON- be in a tropic land tropic land under the arctic circle paradox i grant -PRON- 
yet -PRON- must helieve the evidence of -PRON- sense and predicate equatorial region here or else -PRON- must doubt the evidence altogether and fall back upon the assumption that -PRON- be non cou pos and be not to place any credence in what -PRON- see or feel or hear 
bah say l rather incline to the theory -PRON- proceed unmove by -PRON- disgusted retort -PRON- be under the spell of the purple snow 
-PRON- be very possible that -PRON- be btlll on the ice cap in the sleep bag far go with hunger and freeze slowly 
-PRON- mind be benumb save for a few of -PRON- faculty which appear to be abnormally alert 
this astounding theory quite take -PRON- breath 
noensense 
i exclaim as soon as i be able to express -PRON- suppose -PRON- have be immpale by that spear down by the lake 
that be not an imaginative spear prebble and -PRON- would not have die an mmaginative death 
to drop into the vernacular -PRON- smile -PRON- frozen finish would merely have be symbolize by that spear 
what -PRON- be apparently underit seem to -PRON- be merely symbolical and -PRON- think be asleep 
if -PRON- be -PRON- would be difficult to awake in a pleasanter paradise than this 
for one captain i be not particular whether -PRON- ever leave this abode of bliss or not 
how about -PRON- meteoric theory of the aurora -PRON- will be a distinct loss to science if that be never enunciate -PRON- answer with a dash of disappointment -PRON- brightenedif -PRON- fail to qualify with -PRON- newspaper and magazine and the lecture platform i believe i should be able to bear with -PRON- own disappoint ment -PRON- principal reason for return to -PRON- own country just now say i firmly be to enlighten the arctic club and the world regard griffyn 
forget griffyn captain 
-PRON- own safety seem to demand that -PRON- cut -PRON- adrift 
i be thankful that -PRON- release -PRON- from -PRON- balloon for otherwise -PRON- should not have visit this most lnterestlng country 
i have a sufciency of -PRON- view however and while -PRON- talk on i go to sleep 
i be awaken by a touch on the shoulder 
start up from the couch i encounter the yes of the man who have meet -PRON- at the palace step 
the eye bid -PRON- get up obeyed and catch a ghimpse of the professor in a tunic of white and silver with a silver ribbon snugly encircle -PRON- bald spot 
at this i laugh immoderately but cease when the face of -PRON- unknown friend turn on -PRON- in rebuke 
the face be grave ominous and i read disaster in -PRON- every line 
command by a look prebble and i trail after -PRON- guide to an archway hang with arra in cloth of gold 
the curtain be part by invisible hand and -PRON- pass through into an immense apartment -PRON- eye dazzle with a scene ofgorgeousness i shall never forget 
yellow and white and blood red be the prevail color of vaulted roof lofty wall and tessellate floor 
the gleam of gold be above -PRON- the sheen of silver on all side and -PRON- buskine foot trod tile of jasper 
in front of -PRON- at the farther end of the vast room be a throne with a crimson canopy 
un der the canopy sit a man clothe in the prevail white and silver and wear a crown that flash with jewel 
on the topmost step of the short flight lead to the dais sit a regal figure in white and gold 
i rub -PRON- bewilder eye for unless -PRON- deceive -PRON- this be -PRON- who have save -PRON- at the lake 
the room be throng with people in white and silver and white and gold and a lane have be open for -PRON- up to the very step of the throne 
ray of sun enter through window in the eastern wall strike the tile and throw wondrous patch of scarlet over the whiteclad group 
amid all this bewilder scene the mind of prebble be amalytically at work 
i could hear -PRON- mutter the woman wear the gold and the man wear the silver 
how do -PRON- come that an island so rich with inhabitant of such intellectual power have never be hear of by the outside ordp captain well breathe softly 
-PRON- still think be pagan deity 
-PRON- have be robe in the costume of the country and -PRON- with -PRON- black hair and dark eye look well enough although a trifle out of place stand there like a dazed imbecile 
throw dignity into -PRON- bearing 
watch -PRON- 
-PRON- adjust -PRON- spectacle fold -PRON- arm across -PRON- narrow chest and peer about -PRON- with lofty disdain 
but -PRON- be not of a size to foster an impression of haughtiness 
as -PRON- stand there cynosure for all eye two between -PRON- -PRON- carry -PRON- old sleep bag and lay -PRON- on the floor before the throne 
the man who have take -PRON- in hand advanced kowtow to -PRON- ruler and begin to talk 
-PRON- be word that come from -PRON- lip and that -PRON- have all to do with -PRON- be evident from the astounded look that continue to be turn in -PRON- direction 
when -PRON- have make an end -PRON- salaam and step back 
thereupon the young woman speak to the king from -PRON- seat on the tep 
-PRON- remark finish the king -PRON- indulge in a few word and the man who have bring -PRON- to the throne room give -PRON- attention to the sleep bag 
-PRON- clothe be inside the bag and be bring out and duly exhibit 
there be something else which -PRON- friend want and -PRON- get -PRON- by bury himsellfto the heel in the bag 
as i live -PRON- be a quaft flask of whisky 
look here prebble i growl in -PRON- ear do -PRON- have that flask all the while -PRON- be lose on the ice cap -PRON- mumble 
and -PRON- never say anything about -PRON- 
i exclaim fiercely 
i tell -PRON- be save -PRON- for emergency 
i be strongly tempt to lay hand on prebble but just then hand be lay on both of -PRON- and -PRON- be hurry up nearer the throne 
the king rap -PRON- scepter against the arm of the throne chair 
a little man appear a little man with luminous eye and the nose and chin of a punchinello 
in -PRON- hand -PRON- carry two metal circlet each cross with a pair of thin metal band bent into concave form 
-PRON- seem to understand what be wanie of -PRON- for after salute the king -PRON- come to prebble and -PRON- and place the contrivance upon -PRON- head 
-PRON- fit the skull like a cap i trust that so far -PRON- have not be necessary for an officer and a gentleman to dwell upon -PRON- veracity 
that i advert to -PRON- here be simply because i have reach a point where the reader credulity may receive -PRON- first shock 
other shock will follow and i wish to lighten the blow by a manly and straightforward statement 
prebble and i have drop in on a truly wonderful people 
the skill -PRON- show the art -PRON- apply the highly develop mental process that be -PRON- be the natural concomitant of a civilization mark at every turn by way and mean to -PRON- oftentime inexplicable i be write these experience with painstaking care and if the reader will abide with -PRON- to the end i promisethat -PRON- shall not only be instruct and thrill but convince as well wa then for the first shock 
the instant those metal cap be place upon -PRON- head prebble and i be put en rapport with these amazing being 
-PRON- could not only understand -PRON- speech but -PRON- tongue be endow with -PRON- 
stranger wherice come -PRON- demand the king 
prebble clap -PRON- hand like a delighted schoolboy pull off -PRON- metal cap look at -PRON- gloatingly fondle -PRON- and then replace -PRON- upon -PRON- shine pate 
from a far country sir lic answer 
what bring vou hither chance 
and a drag rope i add mentally 
be -PRON- from beyond the ice wall 
prebble blink in bewilderment do not understand -PRON- majesty say -PRON- 
for once i happen to be a little quick of comprehension 
what be the latitude of this country sir i askud eagerly 
the king nod toward the little man with the hooked nose and chin degree and forty minute north say the little man 
twenty minute i gasp reel against prebble 
twenty minute from the pole falter prebble 
what do this all mean 
only twentythree mile from the goal of -PRON- hope shout only twentvthree mile from fame from the great discovery tie world have ever know 
glory 
i dance around like a wild man mile 
i roar 
tnile 
i start at a run for the doorway anxious to leave the palace and race on foot over the twentythree mile that separate -PRON- from the spot -PRON- be -PRON- consume desire to reach 
prebble grab -PRON- but i keep on jerk -PRON- heel over head 
the two hairy warrior then place -PRON- in -PRON- way and i fight like a fiend to escape 
there be the great disorder in the vast room 
the king be on -PRON- foot and the court be in a tumult be fiercely -PRON- sense dazzle by -PRON- proximity to the pole 
have i use -PRON- reason i may have question the reliable nature of the knowledge just give -PRON- for how could i be in a tropical region and yet only twentythree mile from the goal of myl ambition 
but i be in no condition just then to reason about anything 
i be wild with excitement 
food and rest have revive -PRON- failing strength a straightcut blow from the shoulder daze one of the hairy guard -PRON- only daze -PRON- however 
have -PRON- be endow with ordinary physical power -PRON- would have floor -PRON- 
the fellow come back at -PRON- hiss like a wild eat 
i see -PRON- ponderous hand clench for a retaliate blow and -PRON- gigantic arm draw back 
a shout from the king cause the second of the two guard to seize -PRON- companion arm before -PRON- could strike 
this diversion seem to leave the path clear for -PRON- and i turn to continue mry mad flight 
a foot trip -PRON- and i measure -PRON- length on the jasper tile 
before i could rise two bare knee be on -PRON- chest pin -PRON- down and two hand be at -PRON- wrist hold -PRON- powerless 
prebble white and apprehensive draw close 
captain say -PRON- -PRON- be beside -PRON- 
what folly 
man man donot -PRON- know -PRON- be impossible to escape from this palace guard as -PRON- be 
even if -PRON- do manage to get outside in traverse the twentythree mile say to lie between -PRON- and the pole there wculd be ample opportunity to lay -PRON- by the heel 
the whole country would be up in arm against -PRON- 
i cease struggle 
that be quite true professor answer 
-PRON- enthusiasm run away with -PRON- 
-PRON- enthusiasm come very near cost -PRON- -PRON- life 
but the pole there be some wild guessing on the part of the gentleman with the hooked nose 
reason tell -PRON- that the polar region be choke with ice 
there could be no summer weather such a short distance from the north pole 
either that captain or -PRON- be in a realm of enchantment donot believe in enchantment i scoff enough of this 
get off -PRON- say to the giant on -PRON- chest and be tractable 
the guard do not seem to comprehend 
prebble pick up the helmet which i have drop from -PRON- brow and replace -PRON- 
now tell -PRON- say -PRON- 
by the aid of that marvelous ring hell be able to understand -PRON- 
some of the noble have advance by that time and the hostile flash of -PRON- blue compelling eye force the warrior to arise and allow -PRON- to regain a more dlgme attitude 
i arrange -PRON- disordered tunic 
the sallen guard place -PRON- one on cach side of -PRON- and one of the noble step close and speak sharply 
this say -PRON- most unseemly conduct for the throne room be carry away by the knowledge that be impart to -PRON- i return humbly be very sorry i cause any trouble 
-PRON- be very impulsive put in prebble altogether too much so at time for -PRON- own good 
but at least assure -PRON- bar a few little conceit and crochet -PRON- be a very agreeable fellow 
-PRON- majesty deal very severely with any infraction of court etiquette go on the noblc unless -PRON- promise to be more circumspect in -PRON- behavior -PRON- will be necessary to put -PRON- in restraint do that vour lordship speak up prebble in considerable agitation captainmean well i assure -PRON- although now and then -PRON- have a poor way of show -PRON- 
i will stand sponsor for -PRON- 
the flinty blue eye of the noble wither the professor for a space 
and who will be responsible for -PRON- -PRON- ask 
prebble be usually sufficient unto -PRON- and -PRON- be humorous to see -PRON- squirm and shrivel under the flash of the noble blue orb 
in -PRON- own country answer the professor attempt a little dignity but with scant success -PRON- word be as good as -PRON- bond 
prebble be measure with a swift glance and the noble turn away with a shadow of a smile be -PRON- laugh at -PRON- the professor whisper in -PRON- ear do -PRON- mean by that 
-PRON- ring crook say completely restore to -PRON- normal condition of mind and -PRON- doesnot enhance the dignity of -PRON- appearamnpe 
better straighten -PRON- prebble afraid this outburst of yours capfan remark prebble as -PRON- straighten the ring will inspire the king to harsh measure against -PRON- donot think much of -PRON- as a king if -PRON- allow -PRON- judgment to be sway by a little natural exuberance on -PRON- part 
-PRON- should have repress -PRON- 
the fellow in the skin robe be still blink from the effect of that blow -PRON- deal -PRON- 
but for a remarkably thick skull i return not now be able even to blink 
the disorder have die away and a measure of courtly quiet once more prevailed 
the king have seat -PRON- and -PRON- guard obey an imperial gesture return prebble and -PRON- to the foot of the throne 
for age say -PRON- majesty -PRON- mythology have teach usto look for two fiend who wcre to drop from the sky and bring woe and ruin to -PRON- devoted kingdom 
be -PRON- those arch fiend 
answer 
by this time i have recover -PRON- wit 
no sir reply -PRON- be not the fiend -PRON- be expect 
-PRON- be come through the air on a strange ship and seem to be a little behind schedule but i assure -PRON- -PRON- will arrive all right 
prebble whirl on -PRON- catch one of -PRON- hand and shake -PRON- heartily neatly do captain -PRON- whisper must beat griffyn to the pole i return excitedly 
if -PRON- come down anywhere this side of latitude ninety i think that will block -PRON- 
-PRON- will be on the lockout fiend -PRON- mention pursue -PRON- meanwhile as there seem to be no httle mystery surroundmg -PRON- two gentleman i shall be under the pamful necessity of have -PRON- put to death 
sire cry the young woman look up at the king and hold out -PRON- hard appalingly 
-PRON- start to enter a vigorous protest but the king wave -PRON- hand impatiently 
princess ylma enough say -PRON- to the young woman sternly to -PRON- -PRON- add be deaf to -PRON- entreaty -PRON- have come as tradition say the demon be to come -PRON- act stranely and an ounce of prevention in this particular case be worth a pound of cure 
the professor and i gaze at each other in wildest horror 
for a space prebble dppeare to shrivel up then suddenly -PRON- expand a forlorn hope flicker across -PRON- pallid face 
spring to the heap of garment lie on the sleep bag -PRON- pick up the flask and carry -PRON- to the edge of the dais 
-PRON- be very great prophet in -PRON- own land king -PRON- aver glibly 
behold the proof of -PRON- skill and -PRON- wave the bottle aloft 
what be -PRON- ask the king 
the elixir of life sire 
drink and -PRON- will renew -PRON- youth 
eagerly the king grasp at the flask 
unwittingly prebble have touch a button that connect with -PRON- majestys dear desire 
beware -PRON- majesty cry voice 
itmay be poison already the king have unscrew the top 
after hesitate a moment -PRON- smile craftily 
drink say -PRON- hand the flask to the professor 
if -PRON- kill -PRON- 
i will let -PRON- alone 
prebble take a swallow from the flask 
then i grab -PRON- away from -PRON- and take another 
this satisfy the king 
take the flask from -PRON- hand -PRON- raise -PRON- to -PRON- lip and drank deeply 
-PRON- be lose 
as the fiery liquor go down an electric thrill send the hot blood race through -PRON- vein and -PRON- feel that the beginning of -PRON- rejuvenation be at hand 
these be not the fiend who be to bring destruction to -PRON- kingdom -PRON- cry 
these be -PRON- good friend 
lord nyli -PRON- be in -PRON- chargetheir safety be upon -PRON- head 
lodge -PRON- royally give -PRON- the good of everything 
gadzook but i feel a different man already 
away with -PRON- lord nylis 
and as for the rest of -PRON- depart from the presence 
i would fain be alone with -PRON- elixir 
again be there confusion 
during the hubbub prebble and i be conduct from the throne room and from the palace by lord nyli 
the flask of bourbon have save -PRON- for the time be but at what a cost of danger to -PRON- and vicissitude to that devoted kingdom forty eightynine forty i keep repeat to -PRON- as the professor and i follow lord nylis down the grand stairway of the palace could think of nothing but that the culmination of -PRON- earthly desire lie only twentythree mile away 
this lord nyhs be the astute person who have engineer -PRON- entrance into the palace 
at the foot of the marble step -PRON- pause and look toward the red warrior on the right 
instantly the warrior spear ring thrice against -PRON- shield 
that call -PRON- oyd car explain -PRON- lordship 
-PRON- be some distance from -PRON- palace and must ride 
the metallic crash of spear on shield have bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
at -PRON- lordship mention of a conveyance an idea flash through -PRON- mind 
could -PRON- not ride to the pole 
i ask eagerly 
-PRON- be not far lord nylis and i particularly desire to reach the pole 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- would be as much as -PRON- life be worth -PRON- answer 
a cold chill strike to -PRON- heart 
what do -PRON- mean 
i falter 
the pole be in the land of the chur -PRON- go on 
-PRON- be brute like these -PRON- indicate the guard to right and leave of the palace step but -PRON- be not under -PRON- domination of the chur -PRON- have bring to submission b will power alone and -PRON- be everywhere throughout the kingdom serve as soidieysand menial 
the chur at the pole however be wild and ferocious 
-PRON- never encroach upon -PRON- territory unless in quest of slave 
ah here be the oyd car 
mount genemgn 
the vehicle now draw up before -PRON- be a queer bit of mechanism 
the bed of -PRON- be dia tondshape and have a large wheel 
at each side and small one at the point front and rear 
aeros the middle be throw a very wide seat and there be another narrow one occupy by a shaggy chur in the front point 
home klimon say lord nyl 
klimon bend over asquare box and slightly raise a cover at the same time manipulate a lever on -PRON- left 
at once -PRON- glide and noiselessly run point foremost what furnish the motive power the professor be first with a question on this head be the powr that drive this vehicle -PRON- lordship 
-PRON- call -PRON- oyd answer the noble 
-PRON- drive all the machinery in the kingdom 
oyd mutter the professor know about everything worth know but somehow that have -PRON- 
will -PRON- explain 
the force be magnetic be the answer 
there be a mineral which -PRON- delve from deep in the ground and call zellin 
the whirl of the earth create a friction which make of the north pole a tremendously powerful loadstone so that -PRON- attract every particle of zellin on the surface of the kingdomand -PRON- attract only zellin and nothing else see say the professor sagely 
-PRON- have a piece of zellin in that box on the forward point of the carriage 
yes 
that box be a nonmagnetic screen and when -PRON- cover the cube of zellin the oyd power be shut off 
but the instant the front of the screen be raise the attract force set in and -PRON- move 
most remarkable cry prebble 
the amount of power be regulate by lift the front of the screenr exactly 
if the front be raise onethird the oyd force or attraction be only onethird but raise onehalf the attraction be onehalf the power of the zellin cube and so on 
hence -PRON- proceed at a slow pace at a run or with the full power of the cube -PRON- all but fly 
prebble strike -PRON- hand together in ecstasy 
how large be the cube -PRON- lordship -PRON- ask 
this car be fit with a twelveinch block which be a power 
a sixinch cube would be a twelveman power a tenty fourinch cube would be a power and so on 
be the force of the polar attraction always the same 
always 
and always attract due north the attraction be continually toward the pole 
how be -PRON- able to proceed in anything but a straight line lever on left conneet with the wheel at the rear point 
the turning of that wheel act as a rudder and steer -PRON- easterly or westerly 
beautiful beautiful 
but if -PRON- wish to go south directly away from the pole 
-PRON- rudder couldnot help -PRON- to move in that direction 
certainly not 
when -PRON- wish to go southward -PRON- make use of the suboyd power 
what be that pray 
do -PRON- not know that there be another magnetic pole 
the other be simply a focus of magnetic power and be the one that attract the needle of the mariner compass ah yes murmur prebble 
that pole be locate in seventyone north and ninetysix west 
-PRON- be the source of -PRON- suboyd power resume -PRON- lordship 
there be another screened box under foot inclose a cube of soft iron 
if -PRON- wish to travel due south or in any direction east or west by south the cube of zellin be scr eene entlrely and the cube of iron be switch forward on a movable arm 
the ratio of power in the suboyd cube be the same as in the oyd bldck how beautifully nature have care for -PRON- in this delightful country chirrup the professor 
beyond the ice wall -PRON- know nothmg of the oyd or suboyd power 
the force that attract -PRON- cube of soft iron be barely sufficient to sway -PRON- magnetlc needle 
how do -PRON- explain the difference in the power of -PRON- country and ours donot explain -PRON- say lord nylis 
-PRON- be one of inscrutable law 
-PRON- be travel swiftly over awellpave road 
the breath of june be in the air green grove and flowerstrewn meadow stretch on both side of -PRON- and as -PRON- journey i catch glimpse of strangelooke house half hide by the tree 
the people -PRON- pass or who come down to the roadway to look at -PRON- be all of a kind with the man and woman -PRON- have already see albeit of low station 
but i see none of -PRON- at work 
the country blossom as the rise yet no yellowhaired laborer be in the field 
i ask lord nylis about this 
-PRON- labor with the mind not with the hand -PRON- reply 
what the oyd and suboyd force can not accomplish the chur take care of 
-PRON- brain be overwhelm with all this riot of new sensation and unheurdof condition and i have be drop into a country as different from -PRON- own as -PRON- mind could conceive 
there be a thousand and one question want to ask but -PRON- very multitude appal and silence -PRON- 
i think of the pole and in spite of the savage chur i determine to reach -PRON- just as soon as i have familiarize -PRON- somewhat with the way of the country and could plan intelligently 
certainly if i could not get to the pole griffyn would not be able to do so 
from the pole -PRON- thought wndgre to the princess yima 
-PRON- lovely face be before -PRON- the rich cadence of -PRON- voice in -PRON- ear 
ah if fortune would be kind to -PRON- 
tl could win -PRON- and carry -PRON- back to -PRON- own country and -PRON- own come to -PRON- with a guilty start 
what crazy notion have take possession of -PRON- thag i should raise -PRON- eye to a princess of the blood 
i try to banish -PRON- from -PRON- thought but -PRON- entrance feature and dulcet voice would nof allow -PRON- to be ignore 
i recall the smile -PRON- give -PRON- and then i recall -PRON- miss mukluk and turn toward -PRON- two companion 
prebble be just ask for a test of speedhe want to see how fast the oyd car could run 
full power klimon 
say lord nylis 
the chur open the screen to -PRON- full extent and the carriage leap away like a bullet from a gun clung to the professor and the professor clung to -PRON- 
house people tree pass so swiftly that -PRON- dance on the sight in blur line 
finally -PRON- slow down by degree and come to a halt in front of -PRON- lordship palace 
thank heaven 
i exclaim 
hurrah for the oyd power cry the professor beside -PRON- 
the most wonderful power on earth -PRON- be the making of the kingdom remark lord nylis as -PRON- descend 
follow -PRON- gentleman this palace as be fitting be much small and less ornate than the one -PRON- have just quit 
still -PRON- be a gem in -PRON- way 
on a terrace amid flower and shrubbery and splashing fountain -PRON- recline at length on couch spread with downy robe of fur 
the heat be such that the shade of the terrace be most refreshing 
if i have have a cigar or a pipe i would have be in a seventh heaven 
lord nyli have make -PRON- as comfortable as -PRON- could in the circumstance excuse -PRON- for a space 
prebble peer at -PRON- as one in a daze 
-PRON- start to speak then check -PRON- as though -PRON- dare not trust -PRON- wonder to word 
out with -PRON- professor say i languidly 
what problem be bother -PRON- just now one problem captain but ahundre problem sigh prebble all atsea over this astounding adventure 
frozen fancy 
i laugh dream itall still on the ice cap in the sleep bag hope not i hope not -PRON- mumble 
all these experience with thing new and before untried be too interesting to be pase with any explanation of that sort 
of all the remarkable object -PRON- have so far behold -PRON- remove the glitter circlet from -PRON- browseasily carry off the palm 
i wonder norw and -PRON- frown as -PRON- wit begin work if -PRON- think in an alien language as well as talk in -PRON- 
do this ring exercise a power over -PRON- intellect to such an unheardof degree be too pleasant an hour to be disturb with riddle past -PRON- solving i break in 
suppose -PRON- consider a mistake -PRON- have madea mistake into which i be lead by -PRON- 
-PRON- lift -PRON- brow 
what mistake -PRON- inquire 
when the anchor pick -PRON- oft the ice cap i explain -PRON- assert that -PRON- be carry -PRON- south and that the balloon be come out of the north 
that seem a proper inference captain before -PRON- be inform of -PRON- proximity to the pole while in the throne room 
even at this moment be incline to take the information impart by that hooknose gentleman with a grain of salt 
however in a country of so many wonder perhaps -PRON- be not well to doubt anything 
if griffyn have come irom the north i go on there be another proper inference that -PRON- have come from the pole perhaps have discover -PRON- 
prebble replace the ring and nod to signify that -PRON- be follow -PRON- 
-PRON- have now proofk i continue that griffyn be go north when -PRON- snatch -PRON- off the ice cap -PRON- both tacitly realize and acknowledge that error in -PRON- audience with the king say the professor 
-PRON- chuckle 
the ruler of this delightful country tell -PRON- that two fiend be to drop out of the sky and bring trouble 
-PRON- very brilliantly inform -PRON- majesty that the fiend be none other than griffyn and -PRON- companion in the balloon 
admirable 
that be indeed a happy inspiration if griffyn and -PRON- friend will only come down and let -PRON- be discover i fancy the king will have confidence in -PRON- assertion 
that captain will mean continued safety for -PRON- 
but i return suppose the balloon come down among the chur 
that take -PRON- would prove a coup de grdce for the englishman hope -PRON- wonot happen say be -PRON- relent toward griffyn query prebble somewhat surprised canot find -PRON- in -PRON- heart i answer to wish -PRON- ill to that extent 
think of the spear which -PRON- so narrowly escape and i shudder have a welldefine impression observe prebble after a little reflection that -PRON- shall presently be put to -PRON- to look after -PRON- so -PRON- may just as well cease worry about the fate that be to overtake griffyn 
aye be -PRON- answer -PRON- have buy -PRON- life at the price of a flask of bourbon 
no good can come of such a transaction and i feel moody and apprehensive have be expect applause from -PRON- on the score of that flask of bourbon say prebble a little hurt 
-PRON- turn a point concern griffyn and -PRON- fellow voyager be the expect fiend and i shake hand with -PRON- anderwell gloat 
now -PRON- rebuke -PRON- ifor turn a point with the whisky 
not at all i hasten to answer 
-PRON- save -PRON- life and i appreciate -PRON- resourcefulness even though i overlook the selfish manner in which -PRON- stow away thatflask while -PRON- be on the ice cap 
a flask and a revolver 
i know nothing about these -PRON- friend 
each have do -PRON- part in preserve -PRON- captain 
the end therefore have justify the meaun 
let -PRON- pass 
the oyd and suboyd power be much in -PRON- mind here -PRON- have subtle force fully control and make to perform the will of man 
the people of this land have invent -PRON- selve into that blissfulstate where labor be unnecessary 
by sheer force of the intellect -PRON- conquer and hold in subjection the chur and make the hairy savage do menial service 
the life of the ruling race seem to be a life of enjoyment 
which be not and can never be a successful life i declare 
the dignity of labor be need to round out the life of this rule race 
if this situation have continue for any length of time then something be due to happen 
captain agree prebble -PRON- be probably correct 
but after -PRON- wear struggle with the ice a period of idleness afford a most refreshing prospect 
i nod 
but say prebble grow disputatious although the ruler of this land do not work with -PRON- hand let -PRON- not suppose that -PRON- be idle 
-PRON- mind must be busy 
and such mind 
the mental effort necessary to keep the enslave chur under subjection must be enormous 
at that moment lord nyli return and seat -PRON- on a couch beside -PRON- 
what be the name of this country -PRON- lordship i ask 
-PRON- call -PRON- nyll -PRON- answer 
and what be the name of the reign house 
boazar 
boazar be now on the throne 
have -PRON- many child 
i be slowly work up to the subject that be become as dear to -PRON- heart as the discovery of the pole 
one only the princess ylma 
-PRON- lordship voice sadden as -PRON- add with a gloomy shake of the head poor princess ylma 
i rouse to inquire why the princess yima should be the object of -PRON- commiseration when prebble break in ahead of -PRON- with a question on an altogether different matter 
whence come this heat lord nylis 
-PRON- have the sun here for six at a time but -PRON- do no furnish sufficient caloric fora climate like this 
the friction of the earth in -PRON- rotation around the pole generate the heat -PRON- lordship explain 
but the pole be figurative demur the professor 
the earth can cause no friction in turn around a figurative axis 
the axis be not figurative 
the pole i5 a real one 
of course -PRON- be say what do -PRON- think look for prebble 
-PRON- turn -PRON- head and blink at -PRON- through -PRON- glass learn thing captain sali say -PRON- that no two man outside of nyll ever learn before 
-PRON- press one hand to -PRON- temple 
merciful power -PRON- head be split 
this be morning isnot -PRON- lord nylis yes reply -PRON- lordship the morning of the long day 
when do -PRON- dine inquire prebble moisten -PRON- lip with -PRON- tongue and think no doubt of the good thing -PRON- have have at the palace of king boazar 
in two week and three day say lord nylis 
i be startle 
prebble nearly fall off -PRON- couch 
-PRON- lordship notice -PRON- astonishment and add -PRON- eat but three time daily -PRON- custom in -PRON- own country i comment 
but -PRON- day be six month long 
i groan 
and -PRON- eat only once in two month ask 
three month intervene between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper 
-PRON- sleep throughout the long nmight not a canot hibernate say preb ble rear up on -PRON- elbow and look at -PRON- 
captain let go home 
although -PRON- frame be meager and show no result of high living i yet know that prebble be fond of -PRON- meal and something of an epicure 
home 
i exclaim invent the fly machine professor and navigate -PRON- -PRON- do donot talk about home waste -PRON- time 
there there -PRON- friend put in lord nyli smilingly -PRON- shall not expect -PRON- to abide by -PRON- custom in this respect 
eat when -PRON- feel like -PRON- sleep when -PRON- wish 
-PRON- shall have the run of the larder and untrammeled use of the dormitory 
the king order gentleman humble roof be yours 
many thank -PRON- lordship say prebble -PRON- again be a man of science but -PRON- stomach be -PRON- weak point believe that even by the way what do -PRON- drink in this glorious land water 
nothing but water -PRON- have nothing else find water sufficient now i a glass ofof prebble be forget -PRON- 
have there be any alcoholic beverage in the kingdom that flask of bourbon would have be no novelty to the king 
a glitter come into the eye of -PRON- host and -PRON- rest a keen glance on -PRON- friend suppose say -PRON- that -PRON- elixir of life be the common beverage in the land from which -PRON- come prebble coughed 
tt be not so plentiftil as to be what -PRON- may call common lord nyli say -PRON- 
not -PRON- go on hastily that there be a scarcity of -PRON- 
on the contrary -PRON- be to be find nearly everywhere but -PRON- be for the select few who be able -PRON- quibble be carry -PRON- into deep place 
-PRON- be a subject moreover which make -PRON- uneasy 
i attempt to shift the topic should like to know something more about this princess ylma lord nyli i remark with assumed carelessness 
-PRON- affect not to hear -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- go on study the professor attentively must surely be of the select few who be able to obtain the elixir 
why yes reply prebble 
as need manifest -PRON- i have have -PRON- share of the potent fluid 
i be a scientist however and know where to draw the line 
now -PRON- go on with abrupt eagerness about this oyd force -PRON- be clearly as distrustful of the matter lord nyli be press as i be also -PRON- be seek to give another turn to the conversation 
-PRON- lordship however be not to be shake 
-PRON- cling to the subject relentlessly 
as i covertly watch the eye of -PRON- host an uncanny conviction that -PRON- be probe deep than -PRON- tongue lay hold of -PRON- 
what unplumbe depth lie at the back of -PRON- lordship penetrate glance 
-PRON- inform the king lord nyli interrupt prebble to remark that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be very great prophet in -PRON- own land 
the professor make a heroic effort to at ease and to meet the issue plausibly 
exactly so -PRON- return 
-PRON- own prophetic line be scientific 
the captain on the other hand be explore 
whenever -PRON- go explore -PRON- take -PRON- along to furnish fact and figure to work out various problem to the elixir -PRON- claim be a ptoof of -PRON- skill 
i wish in -PRON- soul that something may happen to draw -PRON- lordship off 
-PRON- be payingl out more than enough rope to entangle prebble and to trip -PRON- the less that elixir be discuss the well -PRON- would be for -PRON- 
quite true assert prebble with a panicky look in -PRON- direction 
then score lord nylis if -PRON- be a prophet if the elixir be a product of -PRON- skill and -PRON- know -PRON- virtue and make use of -PRON- why have -PRON- not renew -PRON- own youth 
prebble be silent 
-PRON- show -PRON- good sense by not plunge into some farfetched explanation that would give -PRON- lordship a chance to score again 
and lord nyli turn to meis youth not a condition in much demand in -PRON- own country 
be grow old so agreeable to those who live in -PRON- native land 
the professor answer for -PRON- 
perhaps -PRON- be even more afraid to trust -PRON- than -PRON- be to trust -PRON- 
gray hair command respect say -PRON- and that be what -PRON- prophet demand more than youththe respect bear of gray hair and wisdom 
this remark appear to please lord nylis 
the professor have touch -PRON- intellectual side where -PRON- be strong 
-PRON- seem then say -PRON- that -PRON- countryman particularly -PRON- prophet reverence knowledge far more than -PRON- desire youth 
that be the case -PRON- lordship 
then why do -PRON- give such a proof of -PRON- skill to -PRON- people 
if -PRON- be wise to grow old in year and wisdom even though -PRON- must die for -PRON- why cater to folly with a beverage which keep people young all man do not think the same on a subject so broad as that cough the professor no doubt wish -PRON- have leave -PRON- lordship to talk with -PRON- -PRON- elixir have a most remarkable effect upon the king be assure of that before i give -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- royal will be completely overturn 
the elixir be warrant to overturn the will of any one royal or otherwise 
a troubled look as i think cross -PRON- lordship countenance 
-PRON- must be exceedingly powerful -PRON- exclaim hesitate to describe the elixir full power to -PRON- lord nyli 
possibfy -PRON- would not believe -PRON- 
i be glad the professor hesitate 
the princess ylma i venture save -PRON- from the chur 
naturally -PRON- lordship i should be glad to learn something about the young lady 
the professor and i be deeply indebted to -PRON- and pardon -PRON- lord nyli interrupt but the marvelous power of -PRON- elixir have quite captivate -PRON- fancy 
and yet -PRON- frown a little as -PRON- speak have a premonition that -PRON- be not well for the people of this kingdom to renew -PRON- youth by mean of -PRON- elixir 
i feel -PRON- friend that i must go deeper into this subject 
-PRON- be new and at this juncture there be an interruption 
i draw a deep breath of satisfaction although certainly i should not have feel such profound relief have i know at the moment all that the interruption portend 
suddenly there come to -PRON- ear a loud shout from the direction of the road 
-PRON- spring up in time to see a large oyd car with a dozen armed chur and one nyllite sweep up to the palace step 
the instant the car stop the warrior and the man in charge of -PRON- leap to the ground and rush up to the terrace 
in another instant prebble and i be surround 
seize -PRON- command the nyllite who be captain of the king guard 
six spear point prick -PRON- breast and six pair of ferocious bloodshot eye glare into -PRON- the professor be also at bay in a precisely similar manner 
count zylox what mean this demand the indignant lord nyli confront the captain of the guard 
the king be die cry the count excitedly 
die echo -PRON- lordship aghast 
aye and through the madchination of these foreign devil 
woe woe to this land lord nylis 
at this very instant king boazar be stretch out on the dais at the foot of the throne chair roll -PRON- eye gasp and chokingly endeavor to give -PRON- final order 
what do -PRON- say query -PRON- hortified lordship 
-PRON- can not understand -PRON- pitiful attempt at speech resfonde the tearful captain of the guard 
whash mazzer -PRON- sound like mazzer whash mazzer over and over agam ah this be a sorry day for -PRON- beloved country 
-PRON- good king 
the last of the boazar 
-PRON- whirl furiously upon the chur who be thxeatemng prebble and -PRON- 
bind the foreign devil -PRON- shriek 
-PRON- life shall pay for this and a poor enough forfeit -PRON- be 
out of the fry pan into the fire be a homely expression but -PRON- describe a situation which seem to fit -PRON- case 
the king be in no danger but have use -PRON- elixir too freely 
yet how to convince count zylox of this before -PRON- be draw and quarter 
that be the question vou ever think in -PRON- life captain sali think now cry the professor brush the sweat from -PRON- forehead with a fold of -PRON- tunic 
cord cord shout count zylox 
dind -PRON- 
lord nyli i exclaim -PRON- appeal to -PRON- 
the king be in no danger 
i swear -PRON- 
danger repeat the captain of the guard 
-PRON- lie like a log i tell -PRON- and -PRON- end be near 
not so clamor the professor 
that be the way the elixir work 
do -PRON- not see -PRON- swallow -PRON- 
and -PRON- friend there 
if -PRON- have be poison -PRON- -PRON- would be dead or die 
look out -PRON- relic of the stone age -PRON- be stick -PRON- brush aside a spear point that be make -PRON- too keenly feel 
what -PRON- say be true i aver 
in a few hour the king will be -PRON- again will not believe -PRON- be the fierce response of count zylox 
rather than bother with bind -PRON- -PRON- would perhaps be as well for -PRON- to run -PRON- through not that speak up lord nylis 
the king have place these gentleman in -PRON- charge and i be responsible for -PRON- with -PRON- head 
but the king be pass 
-PRON- gentleman say not 
i yield up -PRON- guest only on the king order count zylox king be incapable of give order 
-PRON- will issue -PRON- when -PRON- be capable 
what if -PRON- die 
in that event i take -PRON- command from princess ylma 
count zylox be an exceedingly angry man 
-PRON- stamp about the terrace in -PRON- buskin 
-PRON- hospitality have take a rathet grim turn count observe -PRON- lordship must request that -PRON- have -PRON- chur lower -PRON- weapon 
and permit these foreign devil to escape cry the exasperate count 
by no means 
guard -PRON- until -PRON- have further news of the king 
the count gnaw -PRON- under lip for a moment 
then -PRON- say -PRON- will tarry three hour 
by that time a courier from the palace will let -PRON- know whether the king live or be dead 
if -PRON- live -PRON- wish will be bring by the courier say lord nyli and shall be implicitly obey 
and if -PRON- die 
if -PRON- die these foreigner shall suffer death by oyd well say the count and give order that cause the chur to withdraw and marshal -PRON- in a column behind prebble and -PRON- 
i sit down on -PRON- couch and prebble sit down on -PRON- 
this constant peril be most try to the nerve for -PRON- never seem ableto tell when the lightning be go to strike or how 
this death by oyd murmur prebble what be -PRON- -PRON- lordship 
if the king die and the princess ylma so command as -PRON- undoubtedly will in that event -PRON- foot will be securely bind to thefeetof -PRON- friend 
a block of zellin properly screen will be chain to -PRON- wrist and a be chain to the wrist of -PRON- 
the screen will then be by degree 
-PRON- will be pull north -PRON- friend south 
first a force equivalent to six man will drag at -PRON- limb pull against each other then twelve man then eighteen then the full twentyfour 
-PRON- be awful to contempate the very fiendishness of -PRON- fairly sicken -PRON- 
-PRON- be the punishment for high treason comment the count glower at -PRON- 
wait six hour instead of three implore prebble three heur only snap the count 
how slowly the minute drag 
surround and guard to make sure that -PRON- do not escape prebble and i endeavor to compose -PRON- nerve be afraid of something like this professor say -PRON- would be rather a humorous situation say prebble if these nyllite werenot so ignorant 
what a sight for godsand man to see king boazar prone upon the throne surround by -PRON- griefstricken court and only give vent to hiccup and gurgle and the two mysterious word whash mazzer the professor forget -PRON- own desperate situation so far as to cackle with suppress merriment liable to be anything but a laugh matter for -PRON- and -PRON- prebble i admonish -PRON- 
how can there be a tragedy 
the king will come out of -PRON- trance and word will be send to release -PRON- 
suppose the court doctor get busy with the king 
-PRON- donot understand what ail -PRON- and -PRON- may resort to heroic measure 
-PRON- may suecumb to th measure but the clixir will be charge up with -PRON- and of course -PRON- be already charge up with the elixir 
prebble look worried something in that captain -PRON- fal tere wish -PRON- could get word to those doctor to keep -PRON- hand off 
what good would -PRON- do -PRON- to get word to -PRON- 
i inquire 
do -PRON- think -PRON- would pay any attention to -PRON- wish in the matter one way or the other 
possibly not 
certainly not not a doubt as to the position -PRON- occupy in the land of nyll 
let -PRON- suppose say the professor that the king case be not aggravate by the solicitude of -PRON- physician 
qur danger will pass in that event 
very likely provide these troublesome chur be not goad into something violent by zylox 
the captain of the guard be still tramp fretfully up and down itch to be at and yet not dare to override the instruction of the king count be in a hard row of stump i go on to prebble give -PRON- eye to see -PRON- impale on the poing of those spear but if the king should recover the count would be call on to pay with -PRON- head for -PRON- rash action 
and lord nyli too add prebble 
an execution by oyd -PRON- proceed -PRON- thought take a gruesome trend must be a particularly horrible performance 
-PRON- have the electric chair beat both way say slowly but relentlessly a victim be pull to piece 
a sicken pallor spread -PRON- over the professor face 
sit upright on -PRON- couch -PRON- shade -PRON- eye with one hand and look off along the road that lead to the palace wonder why some one doesnot come from the king -PRON- worry 
no one will come until the king either die or recover sufciently to tell -PRON- court that -PRON- have no intention of die i answer 
lord nyli observe that some of the chur be becbme rather overzealous in -PRON- guard duty place -PRON- closer to prebble and -PRON- 
a single look which -PRON- throw at the hairy warrior dampen -PRON- vengeful ardor and -PRON- draw back 
this condition of -PRON- majesty remark -PRON- lordship turn to prebble seem an odd way of renew youth 
and yet -PRON- declare that the elixir work in that manner -PRON- majesty take too much of -PRON- say prebble 
too much be dangerous not at all 
too much merely stupefie 
so the king be out of -PRON- sense 
nothing bad have befall -PRON- lord nyli i assure -PRON- 
be there many court physician dozen or more 
do -PRON- suppose the whole dozen of -PRON- be work over the king 
undoubtedly 
prebble could not restrain a groan dozen doctor captain say -PRON- turn in -PRON- direction apt to cause tragic complicatlon the doctor just then be a prolific source of danger for the professor andme and second only to the doctor stand count zylox and the chur guard 
the physician will do everything possible speak up lord nyli hope no doubt to set -PRON- at -PRON- ease 
could -PRON- not send word to the physician return prebble that all the king need be to be let alone physician i presume do not understand the king malady say nyli but certainly -PRON- can do no harm 
send word anyhow implore prebble 
tell the messenger to annournce at the palace that the stranger guarantee the king recovery but that the physician must not mix up in the matter 
if i do that and the king do not recover say lord nyli should be condemn to death -PRON- 
there be no use insist and the minute continue to drag 
-PRON- seem as though i have live an age before -PRON- eye eagerly scan the road see a small oyd car come fly to -PRON- lordships step 
one chur and one nyllite be the passenger 
bound to the ground the nyllite dash up the slope toward -PRON- flash the king ring in -PRON- hand come from princess cry the courier 
why the princess ylma 
i ask -PRON- 
if the king be not dead why be the princess ylma assume the prerogative of government 
what of the king demand the count 
-PRON- recover tell -PRON- so jubilate the professor 
be -PRON- well ask the count 
bar a headache 
the lord in wait be attend -PRON- 
what say the princess ylmar that under no circumstance be the stranger to be injure 
i begin to breathe once more 
prebble be again -PRON- cocksure and assertive self 
the count come forward and i think -PRON- look like a man 
-PRON- bow to -PRON- humbly 
pardon the disagreeable interruption say -PRON- 
when i come again -PRON- will be by -PRON- majestys command 
-PRON- give order to -PRON- chur and -PRON- defile toward -PRON- oyd car 
the messenger have already return to -PRON- and be race back whence -PRON- come presently the large car get in motion and -PRON- be leave alone with -PRON- genial host as before 
prebble settle -PRON- comfortably on -PRON- couch continue to delve for fact 
regard these chur say -PRON- be -PRON- animal pure and simple -PRON- lordship whether or not -PRON- have soul reply -PRON- lordship be a moot point 
-PRON- have a certain amount of reason but be so brutelike that only -PRON- superior mind hold -PRON- in check 
a commission of -PRON- wise man appoint by the king be now make experiment to discover whether the chur be imbue with the immortal gpark 
-PRON- be all slave 
every one outside the great wall 
if -PRON- be not hold down with a will of iron -PRON- would rebel and seek to overthrow -PRON- 
fear alone keep the horde of chur back of the great wall 
if -PRON- once lose this fear -PRON- would swarm over the wall and lie this kingdom in ashe 
wall query the professor scent another mystery 
boazar of illustrious memory encircle the land of the chur with a great wall of granite 
since then -PRON- mind have develop in power to an extent that give -PRON- no fear of -PRON- traditional enemy 
the only disaster that could befall -PRON- would be a dethronement of reason an eclipse of -PRON- faculty 
this would vive the chur -PRON- opportunity here -PRON- lordship straighten proudly -PRON- brain continue to improve while the chur continue to sink into barbarism and brutality 
some day -PRON- shall grow so strong that -PRON- can invade the country of the chur enslave -PRON- all and after that gradually train -PRON- and so well -PRON- condition 
-PRON- be the dream of boazar one day to emancipate the slave 
but this will not come for many generation not until such an act be entirely safe 
-PRON- speak of the chur as traditional cnemie -PRON- be here when lokai the bold break throuch the ice wall and settle the land an event which take place in the night of prehistoric time 
then the chur roam through the sun of the long day and through the blackness of the long night fighting rend each other like beast 
lokai war with -PRON- and drive -PRON- out with sword and spear 
but sword and spear be useless against -PRON- 
-PRON- multiply amazingly and return again and again to the attack 
only the irresistible power of the brain be efficacious and not until the descendant of lokai begin to develop and use these latent power be there any peace in the land 
this be glorious murmur the professor 
-PRON- be an ideal statea kingdom of the mind with the power of darkness under heel 
but here a poiht -PRON- ancestor lokai the bold penetrate the ice wall 
have -PRON- people never try to reach the world whence -PRON- come 
expedition after expedition have try but in all save one instance without success 
the cultivation of mental power have ill prepare -PRON- to cope with the rigor of ice and cold 
brute endurance be need there 
nevertheless in -PRON- own generation the ice have be successfully conquer by one gneiseti 
-PRON- do not live to return butsent back a gort plate tie to an eagle leg 
the gorr plate tell -PRON- thing of the outside world that have entirely wipe out all desire to know more about -PRON- 
gorr plate exclaim prebble deeper -PRON- go the thick the mystery 
what in the name of all that s good be a gorr plate 
-PRON- be a square of chalcedony a thought record 
-PRON- wish to communicate with one another so -PRON- send thought and impression not word 
on the chalcedony square -PRON- place -PRON- hand -PRON- think the thought record -PRON- in the plate 
the plate be send to the one -PRON- would have know -PRON- wish or experience and -PRON- or -PRON- layshand on the plate and the thought of the communicant come to the brain 
prebble jump to -PRON- foot and walk around -PRON- couch 
then -PRON- sit down again -PRON- head in -PRON- hand 
have -PRON- one of these gorr plate in -PRON- pocket -PRON- inquire 
lord nyli smile 
no but if i have -PRON- would be nothing but so much chalcedony to -PRON- 
-PRON- mindpardon mei not cultivate along the proper line 
at thls imply doubt of -PRON- mentallty prebble bristle up 
the next moment however the irritation pass 
will -PRON- read this gorr plate send home by gneisen -PRON- ask 
tt js in the archive of the king palace 
but i have the gist of -PRON- in -PRON- mind 
what be thought 
horrible 
-PRON- recordeei impression of two thing in particular that fill -PRON- with disgust and despair for the human race 
one of these thing be a thin silver disk with a womans head on one side and an eagle on the other 
there be also a motto in god -PRON- trust 
the desire to accumulate these fetich be so strong that people do not hesitate to betray a trust barter -PRON- honor and sometimes -PRON- life for the insensateobject there be those who have million more of these than -PRON- need and other who have not one 
-PRON- be a mad race accordmg to gneisen and many of the weak be crush trample on and slain 
the professor look at -PRON- and indulge in a sly wink 
-PRON- lordship be on ground familiar to -PRON- but neither prebble nor i have anything to say 
what be the other thing that fill -PRON- with disgust and despair lord nyli query the professor 
-PRON- be a brown fluid in glass receptacle go on -PRON- lordship fluid be even more insatiable in devour honor and life than be the silver disk 
-PRON- strike at the mind with sledgehammer blow accord to gneisen make rave beast of sensible man and finally bring horrible death 
the wonder be that sensible man would have anything to do with -PRON- 
do -PRON- know anything about this fluid believe i have hear of -PRON- mumble the professor 
talk about gorr plate be -PRON- possible to prebble thus deftly shift the topic 
the gorr platesi be wonderful enough but i be not particularly interested in -PRON- at that moment 
-PRON- fancy fly to princess ylma 
young beautiful only child of the reign kingwhat could there be in such a fate to commend the piin8ess to -PRON- lordship commiseration 
i resolve to find out 
at that moment lord nyli be deep in an earnest discussion with prebble and while wait for a chance to put in a word on -PRON- own account i fall asleep 
how long i sleep be of no importance 
the period seem brief but -PRON- may have be hour in duration i waken abruptly and start to a sit posture 
-PRON- lordship be go but on the couch near mine lie prebble count zylox stand over -PRON- 
behind the count be the same detachment of soldier that have accompany -PRON- on -PRON- previous visit 
the professor be just open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- here again -PRON- exclaim start up and cast a quick glance at the forbidding face of the chur 
by the king express command answer the count 
how be -PRON- royal highness inquire prebble 
-PRON- be feel much well and desire that -PRON- refill this flask forthwith 
the captain draw the bottle from the breast of -PRON- tunic and extend -PRON- toward prebble 
-PRON- majesty must have more of -PRON- elixir within the hour 
blockhead that -PRON- be 
why have -PRON- not foreseen this contingency 
still if -PRON- have foresee -PRON- what could -PRON- have do to save -PRON- 
-PRON- be possible -PRON- could have steal an oyd car give the zellin cube free reign and thus reach the pole 
would -PRON- have better -PRON- condition by so do 
may not the savage chur have kill -PRON- out of hand 
there be no time to waste in useless surmise 
count zylox represent the king and the king mean business 
mercy on -PRON- man gurgle the proiessor 
do -PRON- think i carry a supply of the elixir around with -PRON- and have -PRON- constantly on tap 
the count smile sardonically think nothing at all 
the king command that i bring -PRON- the elixir within the hour 
if -PRON- refuse to comply with -PRON- reasonable demand i be to convey -PRON- into the serene presence the point of a spear 
as to which i do i be indifferent 
zlox have educate -PRON- head at the expense of -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have no kindly feel for -PRON- and order be order old prebble 
i see -PRON- now as i see -PRON- then clasp -PRON- bony hand shake as with an aue look despairingly from the count to the file of chur 
suddenly -PRON- sink back on the couch with a muffled groan -PRON- stony cye uptdrned to the cloudless vault overhead 
where be lord nylis 
i strike in think -PRON- host may devise some way out of the difficulty 
nyli can be of no assistance to -PRON- return the officer frigidly 
be i to have the elixir or be i not must consult privately with the other prophet -PRON- companion say prebble be a matter of some moment 
have i -PRON- permission to engage -PRON- friend in a brief conversation escape be impossible warn count zylox sternly 
lam a0 t contemplate anything of that sort 
very well 
proceed with -PRON- conversation 
the professor get up come over to -PRON- couch and sit down beside -PRON- 
captain say -PRON- be -PRON- asleep or do -PRON- wake up in time to hear what be go on overheard -PRON- all i reply 
well what be -PRON- to do in this case not a thing -PRON- can do so far as i can discover 
the king have send an ultimatum more elixir or death to the stranger 
-PRON- be a mistake to tell the king that the bourbon be a product of -PRON- skill presume reflect prebble that the whisky could be distil but -PRON- would take time 
and the king be in a hurry get to fill the flask at once or suffer the consequence 
then -PRON- must suffer the consequence say i chieerlessly 
the professor problem be grow more and more difficult of solution 
largely -PRON- present predicament be owe to the professor extravagant claim with respect to -PRON- power as prophet 
a prophet be not really a wizard and yet -PRON- learned companion in -PRON- conference with the king have rather imply that such be the case while count zylox watch warily from a distance and the barbarian of -PRON- guard stand ready to discorage any attempt at escape the professor pucker up -PRON- brow and turn the matter over in -PRON- mind 
-PRON- may as well give up prebble say harass -PRON- with further posing 
-PRON- canot conjure a demijohn of rum out of the air 
tell zylox to do -PRON- bad 
if -PRON- could secure another audience with the king return prebble -PRON- may be able to do something that would postpone -PRON- fate deceive -PRON- 
the king be thoroughly in earnest 
when an appetite for bourbon be arouse -PRON- know how difficult -PRON- be to combat -PRON- donone well 
the imperial appetite wait only upon the imperial will and the king word be law 
but captain perhaps if i tell -PRON- majesty that a little time would be require to minister to -PRON- desire -PRON- would grant a stay of sentence that would only prolong the agony say and what s the use 
while there s life there s hope 
so long as -PRON- can keep from be spit on the lance of the chur or from be draw and quarter by oyd and suboyd i choose to believe that chance of ultimate escape will favor -PRON- 
that may be 
i be as anxious to live as -PRON- be prebble for the object of -PRON- lifelong ambition have be to attain the pole 
now that -PRON- be so near the pole -PRON- seem too bad that chance and a flask of bourbon should conspire to disappoint -PRON- 
suppose -PRON- could escape now murmur the professor with a wary glance at zylox and the churssuch a supposition be folly 
i protest 
no one know what a man can do to save -PRON- life until -PRON- be put to the test 
a rush an exchange of blow and a little of that fortune which favor the brave and the desperate may carry -PRON- to the road and the oyd car 
then away captainaway with the screen tear from the cube of zellin and -PRON- speed an eagle flight 
i stare at -PRON- in amazement 
if -PRON- own action in seek to escape from the throne room have be reckless and illconsidere present suggestion be even more so 
-PRON- be out of -PRON- wit prebble say in the first place -PRON- could never get clear of this press of chur alive 
take that for grant at the outset grant -PRON- this captain that -PRON- be a forlorn hope but well that than nohope at all 
-PRON- be not even a forlorn hope go onseverely 
suppose -PRON- reach the car therewould remain the operating of -PRON- 
what do -PRON- know about that 
-PRON- know what lord ll tell -PRON- on the way here answer the professor confidently 
all one have to do in drive an ovd car be to lift the screen and steer 
admit that -PRON- could escape from the guard and reach and successfully operate the car where be -PRON- to go 
anywhere 
safety lie in flight sali and where that flight take -PRON- be not a particular point 
yes -PRON- ismost particular 
if -PRON- could get to the pole and fall into the hand of the chur 
not that well i shall not join -PRON- in any such mad enterprise 
if argument canot save -PRON- force certainly can not 
-PRON- get up and go back to -PRON- own couch 
fling -PRON- down on -PRON- back -PRON- fix -PRON- eye thoughtfully upon the zenith 
see that -PRON- interview have terminate the impatient zylox approach the professor 
have -PRON- decide the count demand be wait to be move in the business mumble the professor 
time press return zylox ask -PRON- be i to have the elixir or be i not 
-PRON- be screech prebble hurl -PRON- to -PRON- foot tell the king i be a great prophet and -PRON- shall see i be not without honor even in this country 
obsrv 
watch 
i shall work a spell to fulfill the king desire 
ah ha 
room there 
give -PRON- room 
-PRON- zave -PRON- room plenty of -PRON- 
i fear that danger have suddenly turn the professor brain and that -PRON- have go stark staring mad 
-PRON- whoop -PRON- howl -PRON- throw -PRON- inte the most amazing attitude and fan the air with -PRON- arm 
i look on horrified 
count zylox gaze at the contortion of -PRON- learned friend in startled wonder 
as for the chur -PRON- superstitious mind be imagine dire thing and -PRON- seem more than half inclined to run 
suddenly the air above -PRON- be rent with a terrific explosion 
simultaneously with the explo sion the heavens be light by a flash of reddish fire ghastly in the broad light of day 
every eye turn aloft 
a blaze balloon be drop earthward like a lead plummet and follow the airy track of the balloon at slow pace and with hairfaising gyration be parachute two man be cling to theparachute recognize one of -PRON- as -PRON- rival griffyn the other as pollock -PRON- secretary and companion 
the burn balloon drop into the roadway the wickerwork car load with food scientific instrument and other impedimenta strike the ground with a prodigious thump 
griffyn and -PRON- companion alight a moment later on the terrace and not more than a dozen foot from prebble 
the englishman be stun by the shock and lie on the ground in a state of dazed bewilderment 
without loss of a second prebble bound to griffyn bent over -PRON- search -PRON- pocket and arise triumphantly with a nickel plate flask 
turn upon the astourtde captain of the guard prebble present the flask with a low bow 
the elixir be not in the same flask count say -PRON- but i do not think -PRON- majesty will be overparticular 
-PRON- give -PRON- great pleasure to comply with -PRON- majestys command 
prebble be not mad on the contrary -PRON- wasj very levellleaded 
but what would -PRON- have do if there have be no flask in the pocket of either griffyn or -PRON- secretary 
the professor afterward tell -PRON- that in fall backward on the couch the despair gaze -PRON- turn upward have encounter the balioon 
the airship be in difficulty plunge wildly and make ready to fall 
griftyn and pollock be even then take to the void with theirparachute 
idea come rapidly continue prebble for be between the chur and the deep sea so to speak and -PRON- life as well as mine hang in the balance 
chance be that either griffyn or pollock have a flask and those be the chance i have to take 
a special providence watch over child andand other captain and i get the flask 
i think count zylox be deeply impressed 
at any rate -PRON- hand tremble as -PRON- take the flask from prebble 
the chur be flat on the ground face downward 
-PRON- be -PRON- customary attitude when anything occur which to -PRON- be supernatural 
before the count entirely recover or the chur arise griffyn be on -PRON- foot and have advance to where i be stand 
-PRON- face be vacuous -PRON- eye stare know -PRON- but -PRON- be one thing to cut a man from -PRON- balloon and launch -PRON- into eternity and another thing to meet -PRON- again front to front 
finally -PRON- speak but there be no sense to -PRON- word 
i answer -PRON- and that -PRON- fail to understand -PRON- be evident from the blank lvok -PRON- wear haf be wrong 
have i forget -PRON- mother tongue 
remove the talk ring captain suggest prebble give -PRON- english and -PRON- be give -PRON- nyll 
i remove the talk ring 
while wear -PRON- i think in nyll talk in -PRON- and -PRON- own language be a dead letter 
captain sali breathe griffyn 
captain sali can i belive -PRON- eye 
-PRON- cast a brother mariner adrift in nudheaven say i cuttingly 
no wonder -PRON- be surprised to meet -PRON- again alive and hearty 
-PRON- take a base advantage of -PRON- -PRON- protest warmly 
-PRON- attach yeurselve to the drag anchor in the hope of reach the pole neck and neck with -PRON- 
rubbish explode a sane man griffyn and -PRON- do not really think that prebble and i would do such a thing and run the risk of have -PRON- life batter out against the top of some iceberg 
-PRON- mutter in -PRON- beard 
at last -PRON- observe -PRON- have be hover over this country for hour drive back and forth by one current and then another 
the intense heat or something else burst -PRON- balloon and the have no interest in -PRON- misadventure say i coldly 
-PRON- cut -PRON- adrift and -PRON- be save by a miracle only to find -PRON- in the midst of a sea of danger 
-PRON- will be youlr business to share some of these danger with -PRON- 
pollock come up just then burst with question 
but pollock be the kind of man i leave out of -PRON- calculation 
-PRON- be the son of a rich distiller i have be inform and -PRON- father have help -PRON- to a place in expedition by subscribe twenty thousand pound to the exploration fund 
count zylox and prebble be hold an animate conversation and i don -PRON- talk ring to take part in -PRON- 
these be the two fiend speak of in that tradition of your count the wily professor be say 
take -PRON- back with -PRON- to the king keep -PRON- in confinement and watch -PRON- well 
tt shall be do the count answer cheerfully 
-PRON- be show a good deal of respect for -PRON- since the professor have work -PRON- spell 
tell the king i put in that -PRON- request -PRON- not to deal with the prisoner in a summary manner 
prebble throw a surprised look at -PRON- 
-PRON- could not understand i suppose why i wish to spare the englishman when -PRON- have show no disposition to spare -PRON- will carry -PRON- message to the king say count zylox 
thereupon -PRON- order the chur to make prisoner of griffyn and pollock but the englishman set -PRON- shoulder together and prepare to resist 
i have never doubt courage so i be not surprlse to find -PRON- show -PRON- tooth -PRON- begin to jook call the count to -PRON- as though these stranger would have to be roughly deal with 
would -PRON- care to speak with -PRON- and give -PRON- a little good advice know of no way in which -PRON- could serve -PRON- better will see what i can do say i 
then remove the mystical ring from iy brow i step up in front of griffyn and pollock be rash griffyn i advise -PRON- be outnumber and -PRON- have just come through a severe shake up 
by jove -PRON- cry brandish -PRON- fist if these swab be sicken for something well do -PRON- good to oblige -PRON- 
what sort of a way be this to receive stranger be tactful and -PRON- will find these people hospitable and kind 
resort to violence and -PRON- will let loose a storm that will break on -PRON- own head know because i have have some experience with the way of the country 
what sort of a country be -PRON- 
really magnificentand something of a paradox 
the inhabitant be wel advanced in the art and science and the labor of the ruling race be entirely on the mental order 
i havenot be here long enough to make any detailed explanation but i can assure -PRON- that a resort to fisticufl will not prosper vour cause 
what have -PRON- in -PRON- hand there -PRON- ask survey the object curiously 
an example of the scientific progress -PRON- have find in this country i answer 
this be a talk ring and talk ring -PRON- echo wideeye 
precisely 
by adjust -PRON- properly be able to think in the language of the people and to talk to -PRON- and to understand -PRON- 
what bally nonsense be -PRON- give -PRON- be try to tell -PRON- thing which -PRON- incredulity will not allow -PRON- to believe say but for all that i be speak the truth 
-PRON- be put in the professor but -PRON- be waste -PRON- time 
count zylox in charge of the guard be go to take -PRON- and pollock alive or dead to the king of the country 
sali out of a generous feeling toward -PRON- which be not warrant by -PRON- past behavior have volunteer to pursuade -PRON- to go with the count without resistance 
if -PRON- be wise griffyn -PRON- will heed the advice of captain sali 
salis have something at the back of -PRON- head declare griffyn suspiciously 
what be -PRON- up to -PRON- fling at -PRON- pointblank 
justify although i may be in act and think otherwise i answer do not wish to see any harm come to -PRON- griffyn 
-PRON- be try to beat -PRON- out in come at the pole 
something tell -PRON- that -PRON- be play the game even now 
where do -PRON- think -PRON- be griffyn 
i inquire 
in what latitude and longitude havenot be able to take an observation for some time and i havenot the least idea say -PRON- 
-PRON- will discover all about that and many other thing of interest to -PRON- if -PRON- go peacefully with count zylox not -PRON- cry obstinately 
here -PRON- add reach out -PRON- hand let -PRON- take -PRON- talk ring 
if -PRON- be all -PRON- say give this count a piece of -PRON- mind in short order 
prebble look at -PRON- and shake -PRON- head mean to signify that -PRON- would not be safe just then to make -PRON- possible for griffyn to converse understandingly with count zylox 
griffyn may do other thing besides give the count a piece of -PRON- mind 
for instance -PRON- would have be possible for -PRON- to give information that would be a detriment to prebble and -PRON- 
i shall not allow -PRON- to sample the power of -PRON- talk ring i answer 
do -PRON- know what -PRON- impression be ask griffyn donot know as that matter materially but -PRON- may as well tell -PRON- 
-PRON- and prebble be mad 
as pollock and i come down onthe parachute -PRON- see prebble throw -PRON- about in a crazy sort of way 
why do -PRON- rob -PRON- of -PRON- flask 
why do -PRON- hand -PRON- over to that fellow in the mother hubbard a black business afoot sali if -PRON- turn out that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be not mad 
will -PRON- go peaceably 
i ask to cut the conference short 
-PRON- be go to fight to the last breath -PRON- aver 
i put on the talk ring and step back 
-PRON- wonot listen to reason count zylox say take -PRON- but do -PRON- carefully 
again the count order -PRON- chur to make prisoner of griffyn and pollock 
although -PRON- resist like true driton -PRON- be easily overcome and bear away 
zylox would also have carry off the wreek of the balloon have not prebble vigorously object 
i could not imagine what prebble want with the remain of the airship 
in du urse however -PRON- idea be communicate to -PRON- and i find -PRON- particularly bright 
the departure of zylox and th guard with the prisoner leave prebble and -PRON- alone and to -PRON- own device 
during these momentous event lord nyli have not show -PRON- 
nor have any one issue from the palace to make inquiry or to take part in the proceeding 
the hour be ripe for something of moment to transpire and i be not keep long in suspense 
now captain say prebble after a swift precautionary glance around -PRON- -PRON- must get to work without loss of time 
at what sort of work 
i inquire 
-PRON- will find out presently 
-PRON- must act first and then do -PRON- talk 
-PRON- gather up -PRON- tunic about -PRON- thin leg and put off down the terrace toward the road 
i hurry along in -PRON- wake and ome -PRON- beside the wickerwork balloon car 
nothing remain of the basket but a jumble of broken reed 
there be a water can knocked into a cocked hat and trickle -PRON- content over the road also a number of scientific instrument a shotgun and cartridze lelt and a bag contain pemmican and ship biscuit 
the scientific instrument be ruin but the bag of food be in good condition and the gun and ammunition appear to be uninjure 
bring the biscuit and pemmican captain say prebble take possession of the firearm and belt stow these away where -PRON- can find -PRON- when want and then hold a council of war 
the article be hide in a clump of bush and -PRON- return to -PRON- couch on the terrace 
prebble be rub -PRON- hand delightedly count on find the food say -PRON- but the shotgun and the ammunition be a stroke of luck 
just what -PRON- need too think of make a run for -PRON- be -PRON- 
i ask -PRON- return look around apprehensively 
come over to -PRON- couch -PRON- sit down beside -PRON- nothing else for -PRON- captain -PRON- proceed am of -PRON- opinion i return 
-PRON- position here be become untenable -PRON- resume 
the king will want more of the elixir and if -PRON- be not forthcome -PRON- will be impale on the same spear and convey into the royal presence 
-PRON- may have reason that out before say think -PRON- but -PRON- need time in which to recuperate after -PRON- long fast and to adjust -PRON- to certain of the country 
food and rest have prepare -PRON- physically and now that -PRON- be acquaint with the mechanism of the oyd car and be possess of a shotgun and a bag of food -PRON- be well equipped for flight 
-PRON- must have the car 
car be plentiful 
-PRON- will lie in wait along the road then with the aid of the shotgun -PRON- can take possession of the first car that come along 
after that away to the south en route for home 
to the south i exclaim 
certalnly -PRON- canot go astray captain 
the cube of iron will draw -PRON- along the proper road 
-PRON- will make in the direction of least resistance 
good heaven 
i rie -PRON- think the oyd car will carry -PRON- over the ice wall and the open sea how do -PRON- know there be an open sea as for the ice wall que transtulii sustinet 
-PRON- good star be above -PRON- 
south -PRON- must goit be the only way 
-PRON- be not the only way 
i declare 
-PRON- hope lie in the zellin cube and -PRON- must go whither -PRON- take -PRON- 
to the land of the chur -PRON- dear sir palpitate prebble 
-PRON- would be slaughter on sight 
have -PRON- not have sufficient experience with these man brute 
remember how superstitious the chur be i urge 
the report of that revolver be enough to vanquish -PRON- and now -PRON- have a shotgun 
think of that read -PRON- captain say the professor disgruntle 
griffyn have arrive 
-PRON- fear that -PRON- will reach the pole first impel -PRON- to take any chance however desperate 
i go south sir 
and i go north 
i return firmly 
-PRON- will divide the pemmican and the ship hiscuit 
and the shotgun -PRON- ask coolly 
-PRON- will draw straw for the shotgun 
-PRON- can get -PRON- own oyd car and i will -PRON- can not quarrel over this matter interrupt prebble nor can -PRON- divide -PRON- slender force and resource in the face of such a desperate contingency 
-PRON- must stand or falt together captain sali be in charge of the expedition say i sternly 
when -PRON- join -PRON- -PRON- agree to obey order 
-PRON- be quite correct -PRON- answer be overlook that point be resolve to bear away to the land of the chur 
that be what -PRON- shall do 
-PRON- be under -PRON- order and -PRON- will obey whatever hist 
-PRON- lordship 
i look up hastily 
lord nyli be approach -PRON- across the terrace 
klimon in the road below be sit in the point of -PRON- lordship conveyance gentleman begin lord nylis -PRON- face trouble the fame of -PRON- elixir have spread throughout the kingdom 
to the lord in wait -PRON- majesty have describe -PRON- effect upon the system so eloquently that all be wild to try the new fluid for -PRON- 
the second flask the king claim as -PRON- own to the last drop 
but -PRON- order -PRON- through -PRON- to work another spell for one thousand keese of the elixir 
if not too much trouble to -PRON- -PRON- desire that -PRON- have -PRON- fall at the palace step 
menial be already wait there with goblet 
-PRON- heart smote wildly against -PRON- rib 
have -PRON- be too late with -PRON- pilan for flight 
how much be a keese -PRON- lordship 
prebble inquire with a businesslike air two blick make one keese 
a blick i should say be about the quantity contain in the second flask 
in other word say prebble briskly the king want two thousand flask of -PRON- elixir rain down in front of -PRON- palace 
the menial arewaite -PRON- lordship repeat and the king household be impatient 
-PRON- shall have to repair to the king palace to make the incantation say prebble 
while speak -PRON- telegraph -PRON- a message with -PRON- if -PRON- flee -PRON- must be now or never 
whether north or south make little difference 
the thing be to get away before the household grow too impatient imagine as much remark -PRON- lordship gravely 
if -PRON- gentleman will descend to the oyd car will retire into the palace for ten minute or less and rejoin -PRON- the moment i have finish the business that detain -PRON- 
this be important or i should not delay 
nothing could have be more opportune 
-PRON- lordship go one way and prebble and i the other 
the bag of food and the gun mutter prebble 
-PRON- must have those before -PRON- go to the oyd car 
proceed to the clump of bush -PRON- bring out the article 
as the executive end of the expedition i assume charge of the gun and belt strap the latter over -PRON- tunic about -PRON- waist 
next -PRON- steal silently upon the oyd car 
approach the unconscious klimon from the rear i tumble -PRON- incontinently into the road and jump into -PRON- seat 
prebble be already up behind 
with the shotgun firmly hold between -PRON- knee i bend over the power box and lift the screen 
away jump the car with a suddenness that almost throw the professor into the road 
and not an instant too soon 
the dazed klimon have bound to -PRON- foot and grab at the rear of the vehicle miss -PRON- by no more than a hairbreadth 
-PRON- pursue -PRON- but -PRON- may as well have try to overtake a whirlwind 
-PRON- be head for the land of the chur and for the north pole 
all fear be lose in the excitement of the moment 
-PRON- nerve be not so prey upon that reason fail -PRON- and while bend over the zellin box one hand on the screen and the other on the steering lever i have a few thought pertinent to the situation 
when -PRON- have leave the king palace klimon have use the zellin cube 
that mean of course that -PRON- have proceed in a northerly direction 
to use the suboyd power as represent by the iron block would have be to drive back through the heart of the kingdom 
flight in that direction mean undoubted capture 
another pomnt i be not sufficiently familiar with oyd car to distinguish the iron box from the zellin box 
-PRON- lordship car however have just come from the king palace 
the zellin cube must have be use and therefor -PRON- be reasonable to infer that this cube be still ready for duty 
i do not pull out the screen to -PRON- full extent and thus give the car the full power 
-PRON- could easily distance klimon with half the oyd force and i want to accustom -PRON- to run the machine before urge -PRON- to -PRON- utmost 
the car be easily handle 
the rear wheel be the rudder and -PRON- resistance be strong in move any way short of due north 
the feel of the tiller if i may be allow the expression be an indication of the direction -PRON- be go 
as i figure -PRON- -PRON- be head north by east 
suddenly i be startle out of -PRON- reflection 
directly ahead and bear down on -PRON- be the official oyd car contain count zylox and the detachment of the guard 
a groan come from prebble after -PRON- captain be the burden of -PRON- lament 
i be of the same opinion 
but there be no retreat for -PRON- and -PRON- must go ahead and look pleasant 
keep a stiff upper lip prebble i call over -PRON- shoulder wave -PRON- hand and laugh as -PRON- pass the count think be out for a little spin just for the fun of the thing 
-PRON- may think be bind for the palace say the professor revive 
-PRON- wonot think that be go directly away from the palace 
then -PRON- canot be come from the palace can -PRON- 
no but -PRON- may be after -PRON- all the same there 
now hail -PRON- laugh and be hearty about -PRON- 
the count have slow down -PRON- car and be watch -PRON- with surprise and suspicion 
ahoy there count 
i yell as -PRON- speed by 
how be i for a navigator anyway prebble give a laugh but there be not much heartiness in if 
where be -PRON- go shout the count 
yes roar back at -PRON- to understand draw out the screen a little farther could not look behind and manage the car so i ask prebble what the count be do keep right on return the professor 
great colossus -PRON- sputter aghast 
what now 
i demand 
klimon dash along the road captain meet the count of course 
tell -PRON- whether the count stop to talk with the chur prebble 
lopk alive now right in front of the official car salis 
the count have get to halt or run over the chur wave -PRON- hand 
well i dare not take -PRON- attention from -PRON- work to look behind but have to depend on the professor to keep -PRON- informed of what be go on 
-PRON- shall soon be push to the last extremity captain cry prebble 
-PRON- ought to be use to that by this time i answer grimly 
the count have stop -PRON- car and be talk with klimon mean pursuit by a highpowered car a car that can walk upon -PRON- hand over fist klimon fling -PRON- into the official car go on prebble and there be nothing else for couldnot resist look back 
the official car be just turn to head toward -PRON- as i fling the look over -PRON- shoulder 
at that moment -PRON- speed over an uneven place in the road 
i lurch wildly and be throw down on the zellin box 
one of -PRON- hand be on the slide screen and as i drop forward the screen be push home abruptly shut off the power of the cube and bring -PRON- to a slow pace so abruptly that prebble already wabble because of the thankyoumaam go by the board precipitately 
i have a fleeting glimpse of -PRON- stand on -PRON- head heel in the air 
abandon the professor be farth fromi -PRON- mind and i jam down on the brake and bring the car to a standstill 
prebble 
i yell 
-PRON- be lie sprawl out on the earth a dozen foot behind 
as ill luck would have -PRON- -PRON- be silent and inert and apparently have meet with injury which may prove serious 
in the distance approach swiftly be the other car moment be precious but i leap from the seat and be about to start for prebble when -PRON- suddenly sit up 
come on 
i shout 
hurry 
although daze -PRON- be not long in pick up the trend of event 
-PRON- see the car with -PRON- laad of warlike chur and scramble to -PRON- foot with mere haste than grace 
merciful power -PRON- stutter 
-PRON- have almost gain the car when -PRON- whirl and turn back 
what be -PRON- try to do 
i roar 
just at that moment i see -PRON- bend and pick up the glitter circlet 
the talk ring have drop from -PRON- head during -PRON- fall and -PRON- have go back after -PRON- couldnot understand -PRON- -PRON- pant as -PRON- scramble to -PRON- place in -PRON- wait vehicle 
if be the count and be -PRON- then never mind that 
i cut in 
hang on prebble for be go to start on the hih speed 
very good captain 
the more peed the well 
i jerk the screen half through the slot and -PRON- shoot ahead like an arrow from a bow 
the machine be wrench in every part and i fear for a second that -PRON- would be rive to piece 
happily -PRON- fear be without foundation 
the car hold togetherand -PRON- fly onward like the wind a poor navigator captain call the professor 
this be -PRON- first experience withthis kind of a ship i call back to -PRON- 
what do -PRON- do 
try to look behind 
while i be about -PRON- the machine strike a high place in the road and the power be shut off 
-PRON- grunt a wonder i do not break -PRON- neck captain say -PRON- be stun for an instant 
when i sit up i hear -PRON- call but couldinot understand what -PRON- say 
the sight of that other car be enough though to remind -PRON- of what be go forward lose time when -PRON- have no time to lose 
-PRON- be under the heel of fortune and must put up with whatever come 
-PRON- should have shoot klimon 
have -PRON- do that -PRON- may have escape without have the official car take after -PRON- 
deal in such murderous fashion with even a chur be not in -PRON- 
nevertheless i could see now how -PRON- may have be well for -PRON- to put klimon out of the way 
watch the car behind professor 
i caution watch go on the chur be get ready to use -PRON- dpear 
what the professor have saidabout use the shotgun on klimon have give -PRON- an idea 
i be bide only the proper moment to put -PRON- into execution make short work of -PRON- captain shrill the professor if -PRON- overhaul -PRON- small doubt of that return letween -PRON- tooth can see the count eye flame like live coal 
this race be offer -PRON- a chance to even up old score 
and hell improve the opportunity if -PRON- can gain gaining whoop prebble -PRON- be useless for -PRON- to attempt to escape from the official car 
-PRON- have a threefoot cube of zellin equivalent to a draw power of seventytwa man 
-PRON- machine on the contrary be equip with only a block 
even allow for the add bulk and heavy load of the count car -PRON- be greatly outclass 
i open the screen to -PRON- wide and at time -PRON- seem hardly to touch the road so fast do -PRON- go 
be -PRON- hold -PRON- own prebble 
i cry still gain -PRON- answer 
there come a spear where do -PRON- strike 
ten foot behind -PRON- 
half a minute pass 
another spear chatter prebble six foot behind 
i mutter an exclamation 
the count have gain four foot in thirty second and something wotld have to be do at once prebble i shout come here and run the car canot -PRON- exclaim 
yes -PRON- can -PRON- will have to what be -PRON- go to do 
never mind 
time be too precious to waste tatk 
on hand and knee -PRON- creep to the forward point of the car and slip into the driver seat as i vacate -PRON- steer a boat 
i ask -PRON- lip to -PRON- ear 
-PRON- nod steer in the same way 
keep a firm grip on the helm or -PRON- will get a broken rib 
with this warning i creep back to the middle seat the shotgun in -PRON- hand 
the official car look like a sailless junk load to the gunwale with pirate 
shield and spear bristle in the sun and out of the center of the phalanx gleam the white face of count zylox gloomy and ominous 
stop -PRON- cry fiercely 
i pay no attention to the word but rivet -PRON- eye on the front of the official car 
two chur sit in the point one manage the steering lever and the other the screen 
at -PRON- foot between -PRON- be the large box hold the zellin cube 
a quick thought plunge through -PRON- brain 
i hesitate but a moment and then kneel on the broad seat i throw up the breech of thegun there be a cartridge each barrel 
throw the piece to -PRON- shoulder i take a long and careful aim at the zellin box 
a spear clove the air narrowly miss -PRON- head 
that be -PRON- signal to pull the trigger 
bang 
the recoil wrench -PRON- shoulder and nearly throw -PRON- from the seat 
when the smoke lift i see that i have work havoc enough 
that single charge have tear away the front and side of the zellin box cause trouble with the steering gear and prick the shin of the chur in the point the driver and the helmsman scare out of -PRON- wit have hurl -PRON- into the road 
the rest of -PRON- red companion follow -PRON- and flatten out along the ground leave only count zylox in the car 
what contortion that wonderful machine go through 
jerk ahead by a force as of seventytwo chur the broken helm thrashing in all divection -PRON- zigzag here and there jump aloft with wheel whir and finally crash into a tree at the roadside and lie a complete wreck count zylox i be glad to note have hurl -PRON- from the car before the final catastrophe and be suffer from nothing more than a few a a wail from the professor call -PRON- attention from the scene behind go -PRON- go go the screen cover 
i draw -PRON- from the box to get the entire force of the cube and the tiller jam sideways and knock -PRON- out of -PRON- hand 
i be angry for this carelessness of the professor be like to cost -PRON- dear -PRON- be not pursue -PRON- be true but -PRON- car be run away with -PRON- 
the only power -PRON- have over -PRON- be to guide -PRON- a little to right and leave 
-PRON- could not stop or diminish the speed 
-PRON- gait be that of the empire state express and the track before -PRON- have suddenly widen into all outdoors 
where -PRON- have leave the road i do not know but -PRON- be race across a broad plain hot sandy level as a floor 
there be no house no tree no rocksnothe to impede -PRON- progicss 
this be well consider -PRON- limited ability in handle the oyd car peer ahecad 
in ilie distance there rise from the earih a cloud like haze funnelshaped and resemble the swirl vortex of a cyclone 
what be -PRON- 
i have no time to debate the question even have i be so disposed 
the wall 
the wall shriek prebble 
yes there be the great wall build to hem in the chur 
-PRON- stretch across the plain as far as the eye could see and appear to encircle the column of smoke or dust or whatever -PRON- be 
as -PRON- charge toward -PRON- and -PRON- come plainer and plainer into view i conclude that -PRON- must be at least thirty foot in height of solid masonry pierce with one brazen gate toward which -PRON- be head 
the gate twenty foot wide and twenty high look forbid enough but well a colliston with that than with the granite wall 
port -PRON- helm prebble 
i shout 
port 
as -PRON- move the tiller i see a score of the red fiend silhouette on top of the wall 
-PRON- be look at -PRON- whoop dancing and beat -PRON- spear against -PRON- shield 
prebble begzin a paternostr but i cut -PRON- short with the remain barrel of the shotgun fire into the air 
the chur melt from the wall as if by magic 
-PRON- see 
i shout triumphantly 
this gun be go to do the business for -PRON- prebble 
that wall be go to do the business -PRON- fling back head for the gate 
i answer 
do -PRON- think -PRON- can smash open the gate and ride through the land of the chur straight to the pole -PRON- retort grimly 
make -PRON- peace with heaven sali be a smashup in less than a minute get to jump say as calmly as possible 
well to jump than have -PRON- life batter out against the gate 
while speak i throw out the bag of pemmican and ship biscuit 
the bag strike the ground spring twenty foot into the air and fall again in a shower of sand 
and -PRON- have get to go through that cry the professor not be a whole bone leave in -PRON- body 
jump 
i shout 
follow -PRON- 
out i go shotgun in hand 
when i come down i must have turn a dozen somersault 
the gun leave -PRON- hand and the talk re -PRON- head 
i rip -PRON- toga to rag and would have lose -PRON- utterly have not the cartridge belt hold -PRON- remnant about -PRON- waist 
after a second or two i realize that i be sit on the sand watch a figure fly upward from the point of the oyd car squirm through the air drop and ricochet along the ground halting at last a mere heap of humanity in a wrecked tunic 
be the professor dead or alive 
as i pick -PRON- up painfully to go forward and investigate a crashing sound reach -PRON- from the gate 
look toward that point i note with wonder that the barrier have not withstand the impact of the zellin cube 
the gate be ajar various piece of the oyd car pile in the opening 
prebble be on -PRON- foot before i reach -PRON- -PRON- still wear -PRON- buskin and be frantically engage in tie the remain of the tunic about -PRON- waist 
yes -PRON- cry angrily -PRON- would come north captain 
reason circumstance evervthe point south 
but no -PRON- would go north or nowhere 
and now look at -PRON- 
-PRON- pick up -PRON- talk ring and jam -PRON- down on -PRON- head 
-PRON- say something else but as -PRON- be talk nyll and i be listen in english the sense of -PRON- be lose upon -PRON- 
-PRON- be clear to -PRON- that -PRON- be not very seriously hurt and i go back for -PRON- own talk ring and the gun the professor be sorely out of patience with everybody and everything 
-PRON- have have two fall from the oyd car and the first one alone would have sour -PRON- temper but for the excitement attend the pursuit 
this second fall be far more dangerous and annoying than the first and i could not blame -PRON- for display some rancor to become of -PRON- sali the professo demand survey -PRON- as though -PRON- consider -PRON- salvation -PRON- part of the work cantell -PRON- better about that in a few minate i answer dizzy in brain and weak in the leg 
the only way i could hold -PRON- upright be by jeane on the shotgun 
if -PRON- isnot one thing -PRON- two scowl prebble 
how be -PRON- to get out of this wish i know 
-PRON- strike -PRON- though that the farther -PRON- can get away from that smash gate the well -PRON- will be for -PRON- 
come on prebble 
i reel to an about face and begin stagger off along the wall 
prebble shout an angry protest and i turn to discover that -PRON- have piumpe -PRON- down in the sand 
how do -PRON- think i can move -PRON- groan joint in -PRON- body be unhinge 
look where i light and -PRON- point to a gougedout spot in the earth 
no man could hit the ground like that without be half kill 
if -PRON- linger here until the chur come out say finish the job willing -PRON- declare resignedly have quantum sufficit 
be flesh and blood and not whalebone and india rubber -PRON- body tell -PRON- when i have bear hardship to the limit of endurance 
if -PRON- be bind to go on sali good by 
-PRON- be impossible for -PRON- to accompany -PRON- 
buck up answer wish i could but i canot 
here let -PRON- help -PRON- decline to be interfere with to stay righthere so that the chur can have a good chance at -PRON- 
why be -PRON- hang back 
why donot -PRON- show -PRON- 
i look toward the break gate 
the oyd car be heap fantastically in the middle of -PRON- but there be no sign of chur te be see 
the roar of the gun have frighten -PRON- i explain 
-PRON- couldnot frighten all the chur but only those who be on the wall 
where be the rest not theorize about the rest the present situation that concern -PRON- 
remember what happen at the lake when that revolver be fire 
those who hear the report drop pronc on -PRON- face but those who didnot hear the report refuse to be awe by the description the other cave of -PRON- 
there il be a smother of the hairy demon ail around -PRON- before long 
somie messenzer have revive and go after -PRON- 
the professor voice be hopeful appear to be honestly glad that -PRON- misadventurc be soon to be terminate 
-PRON- voice be strong and robust 
from that i gather that -PRON- be not so severely injure as -PRON- be try to make -PRON- believe 
let -PRON- lift -PRON- to -PRON- lcet professor i suggest and then i can support -PRON- while -PRON- make -PRON- escape 
-PRON- stare at -PRON- dblankly 
escape -PRON- echo 
why do -PRON- talk about such a thing 
where be -PRON- to escape to 
be there any haven of refuge in all this region for -PRON- and -PRON- 
if -PRON- go back the nyllite will catch -PRON- if -PRON- go forward then -PRON- fall into the hand of the chur not a spot in all this henighte country wherewe can call -PRON- safe 
-PRON- should have go south in the direction of the ice wall 
i see that i must reason with -PRON- companion and get -PRON- back into a normal state of mind 
tl adfnit professor say that -PRON- situation seem hopeless but have -PRON- not seem equally hopeless several time before this 
and havenot -PRON- always manage to slip through the gather danger get to be a first time captain when -PRON- fail to slip through -PRON- answer shake -PRON- head forebodingly 
personally i think -PRON- have come to that time have hope i go on take another tack that -PRON- would live to give to the world -PRON- proof regard the meteoric theory of the aurora 
possibly there be more glory in that for -PRON- than for -PRON- in discover the pole what i dislike about this chur business say -PRON- a flash 9f pride cross -PRON- dusty face proof -PRON- add fondly which scientific man can not dodge have to delieve -PRON- 
i intend to write a book that will place -PRON- name high on the scroll of fame 
-PRON- get up quite briskly while -PRON- be talk be absolutely certain that -PRON- word be the very last on this meteoric theory of the aurora 
from that ipse dixit there be no escape 
right -PRON- be 
i cry enthusiastically 
suppose -PRON- stroll off along the wall and see what -PRON- can discover 
-PRON- lean on -PRON- for a space while -PRON- adjust -PRON- glass ought to feel grateful to -PRON- captain -PRON- maunder for give -PRON- the chance to settle a question which have bother scientific mind for year 
i be grateful believe -PRON- 
how be -PRON- fele 
i ask solicitously 
well 
i be not so much of a wreck as have imagine 
there be no fracture naturally -PRON- dignitjr have suffer somewhat but -PRON- voice trail off into silence for just at that moment an army of chur have begin fairly to boil out of the gate in the wall 
these be not the one who have hear the terrifying report of the shotgun and drop from the wall a short time before but other undaunte and eager to fall upon -PRON- 
with fierce yell and spear clash against shield -PRON- literally swarm in -PRON- direction 
quick pant prebble 
the gunthe gun 
i throw up the breech and the empty shell be automatically eject 
then i pluck from the belt one of the few cartridge that have remain in -PRON- after -PRON- tumble from the car 
i press the shell to the breech 
the next moment -PRON- be possible i swear for i be a sailor and the provocation be great 
what falter prebble whisperingly what now 
i look at -PRON- with dilate eye 
these shell i reply hoarsely be too large 
i canot get -PRON- into the gun 
griffyn must have have two shotgunswe get the belt that go with the other weapoh 
the professor toss -PRON- arm and fall to the ground 
i stoe over -PRON- the muzzle of the gun in -PRON- hand sweep a circle about -PRON- with the stock 
i forget how many of those rabid chur i mow down with the clubbed firearm can only remember that -PRON- be take tie together with thong and drive beyond the great wall spear point prick -PRON- at every step 
prebble and 
i have be on tenterhook ever since -PRON- arrival in this circumpolar region but -PRON- have not face a more desperate situation than the one that now confront -PRON- 
personally i would not have give a copper cent for -PRON- chance 
-PRON- learned companion as be so often the case with -PRON- be lose in contemplation of -PRON- strange surrounding to the exclusion of the animal instinct of fear 
-PRON- mind be grapple with scientific datum and be therefore too busy to consider -PRON- peril here i hear -PRON- mutter -PRON- see the human faculty emerge through -PRON- chrysalis of brutality primordial obscure but very pronounce nevertheless 
how these head and these face would delight a lombroso 
there be no other savage in the world like these 
if i could abduct one of the creature and take -PRON- back to -PRON- own country what a stir would be cause the scientific world 
unless i be greatly mistaken professor i observe dryly -PRON- will have a splendid chance to study these interesting savage at close quarter hope so i do indeed -PRON- answer absently and be off again with -PRON- mumbling 
how do -PRON- live 
what do -PRON- eat 
be -PRON- monogamous 
do -PRON- have village 
that prognathous visage predicate cruelty and determination 
ah very absorbing very donot see anything in the nature of till field professor say -PRON- lift -PRON- bowed head and become suddenly aware that be march at -PRON- side 
no captain -PRON- return in an attempt to be sociable these savage be not agricultural 
in one way or another most savage be find to take a certain toll from mother earth and i presume that these chur must raise something in the nature of food even though none of -PRON- field be in evidence 
the art of the husbandman be very primitive in origin 
adnuration fill -PRON- face as -PRON- bend -PRON- gaze on a tall savage march just ahead of -PRON- 
what perfect physical development -PRON- exclaim can see little in these hairy scoundrel say i testily but vast power for evil -PRON- be mere brutesat the bottoin of the scale while the nyllite be at the top 
the nyllite symbolize the mind even as these chur be symbolical of the matter remark prebble 
the brilliant mentality of the nyll kingdom reach here for -PRON- physicaljpower take -PRON- by sheer force of the will humble -PRON- and shape -PRON- to various use 
where could -PRON- happen upon a finer commientary on the power of mind over matter 
-PRON- be get in too deep for -PRON- professor say warrant -PRON- however that if these hur only realize -PRON- power -PRON- could overrun the kingdom of yil and lie -PRON- waste 
the professor shudder 
what a catastrophe that would be -PRON- murmur 
think of the gorgeous palace the beautiful garden the wondrous invention and discovery of nyl all lie under the strangle hand of these brute 
such a calamity be too monstrous captain 
-PRON- could never happen 
what cause the downfall of the roman enipire 
i ask 
luxury effiminacy too much wealth and power 
all the empire become drunk with prosperity 
and as a result the roman eagle have -PRON- neck wrung and be cast to the vulture 
be i right -PRON- very tersely captain 
nyll strike -PRON- as be much in the same way 
-PRON- throw -PRON- a startled look 
at time captain say -PRON- -PRON- uncover a rich vein of thought that strike into profound depth yes -PRON- be right 
nyll base -PRON- power upon faculty of the mind that have be most astonishingly deveope if anything be to becloud those power the whole kingdom would be pillage by these brute who be now confine wlthln the great wall 
the possibility be terrible to contemplate and -PRON- quite unnerve -PRON- 
but nyllite be not exact replica of the ancient roman 
although a land of idleness the other kingdom be not lap in sensuous ease 
-PRON- experience with the nyllite have not be pleasant yet -PRON- must grant -PRON- -PRON- due 
i know personally that labor of the mind be more exhausting than labor of the body 
the professor be intensely interested in -PRON- captor 
without the wall -PRON- have be willing to bide in hdpelessness while the chur sally forth and dispatch -PRON- but now -PRON- be in another mood 
-PRON- realize i suppose say i grimly that -PRON- be prisoner these rope that bind -PRON- arm at -PRON- back -PRON- reply serve to remind -PRON- of that fact captain 
do -PRON- also realize that -PRON- may be doom to death 
that be quite possible -PRON- return gravely but i hope -PRON- will spare -PRON- long enough so that i may make some inquiry regard -PRON- mode of life 
an examination into -PRON- tribal custom -PRON- language the limitation of -PRON- intellect and -PRON- way of war would be highly divert -PRON- be but a step above the beast of the forest and may prove to be the trye miss ing link that unite man to the low order of creation 
if -PRON- could take one of -PRON- back with -PRON- captain 
-PRON- have no visible mean for get -PRON- away to -PRON- own country i break in so let -PRON- say nothing of burden -PRON- return with savage like these 
-PRON- see that i be out of sympathy with -PRON- aspiration and i see plainly that -PRON- be in a trancelike condition where -PRON- scientific knowledge be wrestle with recondite enigma to the complete exclusion of -PRON- present unhappy state 
i watch the chur stride swiftly along and force -PRON- to hurry in -PRON- midst 
-PRON- face reflect a purpose which be ominous and arouse disagreeable thought of what be to happen to the professor and -PRON- 
there be nothing to be do however except to submit passively and face the end with fortitude 
something may happen to make the end more pleasant than the present situation promise 
i see no building nothing in the way of shelter even of the rude description 
there be no evidence of art and craft beyond the shield and the spear 
these be wellmade wepon of offense and defense but suggest nothing more than war and savagery 
i lis tene to the professor discourse to -PRON- the facial angle retreat from the prognathous jaw to the low forehead prove these chur to be bestial 
-PRON- be cruel merciless superstitiousprimitive child as yet untouche by the faint ray of real knowledge 
thus -PRON- mumble scarcely heed the spear that accelerate -PRON- lag pace 
i also take notice of many thing but only in a perfunctory and general way 
for instance in pass through the gate i judge the wall of masonry to betwenty foot in thickness i see that the land of the chur be ridge with rocky hill for the most part barren i feel the earth to be uncomfortably warm under -PRON- foot and when -PRON- wade a small stream the water be hot to -PRON- flesh 
in the distance that column of cloudlike vapor trail skyward bending and twisting at the crest and spread out so that the sun resemble a fiery ball a drift shroud 
on and on -PRON- walk until -PRON- turn into a defile among the gaunt rock 
spear strike shield in a ring clamor and presto the bowlder spew out a perfect mob of unkempt creature who run toward -PRON- some erect andsome on all four 
woman and child drone prebble very curious very 
evidently these creature be cave dweller possibly survivor of the stone age and as such -PRON- progenitor 
i should like -PRON- measurement on the bertillon system 
the woman and child survey -PRON- in awe 
the professor however claim most of -PRON- attention -PRON- eye be focus on -PRON- head and spectaclesthe spectacle and buskin be about all that remain to -PRON- of -PRON- former state -PRON- be goad into a vilesmelling hole in the rocky hillside and be make to sit down while -PRON- fect be pinion 
then perfectly helpless -PRON- be leave to -PRON- own device 
one of the tall that -PRON- stand head and shoulder above the restbarke out a series of order 
immediately the creature seattere woman and child with the rest and begin fetch armful of dry wood and throw -PRON- down in a heap 
while thiswas go forward other chur arrive 
two carry the shotgun across -PRON- spear in front of -PRON- not dare to touch -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
four with spear elevate have -PRON- bag of pemmican and ship biscuit on the spear point 
that also i suppose be a fetich and to be handle warily 
lastly come a train of grizzle warrior each with a lose cartridge on the flat of -PRON- spear head these be throw in a heap beside the gun and bag of food in for -PRON- i mutter gloomily -PRON- think so prebble monosyllabic -PRON- answer absently 
what 
i query 
-PRON- give a start 
-PRON- speech captain be of the onesyilablfc variety that be rudimentary 
now the ancient aryan belay 
i interrupt out of temper want none of -PRON- homily now 
-PRON- have plenty of food for thought of a different kind 
yes yes -PRON- answer eagerly should call -PRON- homonymous or rather i lurch against -PRON- and bring -PRON- out of -PRON- vagary 
eh -PRON- exclaim 
do -PRON- say something captain look out there 
i answer brutally 
lord nyli say these creature be cannibal and -PRON- appear to be collect wood a chain of reason to claim -PRON- immediate attention 
-PRON- think the professor grow pallid donot think i answer know 
-PRON- press -PRON- clawlike hand together bind as -PRON- be 
a at last the professor be completely en rapport with -PRON- desperate situation 
the world will lose -PRON- demonstration of the meteoric theory -PRON- cry bitterly and -PRON- sali be the cause 
outside the wall -PRON- offer hope 
hope 
and look at -PRON- now 
upon -PRON- head sir will fall the consequence guess be both in for the consequence i return 
by the mizzentruck of the great harry 
i add look toward the wood gatherer a nyllite prisoner ask prebble 
no -PRON- act as though -PRON- have some authority among -PRON- 
strange mutter -PRON- companion -PRON- eye on the man 
-PRON- wear the skin of a wild beast like the chur and there be not the same intelligenceshown in -PRON- face as in the face of other of -PRON- race 
here come the tallman -PRON- s a chief i suppose 
the leader of the pack make toward the cave follow by four other ready for -PRON- i take -PRON- say try to speak calmly beg -PRON- pardon captain say prebble 
for what 
for accuse -PRON- of lead -PRON- into this predicament 
-PRON- have just flash over -PRON- that -PRON- could not have go south i -PRON- have want too think -PRON- would come to -PRON- i answer 
-PRON- will meet -PRON- fate shoulder to shoulder -PRON- go on not death that terrify -PRON- what follow in this case 
i lay -PRON- bound hand against -PRON- which be as near a handshake as -PRON- could come 
-PRON- differ often prebble and for -PRON- be two of diverse nature vet never doubt -PRON- innate manhood nor do i think -PRON- ever doubt mme 
there be something incongruous in remark just make when compare with other remark remember by -PRON- of which -PRON- have relieve -PRON- while -PRON- be on the ice cap but i have yetto find a man who be at all fime perfectly consistent 
surely no scientific man can lay claim to such an honor 
through the opening of -PRON- cave -PRON- watch the tall man and the four other 
suddenly the tall man come to a halt group the four around begin a harangue 
the guttural voice be pitch so low that -PRON- could not distinguish anything except husky syllable and staccato pause between -PRON- 
-PRON- be devise way and mean i suppose say the professor 
omne supposition be as good as another i answer 
-PRON- all come to one thing in the end be a bad dream an exceedingly disagreeable dream 
-PRON- still cling to that fiotion do -PRON- 
why not if -PRON- please -PRON- 
all life -PRON- dear captain be a dream 
at least so -PRON- fancy run 
an immortal fall asleep in elysium and what -PRON- dream be a human life 
sometimes -PRON- dream be short and sometimes long sometimes -PRON- be sad and bitter and sometimes full of happiness and hope realize 
but the immortal wake whether -PRON- dream be bright or dull and again -PRON- discover -PRON- in elysium and -PRON- realize that -PRON- have be in elysium all the time 
with -PRON- eye on the gabbling chur i give rather deep attention to this odd conceit of i have never suspect that -PRON- have a vein of poetry in -PRON- makeup 
very pretty say and what be dbetter and more to the point there may be a little truth in -PRON- 
but elysium must be full of sleeper 
-PRON- mutter a few word under -PRON- breath and i fear -PRON- be tinker up another equation 
but no 
presently -PRON- lift -PRON- head remove -PRON- spectacle and begin clean -PRON- on a rag of -PRON- tunic 
at that moment the chief come on with -PRON- four chur and the professor come to a pause 
the chur chieftain unbound -PRON- ankle and motion to -PRON- to rise 
-PRON- obey and walk out among the ragged rabble that surround the pyre there -PRON- be cut asunder and the professor be lead aside and make to seat -PRON- on a bearskin 
after this the nyllite step in front of -PRON- 
-PRON- be from nyll -PRON- ask 
recentiy i answer 
where from originally 
there be no blackhaired man in nyll and no hairless man like the one yonder 
-PRON- turn and indicate prebble 
-PRON- come from beyond the ice wall 
who be -PRON- if i may inquire 
sertez i be call 
banish from nyll by king boazar on the morning of the long day 
banish -PRON- add acrimoniously because i dare to make love to the princess ylma 
-PRON- strike a note that make -PRON- hearstring vibgate 
i eye -PRON- keenly 
princess ylma would notreceive -PRON- advance i query 
no -PRON- answer be nothing 
-PRON- do not know -PRON- own mind 
apart from that however -PRON- be promise to a man -PRON- hate 
who 
to count zylox captain of the king guard at last i know why -PRON- lordship feel pity for princess ylma 
why will the king force -PRON- to marriage agajnsther will 
i proceed feign carelessness 
because zylox be head of the house of almik rival of the boazar 
on -PRON- death the king fear ylma will be set aside in favor of zylox and -PRON- wish to unite the two house 
sertez turn and shake -PRON- clench fist southward bide -PRON- time -PRON- hiss 
some day i shall lead a horde of chur into nyll and steal theprincess 
the next moment -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder and toss -PRON- hand deprecatingly 
but enough of this suppose -PRON- know the fate for which -PRON- be intend can imagine what -PRON- be to be 
have -PRON- any power among these people 
can -PRON- not persuade -PRON- to give over -PRON- horrible design 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- companion will be spare say -PRON- 
-PRON- be taboo among the chur because of -PRON- hairless head 
-PRON- can none of -PRON- understand the what -PRON- can not understand -PRON- believe to be supernatural 
i laugh bitterly at the inconsistency of the chur 
the professor would live 
-PRON- may never be able to return to -PRON- own country but -PRON- bald pate save -PRON- from thie disaster that threaten -PRON- 
i be near the shotgun the small heap of cartridge and the food bag 
-PRON- despondent eye fall upon -PRON- and i notice something small in -PRON- but of great importance just then 
the cartridge differ in size 
have there be two size of loaded shell in the belt 
and have in -PRON- haste at the great wall pluck out one of the large shell will ask -PRON- say i to the nyllite to take this cord from -PRON- wrist 
-PRON- can not escape say -PRON- 
therefore the less reason for -PRON- to hesitate in grant -PRON- request 
-PRON- remove the bond 
instantly i pick up the shotgun throw up the breech and try one of the small shell 
i tremble even now to think of that agonizing moment 
would -PRON- fit or have i try the small kind just without the wall 
the shell slide into the barrel and i snap the breech back into place 
glory shout prebble leap to -PRON- foot and wave frantically the bearskin on which -PRON- have be sit 
-PRON- perform a dance bizarre enough consider -PRON- regalia 
the chur think i be about to make some attempt at escape begin close in on -PRON- with savage cry and ferocious gesture 
i fire the single barrel into the air and stand quietly under the smoke wreath note the effect 
the result be all that i have dare to hope 
down go the chur even sertez sink to one knee 
silence follow disturb only by the gabbling old professor who not know -PRON- bald head have save -PRON- believe the gun have prove the salvation of both of -PRON- 
presently the chief get up on -PRON- hand and knee crawl to -PRON- foot and lift a handful of sand and throw -PRON- over -PRON- head 
then -PRON- rise and yelp at the rest of -PRON- hairy follower 
immediately a long line of the creature begin creep past -PRON- every one of -PRON- perform the same operation 
what be the meaning of this sertez -PRON- in quire 
as long as -PRON- remain on earth thunder maker return fulsomely -PRON- and -PRON- companionare the honor guest of the pack 
koz the chieftain tender -PRON- abject apology for the manner in which -PRON- have be treat 
those on the wall prior to the breaking of the gate aver stoutly that -PRON- be the thunder maker but koz would not believe 
now that -PRON- hae hear with -PRON- own ear and seenwith -PRON- own eye -PRON- declare that heand -PRON- pack will be -PRON- slave umtil -PRON- depart from the land 
tis well i answer with dighity 
tell koz that -PRON- be put out somiewhat at themanner of -PRON- reception but that -PRON- harbor noill will 
-PRON- shall be inform also wish -PRON- to tell -PRON- i continue i and -PRON- companion be merely human like the nyliite 
but -PRON- have power to requite evil for evil andgood for good 
there be no such word as good in the chur language 
then repeat the substance of -PRON- remark in way 
chief koz leader of the pack seem overjoyed when -PRON- word be translate by sertez for -PRON- benefit 
from condemn stranger -PRON- rise at one leap to the rank of honored guest 
the good cave in the hill be place at -PRON- two of the chief son be tell off to serve -PRON- 
one of -PRON- first act be to send for the bag of pemgnican and biscuit and to fortify -PRON- with ahearty meal against other emergency which -PRON- know would be sure to arise 
soon after -PRON- have finish -PRON- meal sertez look in on -PRON- for a little chat 
prebble and i have just be discuss sertez 
-PRON- be by -PRON- own admission a banished man but i regard -PRON- in the light of a renegade 
-PRON- have say princess ylma do not like himfor which i commend -PRON- warmlyand that in the face of this -PRON- be -PRON- desire to abduct -PRON- 
no gentleman would express -PRON- in such a manner 
prebble be of one mind with -PRON- but advise that -PRON- tolerate the fellow because of -PRON- value to -PRON- in -PRON- dealing with the chur 
so when sertez creep through the low entrance into -PRON- cave and then get up and advanced into the glare of the torch that light the interior -PRON- welcome -PRON- civilly 
-PRON- remark upon the head room to be have in -PRON- quarter say -PRON- be the only cave in the district where a man could stand upright without fear of knock out -PRON- brain 
-PRON- loll on a bearskin and -PRON- present -PRON- with a bit of pemmican and a ship biscuit both of which -PRON- appear to relish should think say that if the chur can climb to the top of the great wall on one side -PRON- could drop over on the other 
so -PRON- could -PRON- answer but there be no need of any climbing 
-PRON- gentleman have demolish the gate and -PRON- be now possible to walk through with perfect ease 
then why donot -PRON- do -PRON- strike in prebble 
from the little i have see of both country nyll be far preferable to this 
the chur be cow by the superiority of the nyllite say sertez 
with one look a nyllite can make a chur drop -PRON- spear and run howl back to -PRON- wilderness can -PRON- ever hope to make a raid into the other country i ask have be wait for king doazar and the almiks to come to dagger draw 
but now i have another plan 
i propose to cooperate with -PRON- 
in what way 
-PRON- seem to be possess of wonderful pow ers sertez proceed audaciously and if -PRON- could by some mean the nyllite the chur would immediately overrun -PRON- country and i could get the princess 
the shotgun be within reach i put out -PRON- hand toward -PRON- 
prebble halt -PRON- with a look 
that be out of -PRON- power say -PRON- 
disappointment overspread thie villainousface of sertez 
there be no way -PRON- can help -PRON- -PRON- query 
no i reply shortly 
what be the extent of the chur possessiotis ask the professor at -PRON- old tradeof delve for fact 
twenty mile fromwall to wall 
and what cause that pillar of smoke which -PRON- see to the north 
sertez look surprised suppose everybody know that say -PRON- 
the earth grind around -PRON- great spindle cause much heat so that smoke and minute particle of dust arise and mingle with the clowds 
tlie professor grab at -PRON- head 
adter a moment -PRON- continue what be the diameter of the north pole a geographical mile 
round on top 
no flatflat as a floor 
the great ziff live there 
who under the canopy be the great ziff 
i demand 
again the surprised lock filter across face 
-PRON- ignorance astonish -PRON- -PRON- exclaim 
the great ziff gentleman be head chief of all the pack 
when the time come to raid the land of the nyllite -PRON- will head the pack in person 
-PRON- be a warrior of prowess 
-PRON- be invincible in combat a veritable lion 
but the eye of the nyllite be too much for -PRON- as for the rest of -PRON- follower 
there be some peculiar thing ahout the great ziff for instance -PRON- be not subject to the gentleman 
fe have live many thousand influenice of time of vear and will no doubt last as long as the earth endure 
i see a grin form about the professor thin lip 
how do -PRON- account for thiserremarka ble longevity very easily 
what make timer 
day of course the succession of light and darkness 
what make day 
the rotation of the earth on -PRON- axis 
the great ziff live on the end of the axis and doesnot rotate 
therefore -PRON- be not subject to the influence of time 
the professor reach for the gun this time but i grab jt from -PRON- 
sophistry -PRON- cry rotation of the earth as -PRON- sdy make what -PRON- call a day but neither day nor month nor year make time 
-PRON- be but way station on the eternal path 
when -PRON- have be long in the country -PRON- will know more about -PRON- be unruffle rejoinder 
prebble grow red in the face and only succeed in calm -PRON- after a great effort 
how far be the north pole from here 
i ask 
an hour journey be anxious to pay -PRON- respect to the great zi impossible 
why impossible 
at a distance of fifty foot from the pole the terrific heat would scorch -PRON- to a cinder 
how do the great ziff get on and off the pole rarely get off 
as for get on -PRON- be there when the earth begin to rotate 
nonsense whoop the professor 
the longer -PRON- stay the more -PRON- will kuow say sertez laconically 
if the great ziff lead -PRON- subject on -PRON- raid into the land of nyll i put in have to get off the pole wonot -PRON- 
-PRON- will answer sertez 
when ready hell come fire have no effect on -PRON- and that be another of -PRON- peculiarity 
-PRON- be say -PRON- be very fond of blue fire 
-PRON- be serve by little boy in red cap what folly be the man talk exclaim the disgusted professor 
and by monster all head and no tail continue sertez and by hideous slimy thing that creep on the earth and slide through the air and order prebble 
-PRON- have enough of that after fact not fancy 
the longer -PRON- be with -PRON- the more yes yes -PRON- say that before 
the chur believe these thing about the great ziff 
about what i would expect of -PRON- primitive mind sniff the professor run to physical rather than to mental power say sertez rise 
if i can be of assistance to -PRON- at any time gentleman -PRON- add not fail to call on -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- crawl out on all four as -PRON- have crawl in 
there go the big begin the pro fessor but pause abruptly 
no -PRON- go on wonot say -PRON- 
what -PRON- tell be hardly more in credible than the thing -PRON- have see with -PRON- own ecye since reach these circumpolar re gion if -PRON- be to put -PRON- experience down in black and white for the benefit of -PRON- fellow countryman captain -PRON- would call -PRON- monumental reirain again 
the term grate on a sensitive ear 
truth be strange than fiction ever dare to be say i sagely 
a few minute later accompany by -PRON- servitor bigoll and xit -PRON- emerge from -PRON- cavern and start for the pole 
-PRON- den open on a rocky defile with steep side which -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to traverse 
at the end of the defile -PRON- come upon a group of warrior who grin behind -PRON- couch spear dispute -PRON- advance 
i motion -PRON- aside but -PRON- would not stir around for sertez thinking to make -PRON- wish know through -PRON- 
-PRON- be not in sight however 
as a last resort i fire the gun 
the chur quake in -PRON- track but do not fall as have heretofore be -PRON- invariable custom tr the other end of the defile say the professor 
-PRON- do and be meet by more of the chur who blockade -PRON- as effectuauy as the other have do -PRON- be honor guest with a vengeance i fume do this mean anyway 
-PRON- mean reply the professor that -PRON- prize -PRON- company so highly -PRON- canot let -PRON- go 
-PRON- must return to the cave 
this -PRON- do and for one hundred and sixtyeight hourswhich would have be seven day in a country where night and day recur in accept orderwe sleep eat converse and make essay to begin -PRON- journey poleward 
but -PRON- be unable to leave the defile the outlook be discourage 
sertez keep -PRON- in the background the whole time and whenever -PRON- question bigoll and xit by sign to tell -PRON- about -PRON- -PRON- shake -PRON- head and grin blankly 
finally in the hundred and sixtyeighth hour sertez materialize 
-PRON- bring with -PRON- a silver box 
-PRON- tell -PRON- to call on -PRON- say with some heat whenever -PRON- desire -PRON- service be here gentleman -PRON- answer blandly where have -PRON- peen 
abroad in the land of the 
chur organize and prepare for the coming of the great ziff 
i notice that -PRON- be highly pleased over something and repress -PRON- jubilant teeling with dituculey on foot 
i ask messenger one of the chur have come from the land of boazar 
-PRON- say the blight have fall and that the mental power of the nyllite be dethrone 
-PRON- have become gibber idiot dodder fool 
and now now the accept time approach 
-PRON- do not believe in the great ziff 
but -PRON- shall see -PRON- come in a cloud of blue fire with the little boy in red cap and monster all head and no tail and hideous thing that creep on earth and slide through air 
-PRON- shall witness the gathering of the pack under the great ziff and then if -PRON- follow -PRON- shall observe the overthrow of the nyllite and behold sertez and princess ylma united and hold sway under protection of the high chief of the chur 
-PRON- draw a picture which horrify -PRON- 
for the moment prebble be dumb 
sertez laugh diabolically and hand -PRON- the silver box and a little golden kel for -PRON- say -PRON- the messenger bring -PRON- 
-PRON- say -PRON- be for the stranger with the black hair and eye be all agog with curiosity 
and so be prebble for that matter 
both -PRON- and sertez watch eagerly while unlocked the casket and throw back the lid gorr plate with the royal arm exclaim the astonished sertez 
carnelian -PRON- add 
the plate be from a woman 
in the box be a square thin block of a fleshre color

how do -PRON- contrive to learn the secret of the plate 
i ask will show -PRON- 
-PRON- reach for the carnelian block but i thrust -PRON- behind -PRON- 
this be mine i believe -PRON- say i remark very well -PRON- simper but i detect a flash of -PRON- eye which make -PRON- distrustful 
try for -PRON- and -PRON- learn nothing 
-PRON- be not educate up to -PRON- 
take the plate between -PRON- palm so 
-PRON- hold -PRON- palm close togethet illustrate how i be to hold the thirfg 
i do as direct 
a delightful sensation the very poetry of exquisite feeling speed along -PRON- nerve and center in -PRON- brain apart from this however no tangible think impress -PRON- on -PRON- mind 
what mystery be lock in the plate burn to know yet dread use the only channel lie open to -PRON- 
sertez be a vilai 
still -PRON- be a nyllite and have be bring up on gorr plate so to speak 
-PRON- imnatience tn receive the message overcaame -PRON- repugnance of the mean 
i hand the royal block to the renegade 
tell -PRON- what -PRON- say i request 
a gleam of satisfaction dart through -PRON- blue eye 
i kmew i be play into -PRON- hand but i also know there be nothing else for -PRON- 
-PRON- sink on a bearskin the plate between -PRON- palm 
bend -PRON- head -PRON- begin in a low voice the thought of ylma princess of nyll daughter of boazar concern momentous event takmg place in the kingdom and coacernmg the blackhaired blackeye stranger from beyond the ice wall who be often in -PRON- mind and atway abide in -PRON- heart 
i be for snatch the plate from this renegade -PRON- rival but what -PRON- have say only make -PRON- wildly eager for more 
i could learn more through -PRON- alone so i suffer -PRON- to proceed wondrous and unheardof thing be in the land of nyllite and i be fill with fearful foreboding 
the other stranger comljure from the sky by the hairless prophet be condemn to death by oyd but save -PRON- by offer to deliver to the king and -PRON- people thousand of keese of the elixir introduce by the little prophet with the glass eye 
whereto the foreigner last to arrive have rearet a strange structure fill with wonderful vat and call by -PRON- a distillery 
into this structure maize be carry and from -PRON- keese upon keese of the elixir be take to the end that the whole kingdom may renew -PRON- youth 
but if youth must be renew at such a price -PRON- be -PRON- prayer that the all wise will suffer -PRON- to age quickly and die that i may nolonger witness the orgy of these -PRON- people 
the king -PRON- father lie constantly in a state of torpor the gentleman in wait sing song and hold wassail from hour to hour the minister have lackluster eye and mumble to -PRON- and the business of state be at a standstill 
the people be even as the chur dull besotte reel along the road shout rave fill the air with hideous sound 
-PRON- have become heast and worsethan beast 
princess ylma cry aloud in -PRON- despair to the hblackeye stranger from the land beyond the ice wall 
will -PRON- come to the rescue of the hyperborean save this distressed people and gain the cternal gratitude of -PRON- unhappy ylma 
something tell -PRON- -PRON- will not ignore this prayer and that i be as much in -PRON- heart as -PRON- be in mine 
the voice of sertez cease 
while speak -PRON- tone have become soft and gentle as though -PRON- appropriate for -PRON- the thought of the carnelian block 
then abruptly -PRON- leap erect with flame fling the gorr plate at -PRON- foot 
in a voice husky with anger -PRON- cry -PRON- blackhaire interloper from the antipode dare to raise -PRON- eye to the princess ylma 
-PRON- have the unblushing audacity to rival one of -PRON- own race 
liscreant 
renegade cry i hotly 
captain captain implore prebble observe -PRON- clench fist be calm calm i cry calm when this banish scoundrel speak to -PRON- in the manner -PRON- do 
by the mizzentruck of the great harry -PRON- s the bad enemy king boazar have do -PRON- frst stroke of work for princess ylma attend to this beggar so -PRON- pretty plan for raid the country will fall through 
prebble step in front of -PRON- 
enough of this captain say -PRON- 
remove -PRON- talk ring so that -PRON- may converse without let sertez understand -PRON- word 
i remove the ring and string -PRON- on -PRON- arm meanwhile keep wary and wrathful eye on the renegade 
i will say for -PRON- that -PRON- hold -PRON- ground with great firmness give every indication of be a knave of unusual quality to find together 
now go on prebble -PRON- own ring in -PRON- hand let -PRON- tell -PRON- captain that -PRON- be unwise to arouse sertez against -PRON- 
-PRON- safety among the chur be problematical 
-PRON- be alive by grace of -PRON- being esteem the thunder maker but the remegade have power with the chur and may at any moment withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- favor 
-PRON- can not afford to take chance 
the scoundrel have design upon the princess ylma 
i flare 
prebble look at -PRON- keenly 
have -PRON- any design on the princess captain -PRON- ask bluntly 
l be a man of honor say draw up to -PRON- full height and that question be lead and highly personal 
be sensible captain beg prebble be i not 
i growl glowering into the saturnine face of sertez 
-PRON- be not if -PRON- contemplate an alliance by marriage with the princess 
-PRON- be not of vour people and -PRON- be of the royal family 
such a union would be a misalliance and result in disaster 
believe -PRON- sali 
-PRON- be a beautiful girl and as goed as -PRON- be beautiful i answer 
and -PRON- have see -PRON- twice and talk with -PRON- not at all 
much -PRON- know about -PRON- captain be an explorer prebble but that do not deny some small amount of sentiment in -PRON- soul 
strangle this bit of sentiment 
-PRON- have warp -PRON- judgment 
continue to harbor -PRON- and -PRON- will suffer 
suffer i echo angrily 
yes suffer 
suppose -PRON- could get away from this part of the earth and return to other part -PRON- know well 
would -PRON- take princess ylma with -PRON- 
as mrs salis yesif -PRON- would go 
what would happen to the throne in that event 
when the time come for boazar to die with princess ylma go the kingdom wauld fall into the hand of sertez 
could there be a great disaster and if yima be -PRON- would fall into the hand of sertez 
that prebble be an infinitely great disaster 
-PRON- smile 
-PRON- look at the princess through the small end of the telescope captain say -PRON- and at the kingdom through the big end 
as a conseguence the importance of the princess be magnify out of all proportion 
there be no use argue with -PRON- prebble i storm know -PRON- heart man and i will go -PRON- own way 
as for this scoundrel sertez will save nyll from -PRON- lawless intention 
when i be do with -PRON- there will be no chance of the kingdom or of the princess ever talle into -PRON- unworthy hand 
i consider -PRON- duty to put sertez out of the way and all this mutter prebble because of the think wave imbed in one gorr plate 
be -PRON- all mad 
call -PRON- what -PRON- will -PRON- mind be make up 
yima have call upon -PRON- to save -PRON- father kingdom 
pollock have release an evil which have -PRON- inception with -PRON- -PRON- be at fault and the least -PRON- can do be to pay heed to the cry send -PRON- by the princess in that carnelian block 
listen counsel the professor 
there be a possibility that sertez do not translate the think wave of the princess correctly 
no possibility of that at all 
-PRON- want to learn what thought the princess be send to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have repeat to -PRON- a message which be not in the plate 
prebble the message prove -PRON- to be correct no sidestep all that about pollock the dlstlllel son flooding nyll with that tt have happen and all th confound elixir rest have happen just as sertez tell -PRON- 
the sentiment of the princess be correctly translate and lie -PRON- life on -PRON- 
that gorr plate be a call to actiona commandand -PRON- can not ignore -PRON- be as eager for action as -PRON- be captain say prebble but what can -PRON- do if -PRON- tie -PRON- hand by antagonize sertez 
-PRON- be already antagonize 
in -PRON- -PRON- recognize a rival and that be more than enough to set -PRON- against the two of -PRON- 
stand aside 
i tell -PRON- professor i be determined to see this through to the bitter end 
-PRON- must strike a blow for nyll 
-PRON- be subordinate the welfare of nyll to that of the princess 
if -PRON- slay sertez captain every chur will be at -PRON- throat 
reecf please on that phase of the matter have reflect and i tell -PRON- there be no time to lose 
over the professor shoulder be the evil leer face of the renegade taunt -PRON- and give -PRON- a dare to do -PRON- bad 
in order to stop the professor argument clap on the talk ring then i start by a detour for sertez 
prebble seek to hold -PRON- but i shake -PRON- off 
the next moment i hurl -PRON- at the renegade 
-PRON- be slender and quick of movement and manage to avoid -PRON- 
duck under -PRON- fist -PRON- race for the entrance to the cave pick up the gun and cartridge belt as -PRON- flee 
there -PRON- go scream prebble steal -PRON- thunder let -PRON- steal -PRON- thunder captain 
i try -PRON- good to overhaul the rascal but -PRON- claw through the opening a dozen foot in the lead 
down i go on -PRON- marrow bone to follow andthen just as i be close to the exit there come a crash and the light of day be shut 
rom -PRON- eye 
ahuge bowlder which have be keep in readiness as afterward learn be knock free and fall across the entrance 
prebble and be imprison in the cave 
imprison and render helpless when -PRON- be need elsewhere 
for -PRON- sole wish now be to get back to the prince and save -PRON- and -PRON- people from the doom that threaten -PRON- 
i could have imitate the army in flander -PRON- be possible i do although the memory escape -PRON- 
what be that harp the queruious voice of the professor bowlder block the entrance answer 
push -PRON- aside 
i have try without avail locomotive couldnot move -PRON- pant -PRON- squeeze around the edg 
the opening be hermetically seal 
that scoundrel design this for a live grave i creep back to the torch beside which -PRON- companion crouch wring -PRON- hand 
think of i say in a hollow voice 
what noble mind be there oerthrown 
captain reply prebble in an awesome whisper -PRON- be the demon refer to in the legend 
aye return -PRON- save -PRON- miserable life with a flask of bourbon and pollock the distiller son have complete the work 
-PRON- have build a gin mill and the kingdom of boazar be steep in debauchery 
the serpent have crawl into paradise 
and the princess ylma 
merciful heaven what will become of -PRON- i stagger erect and beat -PRON- brow with -PRON- clench fist 
the opportunity of the chur have arrive say prebble still in -PRON- awed whisper 
lead by the great ziff the ally pack will sweep through the broken gate and lie domain in waste 
awful captain 
-PRON- soul shrink at the thought 
and that arch fiend sertez will bear away the princess yima 
i rave must get out of here 
-PRON- must i tell -PRON- 
i crawl to the rock again and push until i see star 
not an inch could i move -PRON- 
come back captain call prebble calmly waste -PRON- strength 
come back and let -PRON- think 
can -PRON- think -PRON- out of this hole in the hillside 
i retort be what -PRON- want think must precede action 
come here and be quiet 
there be a command in -PRON- voice and i crawl back to the torch once more and crouch opposite -PRON- watch -PRON- fac in the sickly glare 
-PRON- be a thin strong face the face of a thinker 
-PRON- eye gleam and glow as -PRON- cogitate 
i be in the mood for quick and decisive action and the necessity of inaction gall and fret -PRON- 
first say the professor -PRON- must calm -PRON- 
a passive brain evolve the most fruitful suggestion 
this be not the first time -PRON- have ask -PRON- to be calm i return 
if -PRON- feeling be yours prebble -PRON- would understand the uselessness of the request be as much concerned as -PRON- be captain over the trouble that menace nyll 
sertez the renegade seem destine to have -PRON- day 
if boazar die and the kingdom fall into the hand of sertez 
-PRON- have already speak of that prebble i mterrupte if boazar die and if princess yima do not reign as queen regal authority fail into the hand of count zylox 
-PRON- be tell vou remember that zvlox be the head of another branch of the roval family 
-PRON- be the pretender 
-PRON- have not grasp ny mean captain sertez for -PRON- reward in helpmd the great ziff aoamst -PRON- own people will be give the hand of yhna in marriage 
thus -PRON- will be the queen consort and undoubtedly elevate to a high place in the wreck adfter the great ziff get through with nyll i answer in a hollow tone there will be noth leit to rule 
thc chur will occupy the fertile plain of nyll and will overrun and desecrate the palace and the templea ev enthmcf worth while will be trmlp lead underfoot and destrove and the conquer brute will brutalize everything good and noble with which -PRON- come in contact 
in time however the nyllite will shake o7 tie vstupor recover thetr brilliant mental power and reconquer -PRON- kingdom 
-PRON- may require year perhaps decade but that result il be evolve ultimately out of the wreck 
nyl will have learn a lesson and can rebuild ijts glory on a firm foundation not forget professor i remind -PRON- that -PRON- present business be to escape from this cavern 
-PRON- be need and -PRON- must not del lay or waste -PRON- time in idle talk 
the talk be not idle captain reply prebble 
-PRON- wit be at work upon this problem and discourse merely sharpen -PRON- 
i have no hkmg for this sertez from the first be -PRON- response but -PRON- find -PRON- of one mind on that point very soon after -PRON- fall into the hand of the chur in what way do -PRON- think -PRON- can effect -PRON- escape from this hole in the hillside an idea have not yet offer -PRON- captain but i have an instinctive feeling that i be close to of the problem 
let the talk go on flow i shall suddenly see the light 
here be another inconsistency of at time while -PRON- be busy with hi prollem -PRON- want to be alone and would bear with nothing that may distract -PRON- here at this time -PRON- be eager for conversation and declare -PRON- an aid to quick and effective thinking 
as -PRON- mind be entirely wrap up in the princess and the sorry plight of -PRON- father and -PRON- kingdom i be at a loss to put forward any subject for discourse 
the professor step into the breach 
what do -PRON- think of the great ziff -PRON- inquire 
why that -PRON- be a great fake be a myth professor and the myth have be develop as a sort of check on the wild chur 
the professor shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be no myth -PRON- declare 
-PRON- be a symbol indeed but a live symbol 
there be a vast amount of folk lore and tradition surround the great ziff but the person -PRON- be a reality 
-PRON- be the real king of the chur and -PRON- keep -PRON- hidden because -PRON- know that will bind -PRON- authority more closely around -PRON- savage subject 
why all that tommyrot about the little boy in red ap and monster all head and no tail and soon 
when 
sertez vwa talk to -PRON- alout those thing -PRON- -PRON- halt -PRON- and ask for fact not fancy 
the fancy as i now believe captain symbotize fact beyond -PRON- depth i observe helplesly 
i see in the story about the great ziff nothing but fatry taleschronicle of the cid and aljce in wonderland 
surely -PRON- donot agree with the chur that time have no effect upon the ziff and that -PRON- have live alwaysand wili always live belteve the fact which that statement symbolize assert prebble 
since man inhabit the earth the idea for which the ziff stand have be in the background immutable eternal 
but what be that idea 
prebble stare at -PRON- 
there be sentiment in -PRON- soul captain and surely -PRON- wit should be able to match -PRON- against the nimble fancy of a lot old hairy demon like these chur a puzzle which i have no time to work on at present must do something prebble and at once -PRON- think of any way out of here be close to something captain 
-PRON- eye for several moment have be fix on the torch flame 
that say -PRON- point to the flare offer the suggestion that may lead -PRON- to freedom 
how open -PRON- say be hermetically seal yes 
nou be sure 
dositive what cause that flame to bend toward the rear of the cavern 
there be a draft and there could be no draft without an opening right 
i cry overjoyed 
there be an exit somewhere 
-PRON- pull the torch from -PRON- socket 
hold -PRON- in -PRON- hand -PRON- walk slowly toward the back part of the cavern watch the flame as -PRON- bend forward direct -PRON- with flicker finger 
the roof dip toward the floor 
prebble go down on hand and knee still holdine the torch and followi e as -PRON- commandel -PRON- trail away and i see -PRON- weave to and fro in the distance the fluttering torch like astar 
-PRON- be a star -PRON- star of hope if ever -PRON- have one 
suddenly the little reddish dot come to a standstill and voice float back to -PRON- eureka -PRON- call 
bring what s leave of the biscuit and pemmican captain 
i snatch up the bagit be now light and of small dimensionsand follow -PRON- companion 
-PRON- wait for -PRON- have a tight squeeze of -PRON- say -PRON- 
when the great primordial cataclysm fashion this hill -PRON- have the forethought to leave a narrow passage through from the cavern to the top 
i can see daylight ahead 
crawl for -PRON- i return be close after -PRON- 
in some way i push and drag -PRON- through and at last -PRON- emerge on the hillside overlook the defile that lie at -PRON- cavern mouth 
from -PRON- position -PRON- could look down and see the great bowlder that have be balance over the entrance 
the gully be full of chur and the center of interest seem to be sertez 
the renegade have the gun and be handle -PRON- with dangerous carelessness 
if -PRON- s not careful say kill somebody 
the word be barely out of -PRON- mouth when the piece explode and one of the chur fall in -PRON- track 
consternation seize upon every one sertez along with the rest 
the destructive power of the gun have not before be bring home to these creature for the mere report of -PRON- have be sufficient to compass -PRON- end 
now however the bunghng of sertez have work a catastrophe which cause the thunder maker to be doubly fear 
the chur prostrate -PRON- and sertez drop the firearma though -PRON- have be a serpent fling the belt down upon -PRON- and then retreat to a respeetful distance 
this be -PRON- opportunity professor say and -PRON- hurry down the slope and make -PRON- way to where the gun and belt be lie 
-PRON- would be difficult to decide whether -PRON- appearance in the defile have apparently issue through the solid bowlder block -PRON- cave or the fatal use of the shotgun frighten these iavaze creature the more on several occasion i have see -PRON- primitive mind overcome but never to the extent that -PRON- be now be -PRON- able to get out of the cave falter sertez 
-PRON- be not mecessary for -PRON- to know say i sternly pick up the belt and buckle -PRON- around -PRON- and then possess -PRON- of the gun 
inform koz that -PRON- desire to go to the pole and interview the great ziff 
but -PRON- can not do as i tell -PRON- 
i break in sternly and emphasize the command by point the gun in -PRON- direction 
-PRON- give a shout of horror and run to the chief 
koz listen attentively while sertez tell -PRON- wish and then approach -PRON- with -PRON- two servitor bigollrand xit 
sertez do not venture in -PRON- proximity 
krom a distance -PRON- call koz and -PRON- son will accompany -PRON- 
see to -PRON- sertez shout -PRON- head no foray into the kingdom of nyll otherwise the thunder maker shall speak in term -PRON- eannot fail to understand 
-PRON- show -PRON- tooth in a snarling smile and from that i know that -PRON- be not yet do with -PRON- 
koz -PRON- take the food bag and carry -PRON- aerdss -PRON- shoulder but neither -PRON- nor bigoll nor xit could be induce to bear the thunder maker 
with the three chur in the lead -PRON- course lead -PRON- down the defile and out throtigh a country where titan have at one time be at play hurl mountain at each other pile -PRON- up fantastically 
steadily but surely -PRON- advance upon the pillar of smoke and dust 
as -PRON- go on the ground grow hotter beneath -PRON- 
often -PRON- strike a spot where -PRON- foot be compel to fly upward in a wild dance or bear the weight of -PRON- body on -PRON- toe 
everywhere be desolation 
contiguous to the great wall be area where plant and tree grow and stream of warm water have -PRON- course 
but here the heat be fatal to plant life and what moisture the ground contain be give off insteam 
still onward -PRON- keep -PRON- course although -PRON- seem every moment as though -PRON- must turn back 
a weird exaltation thrill -PRON- 
for the present i forget that i be seek the great zift to threaten -PRON- in case -PRON- seize upon the misfortune of nyll to make an invasion of the country 
again the polar explorer search for that baffling and elusive thing call the north pole 
vith -PRON- eye turn straight ahead of -PRON- i press on and on 
at last -PRON- reach a point beyond which -PRON- would have be suicide to venture 
and there before -PRON- arise the coal of -PRON- ambition 
adequatcly to describe the soulinspiring spectacle be beyond -PRON- 
no pen could do justice to the scene least of all mine which heretofore have be comnfine to the simple annal of the log book 
i have see a volcano in eruption and the vomiting forth of fire and smoke and dust bear some resemblance to this polar phenomenon 
here the zone of activity be half a mile in diameter completely circular 
within the vortex as the veil shift the great spindle be disclose a mighty bulwark of celestial law and orderwithout which there could be no night no dayno certainty of recur seasonsno life on this fruitful planet entrance -PRON- stand and watch the wondrous whirligig perform -PRON- mighty evolution 
nearly three hundred and fifty foot per hour -PRON- move more than five foot per minutethe grand majestic sweep of a vast world set spin in the night of age by the allpowerful hand 
prebble and i stand dumb in the presence of the stupendous mechanism koz and -PRON- son lie prostrate pour upon -PRON- head the dust of humility and reverence 
thus in -PRON- several way do the finite pay tribute to the infinite 
-PRON- must build a cairn say i hoarsely turn -PRON- bloodshot eye upon prebble 
why a cairn -PRON- ask 
as a mark to commemorate this visit a proof to any who follow that captain sali and phinea prebble have be here before -PRON- 
the chur be here before any of -PRON- say prebble 
can -PRON- go away and claim the discovery of the north pole when human eye have already look upon -PRON- 
-PRON- eye look out at -PRON- from lid inflame by the heat twinkle oddly 
-PRON- have be first to pierce the ice wall i answer and be entitle to be call discoverer 
suaviter in modo fortiter in re murmur -PRON- learn companion 
-PRON- may just as well claim the discovery without see the thing discover 
i see small difference in the ethic of the case 
-PRON- hop around to ease -PRON- stew foot 
if -PRON- be on cool ground professor say -PRON- may go into thatsubject more exhaustively give -PRON- attention to the cairn however 
who will know what the cairn stand for in case -PRON- happen to be find 
-PRON- will leave a tablet and a flag hot for such work and the professor draw a hand across -PRON- dripping forehead and i fail to see the usefulness of -PRON- 
explorer always build cairn i cry irritably 
then mivabile dictu let -PRON- build one set the chur to collect stone i order while i prepare the tablet 
-PRON- hop away over the steam stone and get the chur at work 
after a short search i discover a piece of flat slatelike rock soft enough to take the sharp point of a piece of agate 
with great care i scratch the following on the slate tablet at this point during the summer of arrived captain sali and professor phinea prebble have set out from america in the year on a voyage of discovery and exploration 
i show the inscription to prebble -PRON- have leave out the most important point -PRON- cry 
what be that 
-PRON- have say nothing about -PRON- own discovery the proof i have develop regard the meteoric theory of the aurora add that as a postscript say by way of humor -PRON- 
so i append the following during the progress of the polar expedition say professor prebble demonstrate the truth ot the meteoric theory of the aurora 
will that do 
i inquire 
very well -PRON- answer greatly pleased 
now if neither of -PRON- live to return to -PRON- own country and some other explorer be able to come to this benighted region shall have -PRON- niche in the hall of fame 
but the tablet be still incomplete 
the tablet already hadscorche -PRON- finger and be become altogether too hot for any more inscription 
what else be there i ask impatiently 
-PRON- theory concern the failure of the human mind north of the arctic circle say -PRON- 
put that in will not i answer and go down on -PRON- knee to affix the eiece of slate in the hot earth 
upon this -PRON- pile -PRON- gather rock 
i superintend the laying of the stone and consider the difficulty under which -PRON- work i believe that a most excellent cairn be construct and one that must still remain on that very spot 
-PRON- be try labor and -PRON- sweat over the task 
the chur labor in a state of awe and apprehension pause constantly to look around -PRON- as though -PRON- expect something to happen -PRON- scarcely know what 
-PRON- action communicate to -PRON- a certain uncanny feeling which have begin with the vast mechanism of the pole -PRON- get nervous confide the professor 
-PRON- be in a region well qualified to make any one nervous i answer make ready to lay the final stone on the apex of the heap have do with this cairn building captain and move to some other place 
-PRON- must continue -PRON- examination of the pole say greatly regret that -PRON- have not the instrument mecessary to make an observation too torrid for observation and -PRON- have already linger here so long that the sol of -PRON- foot be literally do to a turn 
perhaps -PRON- shall never be able to come here again and -PRON- ought to make the most of -PRON- visit 
at the precise moment the final stone be add to the heap -PRON- attention be attract by fearful cry from the chur 
i face about and at once -PRON- startled gaze encounter a sight that freeze -PRON- blood 
the veil of smoke dust and flame be part by a form that plunge through -PRON- like a swimmer through the sea separate the red billow with -PRON- naked hand 
the figure be that of a chur of gigantic proportion -PRON- face be the face of the archfiend monstrous in -PRON- every feature be like diamond the tooth long yellow and two of -PRON- overhang the neth liplike tusk the long red hair writhe as so many tongue of fire about head and shoulder and the long furry limb move with marvelous rapidity 
a whip seem lash -PRON- brain with stinging force and at every blow the voice of sertez rang in -PRON- ear the great ziff 
now will -PRON- believe 
in one hand this hideous giant carry a skull in the other hand a thigh bone 
again and again -PRON- would strike the skull and a dull sepulchral sound would be the result 
as -PRON- pound -PRON- horrid drum -PRON- would roar in monotonous tone syllable which sound like then at interval -PRON- would lift the thigh bone and point southward 
-PRON- must not be suppose that -PRON- see this frightful creature lony 
at one leap -PRON- clear the pole and touch earth then away -PRON- fly at a brobdingnagian pace pomte southward peate the skull and roar -PRON- i look at prebble 
-PRON- head be in -PRON- hand 
i turn to where the chur have be lyinz and see that -PRON- have depart follow the great ziff at top speed 
have -PRON- series of remarkable adventure in this circumpolar country not harden -PRON- to the improbable and the unexpected prebble and i would have think -PRON- go daft get out of this say the professor huskily pick up the biscuit and pemmican bag 
i grab the shotgun irom the rock scarcely notice that the barrel blister -PRON- hand 
then away -PRON- go on the track of the great ziff koz bigoll and xit 
what be -PRON- present opinion of the great ziff prebble 
i ask when -PRON- have reach cool ground and could walk and talk with some little comfort ask -PRON- -PRON- beg 
imagination appear to have take the place of sober sense 
event follow event so swiftly that all seem a riot of the imagination 
the scientific mind find nothing firm enough to stand on and hence all scientific deduction fall flat 
i behold and marvel captain i make no attempt to explain 
the fury be unleashed say i sadly 
nyl will beoverrun and all -PRON- magnificent civilization lay waste 
the great ziff head the ally pack and every chur be like a raven woll 
-PRON- must hasten back to nyll aver the professor 
but what can -PRON- do 
-PRON- can save the kingdom -PRON- answer promptly or as much of -PRON- as be leave when -PRON- arrive 
how leave that to -PRON- 
let -PRON- care be the rescue of princess ylma 
-PRON- apprehension spur -PRON- on to great effort 
just before -PRON- reach the defile from which -PRON- have issue o begin -PRON- journey to the pole -PRON- surmount an elevation that afford -PRON- a viw of the wall the break gate and the plaiz beyond 
a host of chur be flow southward 
the pcssage through the wall be like a strait the animate billow crush through and spread out once more on reach the sandy stretch as far as the eye could reach the inundation roll and -PRON- have no doubt that in the lead rush the great ziff sound -PRON- infernal tocsin and roar -PRON- mysterious slogan 
thus ignorance overwhelm learn mutter prebble and brute force subdue the mind 
let -PRON- not halt i cry in herce impatience on prebble on 
-PRON- could not overtake the procession of warrior but -PRON- come among the woman and child straggle along in the rear 
-PRON- be hour before -PRON- reach the populous portion of nyll and what a melanholy spectacle greet -PRON- on every hand 
house be burn and the chris be everywhere like the red imp of satan carry -PRON- spoil upon -PRON- back or drive nyllite before -PRON- load with the loot of -PRON- own dwelling 
-PRON- appear to have be the policy of the great 
zift to spare that the chur may enslave everywhere there be brutality but nowhere could -PRON- see bloodshed 
as -PRON- make along the road toward the king palace an oyd car come tear toward -PRON- 
in the car be two man whom recognize as griffyn and pollock 
halt 
i command place -PRON- in the middle of the roadway and raise -PRON- hand

halt or i fire 
i cry agam 
this time be obey 
great heaven cry griffyn as -PRON- stop the car 
can this be salis andand prebble say -PRON- fail to recognize -PRON- i answer 
but i do though

what do -PRON- mean ask griffyn and pollock in one breath 
if that distillery have never be build say this awful invasion would never have happen 
i level a trembling forehnger at responsible for all 
-PRON- and prebble be responsible flung back pollock

-PRON- be all of -PRON- at fault but -PRON- be human life be dear to -PRON- and sometimes -PRON- buy -PRON- at too great a price 
have -PRON- any elixir on hand pollock 
several thousand kiss

then i will go with -PRON- and -PRON- will save the kingdom -PRON- turn on -PRON- with a hearty grip of the hand must leave -PRON- captain 
-PRON- be necessary for -PRON- have -PRON- work to do as i have mine 
-PRON- remember what -PRON- lordship tell -PRON- about the nyllite who penetrate the ice wall 
the work now go on be strictly accord to gneisen 
shrewd fellow that gneisen 
-PRON- spring into the oyd car 
similia similibus curantur 
to the distillery griffyn top speed 
while -PRON- have stand in the road talk many 
chur pass -PRON- but give -PRON- little notice 
possibly -PRON- be too intent on the nefarious work before -PRON- 
i journey horror thicken about -PRON- as i proceed 
a whir of wheel from behind claim -PRON- attention and i turn just as a familiar voice call -PRON- name 
a car be dart in iny direction to the broad seat in -PRON- center lord nyli be bind and in the front point be kiimon shriek like a fiend

the condition of affair could not be bad 
every slave in the country have rise and even the slave outnumber the nyllite two to one 
add -PRON- number to the horde that have sweep down on -PRON- from the north and -PRON- will understand how desperate be the situation 
klimon whom i have own for year turn on -PRON- and be conveyiny -PRON- to the great ziff

hope dart into -PRON- face have not think of that -PRON- say 
but let -PRON- on to the palace 
i be worried about -PRON- lord nyli take the driver seat and drive the car at full speed along the road 
many attempt be make to interfere with -PRON- but the shotgun stand -PRON- in good stead and -PRON- finally reach the palace step unmolested 
the king guard to the last warrior have turn against count zylox and -PRON- have be compel to barricade -PRON- in one of the state apartment

-PRON- yelp tone the clashing of -PRON- implement of war cause a deafen din in the room king boazar occupy the massive chair on the dais 
-PRON- hand hang listlessly over the arm and -PRON- head be bow forward -PRON- may have be an attitude of sorrow and despair but attribute -PRON- to another causc 
before -PRON- at the top old the short flight of step stand princess ylma -PRON- eyecs glow and li arm outspread to block the advance of sertez 
the renegade stand below -PRON- oot on the first step and -PRON- gloat gaze turn upward 
nothing can keep -PRON- apart now ylmal -PRON- cry have level every barrier that stand between -PRON-

these chur happen to be from the pack of koz 
thus i be know to -PRON- and the terror of the thunder maker which i carry throw over -PRON- a spell of silence and inaction 
princess ylma be gaze at -PRON- as though -PRON- dare not credit -PRON- sense

the count be a man after -PRON- own heart 
-PRON- show a spirit that arouse -PRON- admiration and i be sorry -PRON- be not a friend of mine 
sertez spring to the fray with a laugh and a taunt the count meet -PRON- bravely and spear strike spear 
then -PRON- be thrust parry thrust parrynow high now lowthe spear head shimmer as -PRON- dart toward each other like serpent count force sertez back step by step and again sertez press the count 
there be a monotony about -PRON- all in spite of the fascination which a battle to the death will always call forth 
but the monotony be suddenly varied

the combat go on 
zylox fight at a terrible disadvantage as be apparent to all of -PRON- and from the throne princess ylma watch with breathless lip and pallid cheek 
the stertorous breathing of the king come to -PRON- ear through the dead silence and now and again -PRON- would move restlessly and mutter incoherently once more there be the monotony of thrust and parry above below and clash clash as the spear head meet and send ring echo through the vault chamber 
a diversion come and come quickly 
the count slipie on the jasper tile and go down -PRON- weapon fly from -PRON- hmd a slight seream escape princess ylma 
with a cry of triumph sertez plunge at -PRON- opponent breast but strike the long shaft aside thereby earn curse from both sertez and the count then sertez and i go at -PRON-

poom poom poom echo the grinning skull roar the great ziff and point the thigh bone at the king 
the chur spring erect 
now captain if -PRON- can do anything whisper -PRON- lordship frantically now 
the giant be advance upon the throne 
in a trice i raise the gun and give -PRON- hoth barrel 
the roar in that confine space be awful beyond word 
as the smoke clear -PRON- see the great ziff sprawl on the floor 
-PRON- gaze be tell what i behold with -PRON- own eyeseven as -PRON- look -PRON- form fade into thin air so that -PRON- see nothing but the bloodred tile 
and then from without -PRON- hear the sepulchral sound of bone and skull and the roar of the ziff as strong as ever 
the chur rush from the throne room and from the palace while the count -PRON- lordship and i hasten to one of the window 
there this colossal creature stand gather -PRON- cohort unharme in body or limb 
i be sorry the professor be not a witness of this proceeding for -PRON- afterward tell -PRON- i must have be frighten out of -PRON- wit so that fear color -PRON- account of the extraordinary event 
those who have follow -PRON- so far i trust will know -PRON- better than that the palace door cry count zylox 
-PRON- three will hold the place against the invader 
-PRON- hurry to follow out -PRON- suggestion 
after every door have be secure -PRON- look down from a lofty window and to -PRON- infense surprise find that the great ziff and -PRON- follower have leave the vicinity of the palace 
-PRON- be safe for the present say lord nyli heave a sigh of relief 
the ziff will return aver the count 
until -PRON- do go on -PRON- lordship turn to -PRON- there will be little for -PRON- to do captain 
if -PRON- would like to go to the lavatory and make a change of garment i will be glad to conduct -PRON- 
-PRON- make the suggestion out of the kindness of -PRON- heart and i be grateful to -PRON- for -PRON- in truth i be a sorrylooke representative of the united state army as i stand before -PRON- 
i still wear what remain of -PRON- buskin but -PRON- be the sole relic of -PRON- former state 
in the land of the chur prebble and i have both don the prevail bearskin and while mine cover -PRON- from shoulder to knee and be respectable enough yet -PRON- be hardly a court even for those try time 
while i be engage in make myseli more presentable lord nyli from an adjoin room beguie -PRON- labor with conversation know -PRON- should hear from sertez in some such maunner say -PRON- 
who be this sertez 
i inquire scoundrel and a renegade have discover that much for -PRON- -PRON- lordship 
i have also learn that -PRON- have be among the chur since the beginning of the long day 
-PRON- be banish 
yes 
that be a mistake however 
mistake in this way captain -PRON- should have be condemn to death by oyd instead of merely be banish 
count zylox and i be anxious to see -PRON- receive the death penalty but princess ylma prevail with the king and sentence of banishment be pronounce 
i be wash the red stain from -PRON- shoulder 
the wound be merely a scratch and in no wise interfere with -PRON- uscfulness fagerly i caucht at -PRON- lordship mention of the princess why do the princess interfere in behalf of sertez i query 
that trench upon the matter for which sertez be send away be the reply 
there be no reason why i should not tell -PRON- about -PRON- captain 
-PRON- have becn of great service to the king and the princess md the kingdom be under a vast obligation to -PRON- shall be glad to hear about -PRON- say sertez -PRON- lordship go on be make much of by king boazar 
the fortune of sertez be small but wealth be no bar to advancement in the kingdom of nyll 
-PRON- majesty conceive a liking for sertez and take -PRON- into the palace as one of the gentleman in wait 
the possession of twenty chur entitle a nyllite to a patent of nobility for in the old time to rule a score of chur one prove the possession of a powerful intellect and intellect alone admit to the peerage 
one who aspire to be a noble be require to capture -PRON- chur with -PRON- own hand and subdue -PRON- 
sertez with great bravery win -PRON- twenly slave and be take into the palace as one of the king houschold 
-PRON- lordship pause for a moment have little time to dwell upon the peculiar ability necessary before one could become a noble of that queer kingdom 
once in the palace proceed lord nylis sertez have the presumption to lift -PRON- eyve to the princess 
thus in a way -PRON- prove -PRON- a serpent and strike at the hand which feed -PRON- 
princess ylma be design by the king as a mate for count zylox thus weld the two branch of the royal family together and avert discord when the time come for the king to pass 
sertez be that right lord nylis 
i demand 
should the king use -PRON- power to consummate such an alliance 
be not princess ylma to have a choice in the matter princess of the blood captain come sadly from -PRON- lordship be but pawn inthe game of royalty 
-PRON- lot be cast wherever policy may elect 
in this case and i quite coincide with -PRON- majesty the two branch of the roval family must be unite 
from what i have say about the king plan for -PRON- daughter vou will understand more clearly the presumption of sertez in aspire to the hand of the princess 
-PRON- repulse -PRON- and place the matter before the king 
i majesty be enrage and summon sertez before -PRON- to answer for -PRON- action 
sertez be find guilty and condemn to death by oyd 
princess ylma interfere and the sentence be commute to banishment 
the princess should not have interfere say most assuredly not but -PRON- have a tender heart and could not bear to think that sertez be to suffer death on -PRON- account 
-PRON- be all one with sertez now lord nylis 
-PRON- be spare to plan with the chur the destruction of the kingdom bu -PRON- end have finally overtake -PRON- 
the evil have be accomplish comment lord with a heavy sigh and -PRON- will be long before -PRON- country recover from the blow 
-PRON- be a lesson to -PRON- country say -PRON- should teach all of -PRON- to beware of anything indulgence in which will tend to becloud -PRON- faculty do not know the power of this elixir 
for which the pfofessor and i be guilty 
i acknowledge the debt -PRON- owe -PRON- people nylis and -PRON- be do what -PRON- can to atone for -PRON- misguided action lay nothing at -PRON- door captain 
-PRON- and -PRON- companion have to do something to preserve -PRON- life and -PRON- take the ready mean at hand be hopeful as -PRON- say that -PRON- country will profit by the grievous lesson 
do -PRON- think the professor will succeed in -PRON- am positive of -PRON- say with conviction 
prebble be an able man and when -PRON- set -PRON- hand to a piece of work -PRON- usually accomplish -PRON- 
the elixir be a weapon that work both way 
savage be especially partial to -PRON- 
the chur be not gift with the reason power of the will easily fall victim to the insidious beverage 
-PRON- and -PRON- people on the other hand will profit by the lesson and abstain from such elixir in future 
the easy way to make -PRON- abstain be to remove the elixir from among -PRON- 
the place where -PRON- be manufacture must be destroy at the early possible moment 
that will be attend to 
be the process of manufacture know to any of the yllite no pollock and griffyn have keep the process a secret good 
i exclaim 
before another hour have pass i feel a different man 
tmmediately after emerge from the lavatory and dress chamber i repair to the throne room 
princess ylma be still beside the king who be recover slightly and call for more of the elixir 
the moment i enter -PRON- descend and come toward -PRON- with outstretche hand 
the count as observed have thoughtfully drag the body of sertez rom the apartment and only the stain of blood remain to mark the spot where the sanguinary struggle have take place 
save for the king -PRON- be alone the princess and i catch -PRON- hand and hold -PRON- for a moment peer into -PRON- wonderful hlue cye 
a knew -PRON- would come -PRON- say softly -PRON- lid droop and the color come and go in -PRON- full round cheek come quickly -PRON- princess say but could not arrive before the chur 
-PRON- be a stranger -PRON- say flash a quick look at -PRON- and i can not be -PRON- princess 
neverthelessx i return drop on one knee and press -PRON- hand to -PRON- lip -PRON- be -PRON- princess and must call -PRON- so 
-PRON- raise -PRON- gently be tell that -PRON- would not be able to learn the secret of the gorr plate -PRON- proceed as i stand at -PRON- side learn -PRON- i answer not think -PRON- necessary to describe the means 
then be i ble -PRON- hesitate -PRON- lip be ever in -PRON- heart i whisper 
and -PRON- think of -PRON- in the same manner that i think of -PRON- 
yes i reply 
lver since -PRON- save -PRON- companion and -PRON- at the lake -PRON- have never be absent from either mind or heart 
a lover must be allow some latitude even at the pole where latitude be stretch to -PRON- farth limit 
-PRON- withdraw -PRON- hand quickly 
turn -PRON- make -PRON- way back to the throne and sit on the step 
come -PRON- say make a place beside -PRON- 
i wish to ask -PRON- if -PRON- and -PRON- companion can be of any aid to this poor country in -PRON- present plight 
-PRON- shall do -PRON- good to save the country be -PRON- response and i believe that success will attend -PRON- effort 
the professor be now engage in the work griffyn and pollock be with -PRON- 
nothing can be do -PRON- declare with spirit this elixir be destroy to the last drop 
i have give order for the burning of the building in which -PRON- be make 
the professor countermand -PRON- order 
-PRON- eye flash 
why -PRON- ask imperiousuy 
because although -PRON- have be the mean of bring woe and unhappiness to nyll -PRON- may yet be employ in save the country 
the elixir be a good servant but a bad master 
how may the elixir be employ 
let the chur partake of -PRON- and -PRON- will render -PRON- helpless 
then the nyllite may rise conquer the savage and resume -PRON- use of the elixir -PRON- interrupt sorrowfully 
no 
after the chur have be conquer then burn the distillery and let every keese of the elixir be pour on the ground 
-PRON- clap -PRON- hand and a joyful look overspread -PRON- face 
but the joy be shortlive 
and then -PRON- resume the king will order the other stranger to build a new distillery as -PRON- call -PRON- and -PRON- will have to comply in order to save -PRON- life 
princess return -PRON- poor life have be the cause of all this misery 
have the professor and i not value -PRON- existence so highly the king would never have taste the content of that first flask nor would the second flask have be give -PRON- nor would the distillery have be build 
be -PRON- sure -PRON- will demand more of the elixir when -PRON- recover reason and see what direful consequence have follow -PRON- use the taste be strong upon -PRON- -PRON- drink the brown fluid continually be sure -PRON- will order more of -PRON- 
in that event say i grimly griffyn the professor and must leave the country where will -PRON- go -PRON- ask tremulously 
back to -PRON- own land 
beyond the ice wall -PRON- hand creep toward -PRON- and catch -PRON- clingingly 
yes 
will there not be danger in the attempt suppose so be -PRON- glum rejoinder 
will -PRON- not dread to face -PRON- -PRON- cheek be close to mine -PRON- starvy eye fix upon -PRON- own and burn with a light that thrill -PRON- 
i place -PRON- other hand about -PRON- waist shall dread face the danger much less than leave the princess ylma 
-PRON- sigh 
tell -PRON- of -PRON- own country -PRON- sard 
be -PRON- a wonderful land like our 
in some way more wonderful but in other less so 
-PRON- have no gorr plate no oyd car no king no princess but -PRON- have -PRON- ziff many of -PRON- and all fully as terrible as the one -PRON- have lately see 
do -PRON- not destroy the mind of the people 
the brown fluid do that then come the ziff 
do the ziff bring -PRON- chur 
-PRON- have no chur princess 
every man be -PRON- own chur 
these shaggy monster skulk in the trail of the brown fluid and battle with the man well self until the ziff come and finish the work 
-PRON- shudder should not like -PRON- country -PRON- say 
onlys if -PRON- be there even such a land may be paradise for -PRON- 
the word be still on -PRON- lip as i pluck the last one with a kiss -PRON- scoundrel count zylox 
the princess push from -PRON- with a ittle cry and -PRON- both look up to find the captain of the guard regard -PRON- with a scowl 
i arise haughtily can not forget that i be in the presence of a lady say or i should answer -PRON- speech in kind 
eavesdropper rarely hear anything to -PRON- liking 
-PRON- introduce a curse into the land sneer the count and after destroy the people -PRON- attempt the destruction of the king only daughter so liar 
i cry 
-PRON- base insinuation be too much for -PRON- hot blood 
i launch -PRON- toward -PRON- and have not the princess interfere would have teach -PRON- a lesson then and there 
the king daughter be between -PRON- hand fall and i step back 
-PRON- pardon princess ylma murmur 
aly at somie other time and in some other place -PRON- shall yield -PRON- satisfaction for -PRON- word 
-PRON- shall not -PRON- return a very queen in speech and bearing shall prove -PRON- manhood by ignore a man who forget -PRON- as count zylox have do 
-PRON- face the count desire -PRON- to leave this room 
there aie other thing to command -PRON- attention at the present moment 
nothing more imiportant than this -PRON- answer 
-PRON- bend -PRON- eye upon -PRON- steadily 
withdraw -PRON- command 
for the first time i see that the count have the shotgun in -PRON- hand 
let -PRON- first give -PRON- that weapon princess ylma i request 
take -PRON- say the count savagely and fling -PRON- with all the force of -PRON- left arm down on the tile 
the piece be break beyond repair 
-PRON- heart sink for i have count on use the gun in defense of the palace should -PRON- be attack 
as the count turn on -PRON- heel a loud commotion be hear at the palace entrance 
-PRON- hurry away and i start to follow 
promise -PRON- before -PRON- go say princess yima that -PRON- will not renew this quarrel promise say and hasten on 
-PRON- be unnecessarily alarm by the noise on the palace step 
the great ziff have not return with the chur but pollock have come with an oyd car and a tank of elixir 
-PRON- report that prebble griffyn and -PRON- have start in different direction through the kingdom each with a large quantity of the brown fluid 
this be be judiciously distribute among the chur 
-PRON- be wild atter the stuff say pollock and be cast aside -PRON- loot -PRON- shield and spear and even allow -PRON- prisoner to escape so that -PRON- may drink more and more of the fire water 
in twentyfour hour if the nyllite will rise nyll will be -PRON- once more 
pollock leave after be reassure as to the safety of the king and the princess 
i run back to the throne room to acquaint the princess with the progress of the good work but the apartment be desert 
since there be rfo danger to threaten i throw -PRON- down in one of the reclining room to rest after the exciting event of the last few hour 
wear out i fall asleep 
when i awake i be not in the reclining room 
all around -PRON- be black darkness and a dank smell as from moldy wall 
what have happen to -PRON- 
i dash -PRON- hand across -PRON- face to free -PRON- brain from the evil spell that seem to encompass -PRON- 
still the darkness would not lift 
be i mad 
i reach out on either side 
on -PRON- right space on -PRON- left a blank slippery wall 
i feel below 
i be lie on a slab of stome 
staggering erect i grope -PRON- way aimlessly about 
presently i come to another wall 
turn i pace to the wall opposite 
twenty pace 
detween wall the other way i also count twenty pace 
then i climb upon the block of stone and reach upward -PRON- finger touch the roof 
under -PRON- around above nothing but granite 
sit down on the slab i bow -PRON- head in -PRON- hand be a prisoner there be no doubt of that 
but how have -PRON- be able to carry -PRON- off without wake -PRON- 
i be not a heavy sleeper and the croon of a rope through an oil sheave have more than once send -PRON- from niy bunk 
i smell an odor strange to -PRON- nostril 
abh i have be drug 
resistance be fear and these man who be wide awake for six month of the year have take advantage of -PRON- in -PRON- sleep and drug and imprison -PRON- 
-PRON- be zylox of course 
-PRON- have see -PRON- with the princess have hear -PRON- conversation and -PRON- have increase -PRON- enmity toward -PRON- 
-PRON- be a brave man and have the good of the kingdom at heart 
but brave man be weak when strike on the side of -PRON- affection 
-PRON- love the princess and -PRON- care nothing for -PRON- 
-PRON- would not brook interfence on -PRON- part and death be to be -PRON- portion 
i wonder how long an interval have pass since i lie down in the reclining room 
i also think of prebble and wonder if -PRON- have succeed in save the klingdom what would -PRON- do when -PRON- hear that i be a prisoncr 
what could -PRON- do 
possibly -PRON- would not hear 
no doubt i be in the stronghold of count zylox where i conld be deal with at -PRON- enemys pleasure 
and the princess 
would -PRON- ever know -PRON- fate 
as i sit there with bow head a door open raspingly and light strike across the gloom look up and see the count enter accompany by four armed chur 
i spring erect and rush toward -PRON- but two spear cross front of -PRON- breast and stay mec 
keep -PRON- distance say the count 
be there a spark of honor or manhood about -PRON- i cry 
will -PRON- not orant -PRON- the satisfaction one gentleman may yield another face to face would not soil -PRON- hand fight coward 
-PRON- smile ith -PRON- cage rat may rage at a lion say -PRON- coolly 
where be in a dungeon of the king palace 
why be i here lese majesty 
high treason 
i exclaim trumpedup charge zylox 
no stranger in the country can commit treason 
no but -PRON- can do bad and plan odious thing 
i tremble with anger 
tt be not the part of a brave man to taunt a prisoner unable to defend -PRON- say then donot force -PRON- with -PRON- question 
do the king know i be here 
-PRON- be here by -PRON- order 
then -PRON- have poison -PRON- mind against -PRON- have simply tell -PRON- the truth and -PRON- have draw -PRON- own conclusion 
what be to be do with -PRON- 
what should have be do when -PRON- and -PRON- comrade first show yourself in the land 
-PRON- add laconically death by oyd 
i sink down on the stone slab 
when 
i ask after a moment 
in two hour 
where 
here in this cell 
-PRON- impending doom strange as -PRON- may seem have a quieting effect upon -PRON- nerve 
what of the kingdom i ask 
-PRON- and will live to the end of time under the reign of the almikboazar 
the chur be all enslave and the great ziff have flee to the unknown 
heaven be praise for that 
the professor be successful in -PRON- attempt to save the land 
the weapon that work the havoc be turn upon -PRON- foe 
small credit to this professor of yours 
-PRON- and -PRON- introduce the evil so -PRON- be -PRON- business to stamp -PRON- out if -PRON- could 
-PRON- be safe 
i ask 
yes -PRON- and the other two 
-PRON- will be give safe conduct to the ice wall 
i -PRON- return to the country -PRON- fate will be -PRON- 
leave -PRON- in peace say will -PRON- have more peace with a light -PRON- sneer have bring -PRON- one 
one of the slave carry two luminous globe 
at a signal from the count -PRON- lay one of the globe on the floor say zylox with a grim laugh a hour and pass out with -PRON- attendant 
the door be secure and again leave alone 
the light however make -PRON- situation more endurable 
even when confront by death a man mind will deal with trivial thing 
i marvel at the luminous globe for -PRON- be not feed with oil nor have -PRON- a wick 
-PRON- resemble a sphere of glass but if -PRON- be glass -PRON- be the first speciman of -PRON- i have see in nyll 
i walk to the globe bent over -PRON- and pick -PRON- up 
something white lie under -PRON- 
hastily i put down the globe and possess -PRON- of the object 
-PRON- be a bit of fold linen 
i unfold -PRON- and find that -PRON- bear queer mark upon -PRON- surface make with a yellow pigment long and earnestly i study the mark but could make nothing of -PRON- 
i turn the square of linen upside down and still the character be not legible 
suddenly a thought strike -PRON- and i remove the talk ring 
i have find the key to the situation for the word be write in english and of course i could not read -PRON- while think in nyll keep a stiff upper lip captain 
-PRON- friend have not abandon -PRON- will be with -PRON- presently 
the note be unsigned but i know -PRON- must come from prebble 
the light bearer have be bribe to lay down the note with the glohe 
hope revive in -PRON- breast although for the life of -PRON- i could not understand how get out of the dungeon would save -PRON- from impend doom 
after escape from the palace i would still have to leave the kingdom and to do that unseen in the broad glare of that long day would be impossible 
for some time i continue to rack -PRON- brain with doubt 
then again come the creak of the door and prebble stand before -PRON- 
-PRON- also be cladin a new tunic and through the lense of -PRON- spectacle -PRON- eye beam encouragingly 
i rush to -PRON- and catch -PRON- by both hand 
prebble 
i exclaim 
how have vou manage to come tome lord nyli request -PRON- of the king as a personal favor -PRON- answer 
the king be determine on -PRON- death -PRON- be adamant 
if that flask of bourbon be to be blame for -PRON- -PRON- be strange the rest of vou be not here with -PRON- 
-PRON- be not on account of the flask of bourbon captain 
the rest of -PRON- have not dare to make love to princess yima 
then as i expect zylox be the move force agamst -PRON- 
not only zylox but the whole lord nylis 
-PRON- regret the occurrence but -PRON- have make -PRON- -PRON- friend and -PRON- stand by -PRON- 
what of the princess 
i smile 
-PRON- stand by -PRON- too and there have be stormy time in the palace the princess entreat -PRON- father to spare -PRON- and -PRON- father only wish -PRON- have nine life like a cat so -PRON- could take -PRON- all 
-PRON- have commit a very heinous offense captain 
l could not help -PRON- nor would i have help -PRON- if i could like -PRON- 
but i must not squander anything so valuable as time at the present moment 
plan have be make to rescue -PRON- 
to get -PRON- out of the palace 
yes 
what will -PRON- avail 
suppose i do get out of the palace what then 
must i hide -PRON- somewhere until the long night while all nyll sleep hardly 
griffyn have construct a new balloon construct a balloon 
i gasp 
that be -PRON- 
-PRON- have make -PRON- out of a royal cloth weave from thread spin byspider 
griffyn have really do remarkably well 
the structure use as a distillery form -PRON- workroom and while -PRON- be ostensibly assist pollock in the manu facture of spirit -PRON- be really construct this airship 
-PRON- utilize what material -PRON- could take from the wreck of the old balloon and the result be most creditable 
the bag be now be inflate in an open space near where the distillery use to be 
the gin mill have be burn to the ground -PRON- know and there be not a drop of elixir to be have anywhere in the kingdom 
will griffyn feeling as -PRON- do toward -PRON- take -PRON- with -PRON- 
i inquire doubtfully 
misfortune have draw -PRON- all together captain and feeling toward -PRON- have undergo a hange 
besides i insure -PRON- assage in the agreement 
what agreement balloon be not of much use without gas 
griffyn could make the balloon but -PRON- could not make the gas 
i have do that in return for the privilege of -PRON- be allow to go with -PRON- in the airship 
and the balloon be beinr inflate -PRON- say 
-PRON- will be ready for uce by the time -PRON- be ready to use -PRON- 
but i be to meet -PRON- fate within two hour 
-PRON- laugh 
so -PRON- be but not in the way -PRON- imagine 
now listen captain shortly after i leave a slave will come to -PRON- with food 
when -PRON- go out -PRON- will accompany -PRON- 
-PRON- understand and there will be notrouble 
when -PRON- part from the chur some one else will take -PRON- in charge 
that be all 
-PRON- be think that i have come to say good by to -PRON- so i must ng or suspicion will be arouse not hnfrer too lo say do everything i be tell to do pfessmg hand 
prebble go away and i pace the confine of the dungeon impatiently while wait for the chur with whom i be to depart 
-PRON- come in due course nervous to a degree and frighten almost out of -PRON- wit by the part -PRON- be plave 
through damp and tortuous underground passage i be conduct until -PRON- seem as though -PRON- have traverse several mile of labyrinth 
when -PRON- reach the end -PRON- be at a flight of stone step lead upward 
the chur ascend the step and push at an iron door 
after some effort -PRON- succeed in throw the door open and daylight penetrate the gloom 
as the slave stand on the topmost step i see hand reach over and lie a golden chain around -PRON- neck 
-PRON- face quiver with joy and -PRON- kiss the hand before -PRON- be withdraw 
then -PRON- beckon -PRON- and stand aside while i pass up and out 
the exit let -PRON- out of door grove stretch around -PRON- and i could see no one not even the person who have confer the gold necklace upon the chur 
i turn to question the slave by sign but -PRON- have disappear cover the spot where i have gain the surface from below and so nicely be the door fit into the turf that no eye could detect -PRON- presence 
as i stand wait i hear a soft voice captain 
behind -PRON- stand princess ylma have just step out from among the tree 
i hurry to -PRON- catch -PRON- in -PRON- arm and press -PRON- lip to -PRON- be not expect -PRON- ylma i say 
do -PRON- think i would abandon -PRON- -PRON- return a surprised look on -PRON- face 
no nonot that 
i be sure -PRON- could do nothing 
the professor in fact tell -PRON- how hard -PRON- have labor with the ling and how unsuccessful -PRON- be 
-PRON- father be very unkind to -PRON- -PRON- say with tremble lip 
-PRON- do not appreciate what -PRON- and the professor have donefor the kingdom 
-PRON- work the evil ylma and -PRON- be -PRON- duty to repair -PRON- as well as -PRON- could 
-PRON- majesty owe -PRON- nothing on that score 
but where be -PRON- 
have i not better be hasten to the airship 
be -PRON- so anxious to leave -PRON- then -PRON- pout wish that i may never leave -PRON- 
i answer fervently be forsake nyll for the good of the kingdom -PRON- understand

there be several car pursue -PRON- say -PRON- companion 
have -PRON- far to go 
i ask draw out the screen and give the car more speed 
only a little way 
there 
ahead of -PRON- be the airship 
a low hill bare of tree lay directly before -PRON- 
on the crest of the hill arise the fzur ruin wall of distillery and near the walle be the huge swaying bulk of the balloon 
in the sunlight the great globe look like frost silver 
about the basket i could see the form of prebble griffyn and pollock look down on -PRON- with frantically wave arm 
what be the matter with -PRON- i be ask -PRON- 
certainly the mere excitement attend -PRON- flight and pursuit could not cause such strange action on -PRON- part 
presently the road angle to the right and when -PRON- dash around -PRON- come upon six oyd car draw up abreast of each other across -PRON- path 
there be no get between the car and no swerve to right or leave to pass -PRON- 
thick wood flank each side of the way 
in order to avoid a wreck i be force to draw to a halt 
tn the name of the king shout a voice as a man arise in one of the car that confront -PRON- 
the whir and rumble of the other car could be hear advance upon -PRON- from behind 
tost exclaim ylma a heartbreake tone

i understand then that -PRON- be to leave the car and take to the wood 
not lose i pant springing to the ground the sword grip tightly in -PRON- right hand 
come 
-PRON- will gain the hill if heaven so will -PRON- or i shall die make the attempt 
-PRON- courage rise grandly to the occasion and -PRON- leap lightly to -PRON- side 
do -PRON- think there be hope -PRON- ask 
while there be life there be always hope 
with hand clasp -PRON- hurry into the deep shadow of the wood 
-PRON- be within spear throw but none of the ugly dart be iaunche at -PRON- 
-PRON- -PRON- be willing enough to spear but the princess be at -PRON- side and none dare risk a throw -PRON- order a voice rescue the princessnot a hair of -PRON- head must be injuredbut slay the foreign devilslay -PRON-

from behind -PRON- come a triumphant cry 
i pauscd turn and see that a chur have overtake -PRON-

-PRON- be ascend the hill now 
there be no timber and -PRON- be in plain view of -PRON- pursuer 
but still no spear be thrownthe danger to the princess be too great 
a hundred yard more and -PRON- would be at the balloon 
could i make -PRON- 
the chur be bound up the hillside from rock to rock come closer and closer at every spring 
the sweat stand out on -PRON- forehead in great drop -PRON- heart pound furiously and i could hear the roar of rush blood in -PRON- ear 
another of the chur be right at -PRON- heel 
then i perceive that griffyn and pallock be beside -PRON- 
a lusty righthander from pollock lay the chur in -PRON- track 
let -PRON- help -PRON- captain say griffyn 
between -PRON- -PRON- bear ylma the remain distance and place -PRON- in the basket 
in with -PRON- cry prebble sake hurry 
the professor be stand on the rim of the basket knife in hand wait to cut the rope that hold the balloon to earth 
i be throw into the basket by griffyn who pile in after -PRON- 
prebble cut the rope and -PRON- shoot skyward with pollock cling to the edge of the car 
i look over and downward 
nyll and the nyllite be recede rapidly 
as i gaze the chur hurl an impetent shower of spear which fall far short of -PRON- 
zylox be below and -PRON- be the last face i see 
-PRON- expression of hate and baffled rage be awful to behold 
as -PRON- figure fade and blur on -PRON- sight -PRON- be shake -PRON- fist upward at the mount airship 
save cry prebble jubilantly tell -PRON- that when -PRON- leave the dungeon captain -PRON- would meet -PRON- fate 
ylma smile and hold out -PRON- hand to -PRON- do not think of -PRON- word in this light say take the little hand in mine think the lot of -PRON- have have a time of -PRON- say griffyn 
so -PRON- have -PRON- hearty i return well that end well may i look over captain ask ylma 
certainly -PRON- may say and i hold -PRON- arm about -PRON- while -PRON- take a final look at -PRON- country and -PRON- people 
when -PRON- turn to mea moment later there be a smile of joy on -PRON- lip and tear of sorrow in -PRON- eye 
the wind favor -PRON- return southward say griffyn 
if nothing unforeseen happen -PRON- shall reach the land beyond the ice wall before the griffyn pause 
-PRON- could not calculate the ienzth of time that would be require for crossinz the kingdom and the frozen plain beyond 
l can make no guess about the length of time necessary to place -PRON- in comfort and safety say -PRON- but the present breeze seem to be as strong or strong than the wind that carrizd -PRON- north 
how many hour be -PRON- in the air on the other occasion inquire prebble 
-PRON- be twentyfive hour professor 
from the time -PRON- leave the spot where the balloon be inflate until pollock and i land in the parachute 
then by tomorrow if this wind hold and nothing go wrong with the gas bag -PRON- should be among the settlement say i yes nod griffyn donot think anything will go wrong with the balloon 
-PRON- hasbeen strongly construct and if the professor have furnish -PRON- with a good brand of gas -PRON- should make a landall safely and quickly 
-PRON- and the professor have do exceedingly well griffyn say approvingly 
the englishman laugh 
-PRON- life depend on -PRON- effort and -PRON- may be sure that -PRON- labor like a lot of bally slave 
-PRON- try to think of everythingfood water ballast and good warm clothing against -PRON- passage over the ice field have not have time as yet to note the equipment of the car 
now however i take occasion to look around -PRON- and find that -PRON- be snugly ensconce amony many package regret exceedingly say i that -PRON- be oblige to resort to so much violence in get away 
the nyllite and the chur get -PRON- whack return griffyn easily 
-PRON- life be at stake sali and -PRON- could not be expect to stand on ceremony 
-PRON- voice take on a note of reproach as -PRON- add -PRON- affection for the be hardly wise 
but for that there would have be no violence and no trouble 
-PRON- will kindly leave the princess out of the question i answer -PRON- sharply maintain however say -PRON- steadily that -PRON- be well that -PRON- leave -PRON- princess behind that i demand think i have not hear aright 
-PRON- would have be a calamity for all concerned have -PRON- bring princess ylma away with -PRON- 
nyll be -PRON- home and the nyllite be -PRON- people 
-PRON- would not thrive in a foreign land and to spirit -PRON- away be hardly the fair thing for the kingdom 
i stare at the man 
-PRON- could talk in that inexplicable strain with the princess in the car with -PRON- 
from -PRON- i turn to the professor 
-PRON- dear captain say prebble commiseratingly i be quite of opmion 
-PRON- do well to leave princess ylma behind -PRON- be unhurt in spite of the violent scene -PRON- both pass through and let -PRON- hope -PRON- will soon forget -PRON- and turn a more favoring cye upon zylox 
i turn to look toward the place where the princessmy princesswa stand 
-PRON- smile brightly at -PRON- and i whirl upon the professor and griffyn 
be -PRON- mad i shout 
or be -PRON- talk of leave the princess behind when -PRON- be here with -PRON- in plain view of all of -PRON- 
speak ylma 
i ask look around at -PRON- 
-PRON- be quite true captain ylma answer softly be with -PRON- and shall always be with -PRON- 
there 
i exclaim triumphantly 
griffyn and prebble merely smile at mesmile tolerantly and kindly trust with all -PRON- heart say prebble i ill will come to nylis for the aid -PRON- give s 
-PRON- have powerful friend at court speak up the princess and -PRON- lordship can not be harm 
to -PRON- anger and surprise no one in the car aside from -PRON- pay any attention to the princess word 
i begin to experience a bewderlng sensation a sensation which fill -PRON- with an astonishment that remain even to this day 
i step to the side of ylma speak to -PRON- i try to touch -PRON- with -PRON- hand 
where -PRON- have stand -PRON- be not the word i address to -PRON- receive no answer the hand i put forth touch only space 
where be -PRON- shout angrily 
what have -PRON- do with -PRON- 
griffyn 
prebble 
what have become of princess ylma 
i be angry for feel that some trick have be play upon -PRON- 
in -PRON- bewilderment and wrath i lay hand upon griffyn 
instantly -PRON- and prebble and pollock seize -PRON- in a fierce grip and while the car sway with the struggle i be bear down upon the bale and package double up in the confined space and hold by sheer force 
be the victim of a plot 
what plot could there be which prebble always loyal could take part against -PRON- 
suddenly a weight seem lift 
something snap in -PRON- brain or else the two end of a mental chain be reunite with a flashing as of live wire 
-PRON- anger fall from -PRON- and -PRON- lift hand drop nerveless 
what be -PRON- man try to do 
i mnqure 
thank heaven exclaim prebble 
lie will be all right now griffyn 
let hin sleep 
and somehow i do sleep 
i have now come to a part of this chronicle which have always be a mystery to -PRON- 
the event surround the escape from the land of nyll and especially those which have to do with the princess at that time have fade into the wraek leave by a weirdand in many respect a delightfuldream 
when i open -PRON- eye after fall asleep in the car i experience a disagreeable feeling of cold and discomfort 
griffyn prebble and pollock swathe in heavy garment be release bag of ballast with -PRON- mittene hand 
have -PRON- ballast enough 
i hear prebble inquire think so professor griffyn answer 
-PRON- see i have count upon the effect the frigid air over the ice field would have on the gas in the envelope 
the only way to counteract the loss of buoyancy be by hurl ballast out of the car 
therefore i make the balloon large and equip -PRON- with plenty of sandbag 
where be the princess demand sit up 
pollock have as little interest in -PRON- as i have inhim 
-PRON- keep to -PRON- work without pay the slight attention griffyn and prebble however face around and give -PRON- encouraging smile 
if -PRON- donot feel warm enough captain say prebble wrap another bearskin around -PRON- 
this climate be vastly different from that of nyll 
but where be the princess 
i persist 
safely in the palace i make no doubt and i hope there be peace between -PRON- and -PRON- father and that count zylox be find favor 
-PRON- be a worthy gentleman in spite of the fact that -PRON- have -PRON- difference and -PRON- deserve the good of fortune 
i look around the car confuse and wonder e knock zylox off -PRON- lordship car with the gorr plate i observe be when -PRON- find -PRON- wait for -PRON- instead of lord nyli 
-PRON- be no insignificant blow i can tell -PRON- 
the professor cackle 
then captain -PRON- have leave with -PRON- a memento say -PRON- 
probably -PRON- will not treasure -PRON- will -PRON- not tell -PRON- what have become of the princess beg pass a mittened hand over -PRON- brow 
-PRON- remember bound up the rock carry princess ylma in -PRON- arm ask the professor remember that yes i answer eagerly 
and do -PRON- remember that griffyn and pollock come to -PRON- rescue just as a chur have knock -PRON- flat with a blow from behind remember about griffyn and pollock but i be not strike down by the chur 
blank astonishient cross the professor face 
i proceed to recite the progress of event from that point 
-PRON- be pollock who bowl over the chur 
then griffyn help -PRON- carry yima to the balloon and -PRON- place -PRON- in the basket 
-PRON- tumble in after -PRON- 
-PRON- prebble be standine on the rim of the basket a knife in vour haud and the moment -PRON- be all aboard -PRON- slash a rope in twain and the balloon sail away into spacc 
the chur fling a shower of spear afier -PRON- but -PRON- fall short 
zylox be below and -PRON- face be the last one i see that i can distinctly remember 
ylma be with usthere can be no doubt on that score 
-PRON- want to take a final look at the kingdom of nyl as ve sweep over -PRON- and i remember steady -PRON- as hc peer over the edge of the basket 
pollbck have look around in considerable astonishment 
prebble and griffyn be exchange puzzle look face be first to clear 
why say -PRON- with a laugh from the mompent griffyn and pollock go to -PRON- rescue captain -PRON- fancy have be play weird prank 
-PRON- prove -PRON- add jubilantly -PRON- theory regard the irresponsible of the mind north of the arctic circle be correct mean to say cry protestingly that i imagine all that about -PRON- escape with the princess exactly that say prebble 
what really happen captain be this -PRON- be wait for -PRON- at the balloon and -PRON- hardly think -PRON- possible for -PRON- to get clear of -PRON- enemy 
but -PRON- do manage to force a way through -PRON- by leave the road and take to the wood 
ve see -PRON- hard beset climb the rock with the princess in -PRON- arm griffyn and pollock sally out to do what -PRON- could 
just as -PRON- reach -PRON- a chur floor -PRON- with a blow 
-PRON- fall and the princess drop from -PRON- arm 
griffyn and pollock could not bear away both -PRON- and the princess so -PRON- pick -PRON- up and carry -PRON- to the balloon 
-PRON- be half daze and wholly irrational 
the princess be not here but -PRON- insist on talk to -PRON- just as though -PRON- be here 
-PRON- grow angry when -PRON- try to explain and -PRON- be necessary for -PRON- to use force 
while -PRON- be hold -PRON- down -PRON- seem to recover -PRON- wit but the delusion regard the princess have not be dispel 
i trust i have make that matter clear to -PRON- now however canot understand -PRON- i mutter 
although i could not understand yet i be force to accept explanation princess be not in the car 
this one fact prove -PRON- in error would almost as readily think that -PRON- experience in the land of nyll and among the chur be equally a product of -PRON- imagination say not at all speak up griffyn for -PRON- have the testimony of the rest of -PRON- to adduce in prooi 
that blow on the head deal by the chur be what do the business for -PRON- sali have no recollection of -PRON- 
-PRON- head be bandage 
that ought to be suflicient proof even though the hurt be cause -PRON- no discomfort 
i be conscious then of a throbbing at the back of -PRON- head joke of -PRON- all be cackle the professor that the captain knock coitat zylox off the oyd car with a love letter from the princess 
that letter be impress in a block of carnelian and weigh a pound 
griffyn smile and pollock laugh outright 
i lean back against the framework of the car and wonder if i have really recover -PRON- sense 
-PRON- romance with the princess have come to a most unsatisfactory conclusion 
-PRON- heart be deeply involved and the disappointment be bitter 
prebble see how hard i take the affair knelt down beside -PRON- 
let -PRON- assure -PRON- captain say -PRON- that -PRON- be well the affair end in this way 
i shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- go on with -PRON- reason -PRON- be good that princess ylma should remain in -PRON- own land among -PRON- own people 
good for -PRON- and good for the kingdom 
the line of the boazar end with ylma 
have -PRON- bear the princess away the kingdom would indeed have have cause to consider -PRON- demon of destruction 
-PRON- may find -PRON- hard to reconcile -PRON- to the fact now but in year to come -PRON- will be glad the matter turn out as -PRON- have 
i keep -PRON- head howe in gloomy silence besides proceed prebble -PRON- have leave behind -PRON- a few good fricnd 
if the princess remam to mtercede for them7for lord nvli particularly -PRON- may console -PRON- with a wellgrounded hope that -PRON- will not suffer for arde in -PRON- escape 
then there be -PRON- word come in startled tone from griffyn 
prebble scramble to -PRON- foot and jomed griffyn who be look excitedly over the rim of the basket 
pollock also be contain -PRON- only with great diffculty 
glory cry the professor exultantly 
look captain

rom the ship 
here be something to take -PRON- mind off the amazing tangle in which -PRON- have become mvolve 
scramble erect lean on the rim of the car and look down be perhaps five hundred foot in the atr and only maintain that height by the expenditure of vast quantity of ballast 
below and a littie way to the south be dog sledge cap high with provision 
around the sledge be the eskimo and in front of the lead sledze stand the furclad man from the ship 
i recognize lieutenant corson -PRON- second in command and bentnick -PRON- doctor 
-PRON- be on the way to the ice cap say wave -PRON- hand to the startled man below 
after the eskimo get back to the ship corson lose no time in start out make a landing griffyvn -PRON- and pollock say i turn to prebble and grip -PRON- hand 
-PRON- danger be nearly over with prebble say soon be aboard ship and under the flag 
which put -PRON- a long step toward home cry the professor delightedly wonder where -PRON- ship be pollock ask griffyn of -PRON- secretary 
heaven know

-PRON- may need -PRON- testimony to substantiate -PRON- claim 
-PRON- can help -PRON- there 
-PRON- catch the valve cord 
stand at the edge of the basket i watch while -PRON- settle slowly toward the gleam plain of white 
almost that princess ylma be beside -PRON- and almost i could hear -PRON- voice give -PRON- final message -PRON- be quite true captain i be with -PRON- and shall always be with -PRON-

i mean to get up with yon craft before nightfall if -PRON- fetch -PRON- stick out 
dale nod but order new tackle bend onto the weather rig and the sheet flatten a little so as to take the strain from the bending spar 
the excitement be intense 
not a man on board the ship but be eager for a brush with the british vessel if indeed -PRON- be british 
-PRON- will teach the beggar a lesson quoth old bill cuff the boatswain to a group of -PRON- mate who have gather about -PRON- to glean from -PRON- fig the veteran opinion of the chance there be of a scrimmage when -PRON- overhaul the two big vessel ahead 
the latter seem to be under no particular apprehension though -PRON- must have long since sight the little yankee squadron 
as jone have say -PRON- be two of the leviathan threedecker of the english navy 
as -PRON- stand about in the bright sunlight the flash atlantic wave heel -PRON- over till -PRON- show -PRON- copper 
both of -PRON- sport three row of port a side 
-PRON- seem madness on the part of the young american commander to pit -PRON- tiny fleet against two such formidable fighting machine but as the british have learn to -PRON- cost -PRON- take more than heavy odd against -PRON- to deter the young sea eagle as people have already begin to call -PRON- from face -PRON- country foe 
hurrah exclaim the young ensign -PRON- be in for a fight sure

at this juncture a strange interruption occur in the shape of an exceedingly fat and exceedingly black negro who be project from the door of the galley with a force that suggest that -PRON- movement be not entirely voluntary 
the ship be heel over to the ever stiffening breeze till -PRON- lee scupper be all awash 
the unfortunate cook for such be the office of thedarky who have just emerge from the little galley hold in -PRON- hand a large kid of steam pea soup which be destine for the men dinner 
-PRON- have intend to carry -PRON- forward but as -PRON- cross the threshold of -PRON- domain the ship give a lurch and the negro give a yell as -PRON- feel -PRON- and -PRON- savory burden be gradually impel toward the boiling puddle of the scupper 
scipio seem to be in trouble say dale as -PRON- eye light on the struggle darky 
the word have hardly leave -PRON- lip before a second chocolatecolore face be poke out of the galley door and a second portly senegambian go staggering to the aid of -PRON- unfortunate fellow cook 
old bill cuff see -PRON- predicament 
sink -PRON- if -PRON- feller ainot go to let the crew dinner go to feed the fish -PRON- angrily exclaim as the two darkie wildly gesticulate be force nearer and ever nearer to the seething scupper 
the old bosun be a man of action and -PRON- do not waste any time on mere word but plunge gallantly to the rescue of the two struggle cook

ef yer spill that thar soup ye black idjut brain yer with this fist 
with these word -PRON- shake thatformidable member at the already terrify negro 
unfortunately for -PRON- dignified demeanor however the ship at the same moment give an unusually violent lurch and the old boatswain be send spin straight against the man to whom -PRON- have be hand out -PRON- admonition 
the two holder of the soup kid give vent to a howl of dismay as -PRON- see the burly form of the old sailor hurtle toward -PRON- with the speed and force of a projectile 
cuff -PRON- see long before -PRON- actually happen that a collision be inevitable unless one or the other of the negro sheer off 
hard over ye lubber -PRON- yell with -PRON- storm voice as -PRON- be pleased to call the stentorian tone with which -PRON- wasin the habit of call the watch on a rough night 
the wretched negro obey -PRON- instruction literally 
-PRON- obedience however be involuntary for the massive body of the old man reel with all the force that a fresh lurch of the plunging ship impart to -PRON- full against -PRON- 
man and soup go slide into the boiling mass of water in the lee scupper 
cuff be on -PRON- foot in a moment and stand painstakingly wipe the soup out of -PRON- grizzle whisker with one hand while -PRON- wrathfully shake the other at the two halfdrowned darkie 
bad luck to -PRON- -PRON- leatherskinne son of ham -PRON- roar

jone and -PRON- young officer be watch the scene from the forecastle head and the young commander when -PRON- have recover from -PRON- first amusement take pity on the misfortune of the two negro who have be take to sea by -PRON- from the plantaion -PRON- own in virginia in order to satisfy the craving -PRON- have express to see de mighty oshun 
many a time since tjie vengeance and -PRON- two consort have sail -PRON- have regret -PRON- rash step and now be look forward in terror to the day when -PRON- would smell powder for the first time 
as -PRON- hasten back to the galley to carry out the furious order jone hail the boatswain 
-PRON- be punish enough mr cuff -PRON- say as seriously as -PRON- could 
besides i have work on hand for -PRON- elsewhere than in the galley 
the vengeance be by this time separate from the two britistuwar vessel by a little over half a mile 
this space -PRON- be rapidly cover 
half an hour more would lay -PRON- alongside the two great craft 
jone face be light up with the eager look peculiar to -PRON- when the young commander be about to go into action 
with flash eye -PRON- feel the hilt of the magnificent sword present to -PRON- by loui of france mean to attack -PRON- ask dale or shall -PRON- try and show -PRON- a clean pair of heel jone turn on -PRON- almost angrily

but -PRON- be undoubtedly not alone the rest of the fleet be somewhere about and -PRON- would be madness to engage the entire force of the british 
-PRON- duty lie plainly before -PRON- 
dale 
will -PRON- order the signal man to inform the palla and the concord that -PRON- will engage the enemy and -PRON- blake lie aft and have the port battery clear for action 
the two officer hasten to obey 
-PRON- be none too soon to put the ship in fight trim for the next moment a puff of smoke from the side of the hindmost of the english ship and the scream of the ball as -PRON- pass over -PRON- head warn -PRON- of the hostile nature of the two stranger even if -PRON- have not be inform of -PRON- nationality by the display of the british naval flag 
shall -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON- back si ask jimmy who have get -PRON- battery in fight shape and be eager for a chance to show what -PRON- carefully train gunner could do 
not yet reply jone -PRON- would simply be waste powder and shot and -PRON- can not afford to do that 
-PRON- intend to reserve -PRON- fire then ask dale present yes 
-PRON- will wear round tothe windward of -PRON- and then show -PRON- tooth that will give -PRON- a distinct advantage 
the other nod and seem about to say something but -PRON- be interrupt by a wail of anguish from the two negro 
massa jone cry scipio be -PRON- a fac sah dat -PRON- intend to fight with -PRON- two big ship jone nod 
then fo de sake massa i have ter giv -PRON- notice an mus respectfully request tq be put on dry lan once more be afraid that be impossible scipio

as far as be possible out of sight yes sah massa jone dat be a solid fac 
then down with -PRON- into the forecastle 
this ship be no place for two such coward as -PRON- be 
dat may be true sah but i be teach by -PRON- ole mammy in good ole virginia dat -PRON- be a great deal better fo folk to say dar -PRON- go dan dar -PRON- lay 
despite -PRON- disgust jone could not refrain from laugh as the two woollyheade coward disappear down the forecastle hatch 
there be no time however to exchange word on any other topic than the business in hand 
the vengeance be now close enough to the rear frigate to read -PRON- name benbozv which be display in gorgeous scrollwork on -PRON- rounded stern 
this be the vessel command by capt hawksdale who have swear to rid the sea of jone or sink -PRON- own vessel in the attempt 
jone be well aware of thisboast for during -PRON- visit in france -PRON- have be inform of the bitter enmity the british captain cherish toward -PRON- 
as -PRON- recognize -PRON- enemys vessel the battle light come into -PRON- face 
the line about -PRON- mouth set and harden and a steely glint come into -PRON- eye 
-PRON- be the face of a fighting man 
show -PRON- the rattlesnake -PRON- order curtly and a moment later the famous standard of the coiled rattlesnake be float from the peak of the gallant yankee vessel 
the palla and -PRON- companion follow suit and a fullthroate american cheer be bear over the wave as the emblem of liberty be display 
the british vessel reply with a volley of musket ball that do no more harm than to plow up the deck 
-PRON- have the effect however of arouse the american crew to a state of fury 
the scoundrel roar old bill cuff squint along the polished barrel of the wickedlooke bow chaser 
the old man be an expert gunner and jone have intrust to -PRON- the task of wing the great threedecke frigate so that -PRON- would be at the mere of the broadside 
at last jone give the longexpecte signal 
let -PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- say to the boatswain 
cuff step back a foot or two and wait lanyard in hand till the vengeance come up on an even keel cut -PRON- maintop in half if -PRON- can cuff cried jone eagerly 
every eye on board jone vessel be on the old man as -PRON- jerk the lanyard 
the gun speak and the deadly missile screech through the air 
the ball speed through the rigging of the britisher and part some of -PRON- maintop hamper but the spar -PRON- be untouched 
miss by thunder exclaimed bill wipe the smoke from -PRON- eye with the back of -PRON- hand 
at the same moment the britisher wear round an evo lution in which -PRON- be follow by -PRON- sister ship 
signal the other that -PRON- will tackle the benbow ex claim jone turn to the signal master -PRON- must hold the attention of the other threedecker while -PRON- engage 
the signal man break out the bunting and the brig and the little put -PRON- helm up and head for the consort 
jone -PRON- take the wheel of the vengeance and jam -PRON- up into the wind till -PRON- have the britisher on -PRON- weather quarter 
fortunately the vengeance be what be know to sail or as a weatherly craft and -PRON- could hug the breeze a good two point further up than the big threedecker which as be the way of -PRON- type show a wake almost as broad as a county 
the sailing quality of jone ship bring -PRON- up where -PRON- could rake -PRON- foe with deadly effect 
the young commander stand on -PRON- quarterdeck in -PRON- battlestained uniform and watch the movement of the threedecker intently through the telescope 
when the foresail of the vengeance begin to shiver as -PRON- take the wind over -PRON- bow -PRON- order -PRON- to bear down on the huge foe that be now flounder about like some agitated leviathan 
the reason of -PRON- dilemma be that -PRON- captain have attempt to follow jone evolution and have only sue ceede in get -PRON- ship into iron 
that be that -PRON- be jam up into the wind till -PRON- point right at the blow 
this have the effect of set -PRON- all aback and -PRON- lie helpless for a moment till -PRON- people could swing -PRON- great main topsail about 
jone be quick to see -PRON- advantage and act on -PRON- 
fire 
the command be pass from the poop deck to the region below where in the light of the battle lantern the crew strip to the waist and barefoote be ram home the deadly content of the starboard broadside 
a sheet of flame and smoke belch from the side and -PRON- tremble from stern to stempost as the gun discharge -PRON- deadly hail 
jone spring into the lee rig as the smoke blow out over the sea and eagerly observe the effect of -PRON- assault 
the telescope show -PRON- that -PRON- broadside have severely cripple the britisher but owe to the great height of -PRON- side the shot have for the most part strike -PRON- too low to inflict as much damage as would have be the case have -PRON- be rake along the deck 
-PRON- be at this moment that the accident dale have dread take place 
as the yankee ship after pour in the broadside be put before the wflnd the main topmast backstay part with the report of a cannon 
instantly the sail tear the spar of the main topmast clean out of -PRON- stepping and in a moment everything aloft be in a terrible muddle 
the man at the helm let -PRON- pay off in order to save the foremast for have that spar part -PRON- would have be at the mercy of -PRON- foe as much as if -PRON- be aboard a helpless wreck 
the moment be the opportunity for which the benboiv have be wait 
at the same time as jone ship have meet with -PRON- disaster the british ship have be ease and -PRON- prune broadside now threaten the brave little vengeance 
a perfect volcano break from -PRON- three gun tier and the deck of the yankee ship be sweep as though by a tornado under the storm of shell and grapeshot that hurtle about -PRON- 
the little craft be riddle from stem to stern and -PRON- rig cut to shred by the chain shoot with which some of the british gun have be load 
the already strain mast snap like wooden knit6 te needle as the stay part and the fall timber and block convert the deck already strew with the dead and die into a veritable shamble 
amid the confusion jone and dale with jimmy and old bill cuff alone remain calm 
the scene be enough to try the nerve of the brave 
everywhere man be die or dead 
the vessel which but a moment before have be as stanch a craft as sail the sea be convert into a mere dismantle hull at the mercy of the britisher to do as -PRON- will with 
get together all the man -PRON- can be jone first order and cut away all this hamper 
-PRON- ainot much good muttered old bill cuff as -PRON- sound -PRON- boatswain pipe to which however not more than a dozen man answer -PRON- be as good as dead already 
after the mass of rig and spar that have float alongside have be cut away by the crew axe the vessel be find to be fast sinking 
at the same moment jimmy utter a cry and point to the threedecker 
-PRON- have go about after -PRON- deadly broadside and be now bear directly down on the dismantle hull 
what can -PRON- intend to do ask dale 
if -PRON- keep on -PRON- present course that question be easily answer be jone reply 
what do that mean 
that -PRON- be go to ram -PRON- and send -PRON- to the bottom never -PRON- could not be so inhuman 
why not 
this be war and -PRON- be deal with a foe -PRON- be determined to crush out at all hazard 
-PRON- will stop at nothing to accomplish -PRON- purpose 
this be fiendish exclaimed jimmy 
be there no way -PRON- can save -PRON- if -PRON- carry out the plan -PRON- think -PRON- have 
dale ask the question 
-PRON- be a brave man as brave as could be find on the high sea but there be something terrible to -PRON- in the thought of be send to the bottom without have a chance to strike a blow in -PRON- own defense 
if -PRON- could have die fight -PRON- would have meet -PRON- death as would -PRON- two companion without a tremor 
jone think jtfor a moment -PRON- eye fix on the fast advance threedecker as -PRON- ponder 
there be a way -PRON- say at length but -PRON- be such a desperate resort that i be afraid -PRON- will not care to adopt -PRON- 
what be -PRON- 
why when the crash come -PRON- must spring into -PRON- main chain and swarm onto -PRON- deck 
-PRON- be only change -PRON- mode of death 
possibly but while there be life there be hope and i mean to make the attempt 
paul jone -PRON- be a brave man 
to avoid death 
i donot think so that be an instinct even with animal 
-PRON- must take care to keep -PRON- pistol dry for -PRON- shall have plenty of work for both -PRON- and -PRON- cutlass when -PRON- get on the british deck 
the man who remain of the crew be call aft and the plan explain to -PRON- 
-PRON- all agree to stand by -PRON- officer and fight to the death rather than be send to davy 
jone in -PRON- riddled hulk 
there be no doubt now of the plan 
straight down on the doomed yankee bear the leviathan hull of the threedecker drive at tremendous speed by -PRON- great spread of canvas 
-PRON- be draw so near by now that the man on the batter vengeance could almost hear the swish of -PRON- forefoot as -PRON- cut through the sea 
a shudder pass through more than one of the man on the bloody deck as -PRON- think that ere long the keen stem would have cut the hulk -PRON- float on sheer in half 
-PRON- be at this moment that paul jone leave the deck and disappear down the after companion 
-PRON- be not miss for several moment in the general confusion that reign at the time 
the young commander swing -PRON- easily down the companion stairway till -PRON- reach the alleyway lead to the powder magazine 
-PRON- wrench one of the smoking battle lantern from the wall and tear off a strip of -PRON- shirt wet -PRON- in a pail of water which stand near the magazine door and then spread powder on the dampen linen 
then -PRON- listen intently 
above the groan of the dying that make the ship hideous lie hear a warning cry from the deck 
the moment have come 
quickly -PRON- thrust the strip of linen which be to serve as a fuse into the flame of the lantern 
-PRON- make a capital fuse and -PRON- trust -PRON- sputter and glow into the magazine 
then -PRON- turn and run quickly to the deck 
-PRON- be not a moment too soon 
right above the smoking batter hull of the little vengeance tower the huge black shape of the threedecker 
from the low elevation of the little craft the britisher seem to tower like a mountain 
stand by cried jone as the huge sheer bow be right upon -PRON- 
stand by be echo among the devoted little yankee band 
the next moment there be a rend crash as the bowsprit of the britisher tear -PRON- way through what be leftof the top hamper 
as the bobstay of the leviathan sweep over dieir head the man on the deck of the vengeance reach up and seize -PRON- 
several of -PRON- catch the stay and hang for a moment suspend over the rend timber of the ship that have bear -PRON- so long and so faithfully ere -PRON- swarm into the main chain 
tone -PRON- make a spring for the port channel and soon join -PRON- follower in -PRON- effort to reach the deck of the big threedecker 
before the british crew which be mass on the bow of the war ship to witness the destruction of the audacious yankee be aware of what have happen jone and -PRON- man stand or -PRON- forecastle and with draw sword and pistol drive furiously at the johnny bull 
the rather stolid crew of the britisher be so completely take off -PRON- guard that -PRON- be some moment before -PRON- collect -PRON- wit sufficiently to rally and make some resistance to the bold yankee 
by this time the rest of the britisher that be to say the few that have be leave on the poop when the britisher make -PRON- swoop on the poor vengeance have rush to the aid of -PRON- comrade 
-PRON- be too late though to stop the furious swoop of the american who with paul jone wave -PRON- sword high above -PRON- head in the lead have dash right through the group on the forecastle and be now well amidship 
-PRON- cost hard fighting to gain this position and -PRON- number be sensibly decrease in the desperate sortie 
-PRON- can not hold out if -PRON- rally and attack -PRON- in a body dale be say when -PRON- word be cut short by a roar that seem to rend the very sky 
at the same moment there be a blind flash of light as if a thunderbolt have be launch in -PRON- midst and -PRON- be throw flat on -PRON- face by some superlative force 
at the same time the entire forward part of the british war ship be hoist skyward and the air be dark with the rain of shatter timber and dismember human body 
as soon as -PRON- be able after the shock the american struggle to -PRON- foot and gaze about -PRON- daze for a moment at the suddenness of the whole affair 
dale be the first to guess what have happen 
-PRON- fire the magazine of the vengeance -PRON- say to jone 
the young commodore nod 
there be a look of triumph on -PRON- face as -PRON- do so 
-PRON- plan bad succeed beyond -PRON- wildest expectation 
of -PRON- late enemy not more than half a dozen remain and these be huddle forward in a frightened group eye the yankee as if -PRON- be some sort of supernatural being 
-PRON- offer no resistance to jone when -PRON- order -PRON- to be imprison in the forward deckhouse but huddle into -PRON- prison like a herd of frightened sheep 
the smoke hang so heavily over the scene that jone be unable despite -PRON- anxiety to see how the palla and -PRON- consort be fare 
suddenly through the dense fog of powder fume a voice sound 
vast -PRON- british lubber -PRON- hail 
by heaven -PRON- have tackle a genuine yankee sailor this trip and if -PRON- come one step nearer blow some of -PRON- to kingdom come 
the voice have a familiar ring 
-PRON- be that of old bill cuff 
in the excitement of the moment no one have miss -PRON- and -PRON- fill -PRON- heart with joy to think that -PRON- old shipmate be safe and sound 
-PRON- hail -PRON- back and in another moment -PRON- be all shake hand on the battlescarred deck of the britisher 
a puff of wind send the smoke which have hang over -PRON- till now like a pall stream out to leeward 
at what be reveal when -PRON- full vision be restore to -PRON- every man on that deck give a cry 
the sea be within a few foot of the vessel main deck 
-PRON- be evident that the ship be take on water fast and have only a short time to live 
-PRON- be in the most desperate situation that can confront a mariner 
paul jone and -PRON- man be alone on the shatter deck of a sink ship 
anxiously -PRON- cast -PRON- gaze about the ship 
-PRON- vigilance be barren of result however for -PRON- boat hang shatter in the davit 
jone cast a sweeping glance about -PRON- 
down to windward hang a heavy cloud of smoke 
in the midst of -PRON- -PRON- could not doubt be the two remain ship of -PRON- squadron 
what -PRON- fate be the cloud of battle do not enable -PRON- to ascertain but -PRON- have every confidence in commander crawford and biddle and know that -PRON- be give a good account of -PRON- 
although the situation do indeed seem hopeless jone be not the man to let the grass grow under -PRON- foot 
at any time and particularly in moment that would have seem to other man -PRON- last -PRON- bold spirit rise to the emergency and have many time turn defeat into victory 
there be no boat as -PRON- see -PRON- say turn to dale 
no be the reply -PRON- seem -PRON- doom be seal 
not at all 
there be still a chance chance 
yes though -PRON- have no boat -PRON- can build a raft stout enough to hold -PRON- till either the palla or the concord see -PRON- and pick -PRON- up 
this put new hope into the little party and -PRON- set to work to collect a number of plank that seem suitable for -PRON- purpose 
these be lash as securely as -PRON- time limit would allow to a number of empty barrel which would give the raft buoyancy in the water 
-PRON- preparation complete jone throw in a keg of water and a bag of hard sea biscuit 
-PRON- would have stock -PRON- frail craft with more water for -PRON- do not know how long -PRON- may be before -PRON- be pick up but time press 
the last preparation be barely complete when the ship give a sicken lurch 
for a brief second those on board think that -PRON- last moment have come but with a brave effort the die ship right -PRON- 
-PRON- be now so deep in the water that to launch the raft over the side be an easy matter 
a faint cheer rang out from the yankee as the wretched contrivance slip into the water -PRON- be very faint though for not a man who step aboard -PRON- but realize that -PRON- may be go to -PRON- death 
as -PRON- shove off from the side of the sink ship dale cast a swift glance round the horizon 
far to windward there be a faint outline of purple mist lie like a veil over the blue water 
the first luff gaze at this for some moment with a troubled expression on -PRON- face 
-PRON- seem that -PRON- scent trouble in the dim filmy mass 
if -PRON- do however -PRON- say nothing to -PRON- companion none of whom seem to have notice the appearance that have cause a shadow to rest on -PRON- brow 
at this moment -PRON- reflection be cut short by a wild cry from the deckhouse of the sink ship 
-PRON- have forget the imprison british sailor 
-PRON- plea to be take off be pitiful 
without a moment hesitation jone who have the key of the place plunge into the sea 
with swift strong stroke -PRON- have reach the side of the sinking britisher almost before -PRON- companion have have time to guess what -PRON- be about to attempt 
seize a dangle piece of rope -PRON- swing -PRON- easily to the deserted deck and race for the deckhouse 
the cry of the poor creature within be pitiful 
shoot -PRON- if -PRON- will -PRON- cry but for pitys sake do not leave -PRON- to drown like rat in a trap come to save -PRON- cry joneg as -PRON- turn the key and fling the door back 
the deck be tremble with the vessel last throe as the man rush out 
swim for -PRON- life for the raft shout jone -PRON- be go down 
-PRON- all plunge into the water and make for the raft 
all that be but some half dozen who be unable to swim 
one of these a fairhaire young fellow of slender build jone help to the raft 
this man be the only one -PRON- be able to save 
the other sink like lead after a few struggle 
pull for all -PRON- be worth or -PRON- shall be catch in the undertow cry dale as soon as -PRON- leader and the rescue man be safe on board a sink ship create a whirlpool into which everything afloat in -PRON- immediate neighborhood be draw admonition be timely 
as -PRON- speak the stern of the threedecker raise high in the air and then with a noise like the rend apart of huge timber -PRON- sink forever 
those on the raft have little time to watch the spectacle for -PRON- be keep busy scull -PRON- out of the undertow 
the man whom jone have rescue gaze at the sinking derelict with horrified eye 
but for -PRON- -PRON- say to jone should be go to -PRON- grave with the other poor fellow 
who be i to thank for -PRON- rescue -PRON- name be paul jone be the quiet reply 
the fellow start back as if strike by lightning 
paul jone -PRON- exclaim 
why -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- kill every englishman and give no quarter to -PRON- foe 
-PRON- give quarter but -PRON- never ask -PRON- be the curt reply 
speak like the brave man i now believe -PRON- be 
i be the second lieutenant of yon illfated craft -PRON- name be charle harkness at -PRON- service capt jone and can i ever reciprocate -PRON- noble act i will do so 
thank -PRON- say jone be sure that -PRON- will 
-PRON- be interrupt by a cry from dale who for some time past have not remove -PRON- eye from the filmy cloud that have first attract -PRON- attention when -PRON- be put off from the ship 
the fog -PRON- cry 
unless -PRON- can make the palla or the concord before -PRON- be on -PRON- -PRON- be lose 
there be a note in -PRON- tone that give no doubt of the seriousness of -PRON- position 
the man pull with all -PRON- strength for the two vessel which be still fight the other britisher 
the raft be a clumsy contrivance however and despite -PRON- effort the fog curtain roll over the darken sea toward -PRON- till -PRON- be wrap in -PRON- soft impenetrable fold 
a -PRON- be a situation fill with horror 
-PRON- have no compass and even if -PRON- have one -PRON- would have be useless to -PRON- in the surround gloom 
occasionally -PRON- could catch the distant boom of gun which tell -PRON- in a vague way the whereabout of the other two vessel but although -PRON- pull through the dense mist as -PRON- judge in the right direction -PRON- could not seem to get any nearer 
unless the fog lift -PRON- have to face a situation that be unparalleled for sheer hopelessness 
-PRON- raft be ofthe frail and even with the great economy -PRON- slend stock of provision would not last -PRON- more than a day at most 
-PRON- shout with all the strength of -PRON- lung in the effort to attract some attention but no answer come to -PRON- hail 
at length the sound of firing begin to grow fainter and -PRON- be compel to acknowledge although the realization bring with -PRON- a chill that -PRON- be adrift on the unknown with the vessel that may have give -PRON- aid rapidly bear away from -PRON- 
what make -PRON- hard to bear be the thought that assistance have -PRON- be able to signal be so near at hand 
suddenly from out of the fog a voice answer -PRON- hail 
if -PRON- be english for de sake be mussiful an pick up two distressed mariner -PRON- moan 
another voice come from the same direction as the first chime in with -PRON- never do have no use for dat ere paul jone 
-PRON- be genlemen an prisoner till -PRON- be blow up 
now -PRON- dunno if -PRON- be alive or jes color angel 
despite -PRON- terrible situation not a man aboard the raft could forbear smile as -PRON- recognize the voice of scipio and cato have forget -PRON- exclaim jone 
well i be glad -PRON- be safe and sound for have -PRON- be sink in the vengeance i should never have forgive -PRON- 
a rift in the fog reveal to the man the raft two woolly head bob side by side up and down on the swell and hold tight to a float chicken coop 
loud ducking from the interior of the latter show -PRON- to be occupy 
the negro be soon haul on board to the intense disgust of old bill cuff who opine that there wassomethe not just all right about people who could emerge from an explosion like that of the magazine of the vengeance without further hurt than a little singed wool and a bad fright -PRON- drift helplessly about till the fade light tell -PRON- that night be come on 
with the coming of darkness a low moaning wind spring up and the sea begin to roll in a wav that make the wretched collection of plank and barrel creak ominously 
what if the raft should part 
dale whisper to jimmy 
-PRON- should have to trust tc luck to get -PRON- out of -PRON- reply jimmy 
there be another peril -PRON- shall have to face even if -PRON- do escape from the raft what be that 
why -PRON- know these water be alive with british vessel and i suspect that the two -PRON- encounter be simply straggler from the main body 
-PRON- position would indeed be serious if -PRON- fall into the hand of the british 
especially if -PRON- find out that -PRON- have sink one of -PRON- fine ship 
see 
-PRON- look as if this measly fog be go to lift at last 
the rise wind have indeed drive away the fog mass in heavy swirl of vapor that stream far out to leeward like strip of veil 
from behind the driving mass a sickly moon shine out and feebly illumine the heaving waste of water 
the man on the raft gaze eagerly about 
toward every point of the compass -PRON- look 
the result be bitter disappointment 
not a trace of a sail be to be see 
as far as the eye could reach the sea be empty save for the frail and hurriedly put together raft that float a mere speck on the desert of water with -PRON- burden of humanity 
jone approach dale old friend -PRON- say -PRON- have need of all -PRON- courage now for this ip something very different from the excite inent of battle 
true -PRON- mean day and perhaps week of impotent suffering 
day perhaps -PRON- forget that -PRON- can not by any possibility survive for more than a week 
trite and even then -PRON- will not dwell on -PRON- but hope for the good 
now some have well lie down and try to sleep 
the man on the raft lie down on -PRON- frail support of plank and close -PRON- eye 
not one of -PRON- sleep however 
-PRON- thought be busy with various thing far remove from the waste of deserted water that surround -PRON- 
toward morning slumber mercifully visit some of -PRON- 
when dale awake -PRON- see 
jone stand by a make shift mast -PRON- and old cuff have rig up with the aid of one of the oar 
the young commander be eagerly gaze all about -PRON- 
the eastern horizon be dye a delicate pink with the first heral ding of the come day and under the fresh light of dawn the heave desert of salt water show as desolate as though the keel of man have never plow -PRON- 
-PRON- see nothing sir ask dale 
jone shake -PRON- head 
the moaning of one of the man who have be wound strike on -PRON- ear 
water water -PRON- moan 
jone nod with a significant look at the tiny keg of the precious fluid dale know what -PRON- mean at once 
there be hardly enough water to last -PRON- the day 
jone stoop over the wounded man and let -PRON- drink -PRON- fill 
-PRON- be later in the day that the other arouse -PRON- for -PRON- all feel that -PRON- be well to drowse away the hour till -PRON- should be rescue than to suffer the agony of wake suspense 
toward noon jone make a distribution of biscuit and water 
-PRON- eat and drink with avidity 
-PRON- be hour since any of -PRON- have do either 
as the sun rise higher the glare from the water dazzle -PRON- eye and the heat increase till some of the sailor begin to clamor for more water 
man say jone address -PRON- -PRON- be sll in a terrible position and whether -PRON- shall ever get out of -PRON- i know not 
that be in the hand of providence 
of one thing however i can assure -PRON- the first man catch steal ater will be shoot 
that be all -PRON- say but -PRON- have the effect of calm the man down and -PRON- endure in silence till sunset when a second distribution be make 
jone -PRON- take less than anyone 
the british officer notice this and offer to forego -PRON- own share but jone would not hear of -PRON- 
-PRON- be about midnight when jimmv arise from a trou bleed sleep and gaze about -PRON- make out a form by the water cask ri -PRON- be one of the rescue british sailor and -PRON- be in the act of repay -PRON- savior by filch from -PRON- scanty supply of water 
jimmy be on -PRON- in an instant 
a quick backward wrench of -PRON- hand send the fellow sprawling 
-PRON- be up in a minute though and jimmy catch the gleam of a knife in -PRON- hand as -PRON- come at -PRON- 
there be no time for the young ensign to draw -PRON- weapon 
the only thing to do be to grapple with the man 
as -PRON- close jimmy feel a sharp pain in -PRON- shoulder as though a redhot iron have be plunge into -PRON- 
the britisher have use -PRON- steel to good effect 
but -PRON- have not calculate on the strength of the young american 
with all -PRON- might jimmy grasp the man wrist and bend -PRON- slowly back till -PRON- be on -PRON- knee 
then drop that knife 
the blade ring to the deck 
now look here say jimmy to -PRON- now helpless antagonist will spare -PRON- life this time but if ever -PRON- attempt such a thing again i shall shoot -PRON- like the dog -PRON- be 
the fellow answer not a word but slink over to the side of the raft on which -PRON- companion lie and be soon wrap in apparent slumber 
jimmy examine the spigot of the water keg 
-PRON- turn -PRON- slightly so as to see if the british sailor have tamper with -PRON- 
as -PRON- hand meet the spigot -PRON- hear a loud shout behind -PRON- 
-PRON- be the man -PRON- have just wrest the knife from 
the young ensign be about to order the fellow away when -PRON- shout at the top of -PRON- voice here -PRON- be 
here be the fellow who steal the water while -PRON- be asleep 
in a second everyone on the raft be wide awake and jimmy face a score of accuse eye 
even jone be tempt for a moment to believe in the young ensign guilt but one glance into the lad face and the ring of -PRON- voice as -PRON- exclaim a lie convince jone that -PRON- young ensign be guiltless of the base act of which -PRON- be accuse 
what have -PRON- to say about this -PRON- demand sternly of the english sailor a sinisterlooke fellow the low part of whose face be envelop in a huge red beard 
-PRON- small eye dance with hatred -PRON- point at jimmy as -PRON- reply see -PRON- do -PRON- 
a sensation run through the man on the raft 
if a trusted officer be to be detect in the act of steal some of the precious water in whom could -PRON- place any reliance 
jimmy say jone sorrowfully be afraid -PRON- look pretty black against -PRON- -PRON- boy 
-PRON- know when -PRON- all awake -PRON- be by the keg and be in the act of turn the spigot

capt jone exclaim the young ensign -PRON- be make a horrible mistake 
surely surely -PRON- can not think that i have do this thing 
jimmy boy -PRON- look black against -PRON-

-PRON- could not trust -PRON- to speak 
deep confidence as -PRON- have in the lad -PRON- could not doubt but that torture by the thirst that be begin to torment -PRON- all the expowd monkey have be unable to resist the craving 
jimmy bury -PRON- face in -PRON- hand donot mind the penalty commander -PRON- say bitterly for if -PRON- doubt -PRON- there be not much use in -PRON- living but -PRON- should know that i be not a liar 
jimmy -PRON- would all be too glad to believe -PRON- but what be -PRON- do by that water keg 
that i have tell -PRON- once 
that be all the explanation -PRON- have to offer -PRON- be 
the english sailor break into a brutal laugh 
-PRON- voting life will be snuff out anyhow -PRON- remark to a comrade near -PRON- 
not just yet say a clear ringing voice as lieut 
harkness stride up to jone 
all stare at the english officer sudden interruption 
jone look at -PRON- interrogatively 
-PRON- have evidence point to the guilty party -PRON- ask

who be -PRON- there -PRON- stand the britisher point to the sailor who have accuse jimmy 
why do yen not speak before do not dream that matter be go to turn out so seriously besides be unwilling to see a countryman convict of such a base act but i be force to believe the evidence of -PRON- own eye when i see that man drink e from the spigot of the water butt 
a terrible change have come over the face of the bearded sailor as -PRON- officer have speak 
-PRON- florid feature be overspread with a sickly gray 
jone speak to -PRON- sharply 
come here 
the fellow shuffle over to the young commander 
what have -PRON- to say to this charge a lie 
the tone in which -PRON- say -PRON- be enough to convict the man of falsehood but jone let -PRON- go a little further 
-PRON- mean -PRON- be not at the water keg at all that be what i mean yes do not believe -PRON- 
there be stain of water on the front of -PRON- shirt 
the fellow look down in terror 
yes there -PRON- be beyond a doubt 
several wet stain of the water that have dribble from -PRON- mouth as -PRON- drink and -PRON- make a damn piece of evidence against -PRON- 
jone face grow hard as steel as -PRON- look at the cringing creature before -PRON- 
-PRON- hate a sneak and above a sneak -PRON- abhor a liar 
the man who face -PRON- be both 
-PRON- turn to jimmy 
give -PRON- -PRON- pistol 
jimmy blanched 
the fate -PRON- would not have hesitate to face -PRON- -PRON- could not bear to be instrumental in bring on another 
jone see -PRON- hesitation 
come jimmy -PRON- say -PRON- can not save the man by refuse -PRON- -PRON- weapon 
but -PRON- surely do not mean to shoot -PRON- 
as if -PRON- be a dog 
do -PRON- think of the life that depend on that water when -PRON- try to steal -PRON- jimmy be force to admit the justice of jone argu ment 
without another word -PRON- hand -PRON- the pistol 
jone point -PRON- at the shrink wretch in front of -PRON- 
if youliave anything to say speak now -PRON- say 
the sailor break into a torrent of blasphemy 
jone check -PRON- 
do not revile in -PRON- last moment -PRON- say 
the only answer be another burst of profanity then before jone could put -PRON- on guard the frenzied man leap full at -PRON- and bury -PRON- finger in -PRON- throat 
if i be to die by heaven -PRON- go with -PRON- lie shriek in the tone of a madman 
the fury of -PRON- assault send jone stagger backward toward the edge of the raft 
in another moment -PRON- be both struggle in the water 
there be an old saying that there be no enemy as dan gerous as a desperate coward 
jone struggle with all -PRON- might to free -PRON- but the fellow finger sunk deeper into -PRON- flesh 
-PRON- feel -PRON- sense leave -PRON- as completely exhaust -PRON- make a last effort to wrest -PRON- from the madman grasp 
for the first few second after the two man have go over the side jimmy and the other have stand paralyzed with amazement at the affair 
as the young ensign see the difficulty -PRON- commander be in however -PRON- require only the work of a moment for -PRON- to plunge into the water to the rescue 
-PRON- throw -PRON- arm about the throat of jone assailant as the latter be about to sink for the last time and force -PRON- back 
as -PRON- head be wrench round the fellow release -PRON- death grip on jone throat and turn -PRON- attention to jimmy do for -PRON- anyway -PRON- pup -PRON- hiss as -PRON- strive to grasp the boy windpipe i3 but jimmy be on -PRON- guard 
-PRON- force -PRON- arm under the other chin and together -PRON- sink 
jimmy be too experience a hand in the water not to have take a good lungful of air before -PRON- go under 
the other however have not and when -PRON- once more shoot to the surface jimmy feel the form of the treacherous fellow limp in -PRON- arm 
-PRON- feel -PRON- heart 
-PRON- have stop beat 
the man lip too be blue about the comer 
-PRON- be dead beyond a doubt 
nevertheless the man on the raft work over -PRON- to try and fan some faint spark of vitality to life but at the end of an hour -PRON- see that -PRON- effort be useless 
-PRON- be sundown of -PRON- second day on the raft that -PRON- consign the body to the deep 
shortly after -PRON- take -PRON- last drink from the keg and eat the last biscuit 
if help do not come shortly -PRON- be doom man 
all that night -PRON- sit up on -PRON- frail float platform and some of -PRON- pray that aid would come before death claim -PRON- 
dawn however show -PRON- the same monotonous level of rolling water without a sail to break the loneliness of the heaving waste 
-PRON- speak but little 
man in -PRON- position have little to say for each be busy with -PRON- own thought 
the wounded man groan in -PRON- pain and implore -PRON- to give -PRON- a drop of water to moisten -PRON- parched throat 
-PRON- dare not tell -PRON- that the water be all go but with the strange intuition that come sometimes to the dying -PRON- sit upright and point -PRON- finger at the keg scream -PRON- have drink -PRON- all -PRON- curse thief 
-PRON- mean to leave -PRON- to die without a drop to ease -PRON- last hour 
-PRON- be terrible to hear -PRON- raving as -PRON- call down curse on the head of the man who as -PRON- think have deprive -PRON- of -PRON- share of the precious fluid 
at last lie raise -PRON- up and try to drag -PRON- wounded body to the keg 
the effort be too much for -PRON- and -PRON- fall exhausted halfway 
-PRON- let -PRON- lie there until jone see -PRON- position and tenderly lift -PRON- back onto the pile of canvas that serve -PRON- as a pillow 
toward evening a tiny cloud appear on the horizon 
-PRON- spread with the rapidity of an ink spot on blot paper and soon the whole heaven be overcast with a sooty pall of dark cloud 
the castaway hail this with expression of thankfulness 
-PRON- mean the one thing that may yet save -PRON- livesrain 
presently a few heavy drop fall 
-PRON- turn -PRON- face with -PRON- mouth open eagerly up to the sky that -PRON- may not miss a drop of the bless moisture -PRON- must catch some of this downpour and save -PRON- say tone who realize that -PRON- may still have many day of suffering to face ere a ship or death put an end to -PRON- misery 
the canvas from beneath the wound man head be spread so as to catch as much of the rain as possible 
-PRON- leak like a sieve and when the shower cease only a few minute after -PRON- have begin there be not more than a quart of dirty water to show for -PRON- pain 
one of the sailor step up to jone 
be -PRON- go to serve out that water now sir -PRON- ask respectfully enough yet with a note in -PRON- voice that jone do not like 
-PRON- know well enough that this be to be keep for that poor fellow -PRON- say indicate the die man who have cry so beseechingly for water that day 
what -PRON- donot get none of -PRON- 
not a drop -PRON- man 
the sailor turn without a word and join -PRON- mate 
-PRON- talk together for a while in low tone 
evdn in situation such as that in which the castaway find -PRON- man will form into clique 
this be for various reason on land but among seaman there be the line that be draw between forecastle and quarterdeck that nothing not pven the prospect of a terrible death can eliminate 
so -PRON- be that the british officer be in the group comprising jone and -PRON- twoofficer not forget old bill cuff who hold -PRON- to be the equal of any quarterdeck pacer 
the crew on the other hand form a little body of -PRON- own 
-PRON- outnumber the officer two to one and be equally well armed 
mark -PRON- word captain those fellow mean mischief say dale turn to jone 
jone eye snap as -PRON- reply well if -PRON- think -PRON- be go to put tongue to that poor fellow water -PRON- be much mistaken mischief or no mischief be with -PRON- capt jone in this say the britisher hope that the fact that i be -PRON- prisoner will not prevent -PRON- from let -PRON- draw -PRON- sword on -PRON- side if -PRON- come to a tussle 
not at all reply jone 
if -PRON- do indeed intend to mutiny every sword -PRON- have will improve -PRON- chance of beat -PRON- off 
at last the sailor who have approach jone before de tache -PRON- from -PRON- fellow and once more approach the commodore 
-PRON- and -PRON- mate have be talk this thing over -PRON- say and -PRON- have decide that the living have more right to the water than a fellow what canot last more than a few hour anyway 
despite the veiled threat in the man manner jone do not lose -PRON- temper 
surely -PRON- would not have -PRON- pass -PRON- last hour torture by the agony of thirst -PRON- ask 
-PRON- donot know nothing about that 
-PRON- want -PRON- right 
well what do -PRON- wish -PRON- to do 
jone be spar for time 
-PRON- see as soon as the man speak that -PRON- be in for a fight and every moment -PRON- could avert -PRON- while -PRON- decide on some plan of action would be to -PRON- advantage 
the man leer at -PRON- insolently 
all the conventionality that mark the quarterdeck intercourse between officer and man be at an end now 
the two group of man be alone on a deserted sea on a tiny and frail raft 
-PRON- be reduce to the situation of the primitive man to whom the battle for the necessity of life be a daily occurrence 
well do -PRON- get the water 
no ypu donot question and answer rang out sharp as rifle shot 
well -PRON- mean to have -PRON- in spite of -PRON- capt paul jone 
the young commander fist shoot out like a flash and the sailor who have address -PRON- be stretch on the flooring of the raft 
-PRON- mate utter a growl of rage as -PRON- advance threateningly toward the group of officer i 
-PRON- have draw -PRON- sea knife and cutlass and present a formidable appearance compare to the group of officer who await -PRON- come calmly 
the man whom jone have knock down lay like a stone as -PRON- have fall 
this put one of -PRON- foe out of the way 
hold on man cry dale raise -PRON- hand to com mand attention have -PRON- consider what -PRON- be about to do 
this be mutiny on the high sea 
-PRON- canot frighten -PRON- with -PRON- threat growl one of the seamen not on -PRON- cursed quarterdeck now but here as man to man -PRON- mean to drive -PRON- into the sea if -PRON- donot get that water 
well then -PRON- can try to drive -PRON- into the sea but i give -PRON- fair warning that if -PRON- attack -PRON- -PRON- will show -PRON- no mercy say jone 
the man make a concerted rush at these word 
the man who have address jone rush straight at -PRON- and aim a savage sweep of -PRON- great cutless at the young commander head 
jone blow and lunging run the fellow clean through the body 
at the same moment harkness the british officer ac count for another sword be knock out of -PRON- hand and the young ensign would have fare ijadly if -PRON- have not be for old bill cuff who seize the fellow who have strike the blow by the throat and hurl -PRON- into the sea as if -PRON- have be a stone 
then the fighting grow so fast that none of the participant have time to observe the movement of the other 
-PRON- be cut and thrust for dear life 
the young britisher be wound but fight doggedly on with the courage of -PRON- race and old cuff have get a slash over the arm 
on the other hand -PRON- have account for fully half -PRON- opponent and now the officer be evenly match 
slowly -PRON- drive the mutineer back to the edge of the raft the man make a desperate sortie but -PRON- heart be go and -PRON- lose two of -PRON- number in the assault 
at last -PRON- throw down -PRON- arm and call for quarter 
jone and -PRON- officer have win 
at that moment jimmy exclaim look 
-PRON- follow -PRON- gaze and see on the horizon a white sail 
-PRON- be as yet only hull down but at the pace -PRON- be come -PRON- soon make out that -PRON- carry royal and double spencer and be a craft of great speed 
as -PRON- draw near -PRON- reveal a double row of black andwhite port and a line of bright copper be a war ship exclaim dale

-PRON- all lean forward to catch -PRON- word 
-PRON- be -PRON- majestys harpy and there on the horizon if -PRON- eye do not deceive -PRON- be two corvette and a brig of the same service

the sloop be round to and bring up with beautiful precision within a cable length of the raft 
a boat be lower and come fly through the water toward the castaway

the face of capt grimstone grow purple with rage at the calm tone of the man -PRON- be endeavor to bully 
very well sir if -PRON- do not choose to answer -PRON- question -PRON- be under no obligation to do so 
but i give -PRON- fair warning that i shall hold -PRON- equally free and order -PRON- hang at sunrise 
paul jone regard the man opposite -PRON- with steadfast gaze

then may that not be -PRON- boat the captain shake -PRON- head 
so far as i can see -PRON- be a britisher

cheer boy 
cheer for all -PRON- be worth -PRON- cry turn to the crew 
paul jone be safe and in yond boat 
a deafening break from the throat of the man at the news that -PRON- beloved commander be safe 
surely no boat be ever lower more briskly than the one that drop from the side of the palla a moment after capt crawford have recognize the young leader of the american navy 
half an hour later jone with -PRON- officer be seat in the wardroom of the palla narrate -PRON- experience with the british and receive the congratulation of high and low 
-PRON- have only drift in the boat for a day and that -PRON- have be pick up so quickly by the pallas be ac count for by the fact that the american ship have spend the time since the suppose loss of -PRON- commodore in cruise about the neighboring ocean in the hope that -PRON- may find some trace of -PRON- fate 
the day be one of general rejoicing

-PRON- account serve to fan the flame of the men hatred for the british and not a soul before the mast on either of the yankee ship but be eager to tackle the king fleet once more 
jone and -PRON- officer have decide after a consultation to head for the coast of france 
-PRON- know that the british fleet be somewhere between -PRON- and the land of gaul but -PRON- trust to the nimbleness of -PRON- wit to escape -PRON- 
from where -PRON- now lay -PRON- be a sail provide the wind hold fair of only a few day before -PRON- could reach the french coast 
to reach america on the other hand would take some week 
as -PRON- be absolutely necessary to refit -PRON- craft -PRON- be decide to run into some port on the west coast of france 
a course be accordingly lay and a few day later -PRON- enter the channel 
the english channel be at that time as -PRON- be at the present day one of the most thoroughly patrol piece of water in the world 
the yankee commander hardly expect to gpt through without encounter some british ship do police work but -PRON- hope to get by through the exercise of -PRON- native wit 
during a calm which fall when -PRON- be still some three hundred mile wet of the scilly island the man be set to work paint out the port on the side of the two yankee ship and muss up -PRON- run gear and generally smart appearance till -PRON- look like two tired old geordie home from a cruise to the west indie

from topmast to kelson -PRON- speak of discipline 
there be write to the eye of the sailor in every halyard and in the graceful set of -PRON- mast

jone wave -PRON- hand in true geordie fashion to signify that iff would obey and the topsail be swing round till the pallas be stationary 
the concord follow suit and soon the two vessel be as motionless as the frigate 
a boat come skim over the wave and a dandy young officer step superciliously up in the stem sheet -PRON- gangway -PRON- man -PRON- ask sharply -PRON- see the ladder ask jone that good enough for -PRON- -PRON- man

dale seem to be greatly pleased at -PRON- commander communication and slap -PRON- knee as -PRON- exclaim capital 
the very thing 
-PRON- spend some time at the mouth of the river lie in near the bank where -PRON- be certain of not be observe and watch the light flit over the water as the ship boat pull from one vessel of the fleet to another 
-PRON- find that the observation of the number of ship in the squadron -PRON- have make from the hill be correct 
hello say jone suddenly point to a small sloopsofwar that lie moored dose inshore that fellow have a familiar look to -PRON-

this be capt chance to get even with -PRON- for spoil -PRON- hang remark jone with a laugh as -PRON- pull back to the pallas 
may heaven grant that -PRON- disappoint -PRON- all once more say dale 
the rest of the time till midnight be spend by the yankee in transfer bag of some substance which -PRON- handle with the great care and barrel of tar and piece of canvas to the abandon schooner 
tn fact by the time the tide begin to turn -PRON- have stow away a regular cargo on -PRON- 
at midnight the tide be high and the schooner which have be fit with sail and be paint up till -PRON- look like a war ship begin to glide slowly down the river 
but one man stand on -PRON- deck 
the night be too dark to reveal -PRON- feature but -PRON- evidently be under no apprehension of the british for -PRON- loll at the wheel as the ship slide along with as much nonchalance as if -PRON- have be steer a load of garden stuff to market instead of pilot a ship down a river the mouth of which be police by the british patrol fleet a keen observer would have notice however that -PRON- do not as be the custom among sailor smoke anything 
instead -PRON- hum a tune of old virginia and the water lap against the dingy side of the rickety old craft -PRON- steer be the accompaniment 
close behind the refit schooner creep the palla and the and the big bellow 
the former be slightly in the lead 
as the man on the schooner come within sight of the british vessel -PRON- drop -PRON- nonchalant air and run swiftly forward to the stem of -PRON- old craft 
-PRON- disappear down the forescuttle from which a faint glow be presently visible 
the next moment -PRON- reappear and run swiftly to the stern plunge overboard 
-PRON- swam to the bellona whose sail have be noiselessly lower through greased fall and clamber on board by the main chain 
thank god -PRON- be back safe captain exclaim dale as -PRON- wring the hand of -PRON- commander for the man who have pilot the mysterious schooner down the river be none other than paul jone the man the british have dub the tiger of the atlantic 
thank -PRON- dale -PRON- say as -PRON- shake the water out of -PRON- clothe and now to put the second part of -PRON- plot into execution 
s as -PRON- speak there be a burst of flame from the bow of the schooner and the loud report of a gun 
how do -PRON- arrange the lanyard of the gun ask dale in amazement at the firing of the gun from the now desert schooner 
by tie a piece of rope yarn to the lanyard and the rope attach a piece of rock and throw the whole thing over the side 
when the rock in trail along the bottom strike a submerged obstacle -PRON- jerk the lanyard and fire the gun the report of the cannon have set the british fleet in an uproar 
the sitting of battle lantern about -PRON- deck show the active preparation -PRON- be make to meet paul jone for -PRON- do not doubt that the schooner be one of -PRON- fleet 
in the meantime the craft that have cause all the excitement drift silently on until -PRON- be almost abreast of the big threedecker 
then -PRON- be see to change -PRON- course and run right in between two of -PRON- because of the peculiarity of the tide 
the britisher be take aback by such boldness but -PRON- salute -PRON- with a broadside that seem as if -PRON- would blow -PRON- out of the water 
-PRON- keep right on however and before the two bulky ship could get way on -PRON- -PRON- have lock yard with -PRON- 
at the same moment a tongue of livid flame creep from -PRON- hold and lick hungrily at the mast 
then the truth burst on the british 
-PRON- be lock inextricably with a fireship 
hardly a second elapse from the time the first bluish flame have creep from the hold full of tar and oil the fireship carry before great yellow sheet of fire be shoot high into the air 
the british fight like demon to shove off from -PRON- deadly foe but -PRON- spar be already on fire and the man be leap overboard in wild terror 
high and high shoot the flame and the roar of the fierce volcano could be hear as far as the town 
the glare light up the sea as by day and in the midst of the panic that have fall on the british the sea eagle make -PRON- swoop 
out from the mouth of th river dash -PRON- three vessel 
before the british know what be happen -PRON- be upon -PRON- and hurl -PRON- deadly iron rain right and leave

the explosion send a perfect rain of flame ember and redhot bolt over the rest of the vessel 
jone ship be undamage for before go into action the sail and spar have be thoroughly wet down to avoid -PRON- catch fire from the blaze rain 
-PRON- be far otherwise with the british however 
-PRON- ship catch on fire in a dozen place at once and -PRON- crew have to leave the gun to fight the flame that threaten to destroy -PRON- 
in the thick of the inferno of flame and noise and smoke one of the great threedecker the one that have bepn undamage drift down on jone ship and open a grueling fire on -PRON- 
on the other side be jone old enemy the harpy

from both side the iron hail be hurl into -PRON- ship till -PRON- seem -PRON- must be tear apart 
the night be light up by the wild light of the burn ship and never do battlefield more resemble the infernal region than do the scene about the three vessel that lie lock together and fight handtohand 
man strip to the waist and stain with blood and powder man the gun with a frenzy bom of the desperate nature of the fight 
from time to time a man fall at -PRON- gun with the rammer in -PRON- hand and in a moment another would have snatch -PRON- up and prod the charge home 
the deck be slippery with blood and dim with smoke 
the acrid reek of burn powder be thick over everything and the smoke from the burn ship dim men eye and choke -PRON- throat 
in the midst of this inferno while the cannon belch -PRON- deadly content a chance bullet shoot down the coiled rattlesnake flag of america from the peak of the bellona 
-PRON- be paul jone -PRON- who snatch up the fall flag and springing into the shroud amid a hailstorm of bullet fasten -PRON- once more to the halyard and run -PRON- aloft 
a cheer break from the tired man at the gun as -PRON- witness the heroic deed of -PRON- young leader 
the sight of the gallant flag once more wave amid the thickhanging smoke lend the yankee fresh courage

if -PRON- donot live up to instruction that first check will be the last one leave the rest of -PRON- money to charity some home for superannuated miner and prospector if there be any such thing have thirty day to spend a hundred thousand dollar 
show -PRON- how -PRON- do -PRON- 
everybody say -PRON- be a great spender but i never learn the knack 
i stakin -PRON- to a round of pleasure now go out and make a business of bein happy want -PRON- to be a gentleman about -PRON- i know -PRON- be an honest soul and that -PRON- have a lot of fine sensibility inherit from -PRON- mother 
-PRON- pa be short of ability as a moneymaker and some other thing but -PRON- get an a inheritance of character from the squander that money in a genteel way but donot let one sou of -PRON- make anything through investment 
report to -PRON- often in person or by letter -PRON- see fm aimin to spend -PRON- last day enjoyin -PRON- experience 
i never be able to get any fun out of the money -PRON- so fm plannin to take -PRON- fun secondhand 
make -PRON- snappy and if -PRON- throw in a few thrill -PRON- will oblige 
when a man be packin for -PRON- trip across the great divide same as -PRON- a leetle excitement will make -PRON- forget the trip ahead of -PRON- and be as -PRON- may say soothin 
as fm prepare to lay down life i want -PRON- to pick -PRON- up real life mind the kind miss 
i faintly somewhere within the confine of the board house there sound the musical note of a triangle 
uncle wes stir restlessly go the supper call -PRON- say 
hopper charge four bit a meal for transient like right well to have -PRON- stay and eat with -PRON- but fm short four bit in change 
if -PRON- happen to have -PRON- havenot a red uncle wes put in whipple but -PRON- credit be good at the fordham 
-PRON- credit ought to be good anywhere with that paper i just give -PRON- but the bank be closed and hopper want cash on the nail 
maybe -PRON- would better go to the fordham when the bank open -PRON- can begin to step high wide and handsome 
i only wish i be able to trot along with -PRON- but -PRON- all i can do to walk from this porch to the dinin room 
this heart of mine wonot let -PRON- exercise 
help -PRON- downstairs and then -PRON- can go to -PRON- hotel and plan -PRON- campaign 
if -PRON- put away a dollar of that money where -PRON- bring any interest remember -PRON- be do 
whipple catch -PRON- breath once more 
-PRON- be hardly able to realize -PRON- good fortune 
as one in a wake dream -PRON- help uncle wes out of the canvas chair into the board house and down the stair to the door of the dining room 
there -PRON- thank -PRON- mechanically leave -PRON- and drift out into the bright beautiful afternoon 
one hundred thousand dollar all -PRON- own 
whipple be so daze by -PRON- all that -PRON- barely miss be run down by a street car in washington street 
a whipple come into the lobby of the hotel fordham five man arise from -PRON- chair and advanced upon -PRON- 
-PRON- have learn -PRON- be in town and each have a bill 
one hundred dollar would pay every cent that whipple owe and while that be a large amount to an amalgamator earn thirty a week and with a thousand way in which to lay out that meager stipend -PRON- be a mere bagatelle to a young croesus upon whom have devolve the pleasant duty of spend more than three thousand dollar a day for thirty day 
whipple drop into a chair while -PRON- creditor surround -PRON- and hold out -PRON- statement of account 
sway by a spirit of mischief whipple mutely pull -PRON- pocket inside out 
gentleman -PRON- say come into town with thirty dollar and -PRON- be all go 
five face grow very long and then come some peppery comment 
whipple allow this to continue until -PRON- get on -PRON- nerve then with a flourish -PRON- bring out -PRON- certify check and hold -PRON- under five pair of pop eye 
however -PRON- go on tomorrow as soon as the bank open i shall have the money 
spread the good news that monte cristo junior will be at hotel fordham at eleven oclock tomorrow morning load to the guard with mazuma and ready to meet all comer with a claim on -PRON- 
money have a magic touch 
long face broadened and sour look fade into genial smile 
the man the haberdasher the jeweler who have overhaul watch 
coffee of the shortorder cafe and the garage proprietor with a bill for taxi all these nearly smother whipple with -PRON- kindly attention 
one hundred thousand dollar 
the good will mount in a direct ratio with the size of the check reach height that whipple find rather annoying 
-PRON- be know to be a good spender whenever -PRON- have the cash or if -PRON- do not have the ready money wherever -PRON- credit be good 
but the limit of cash and credit for a amalgamator be modest 
the wealthy wesley plunkett because of -PRON- know character as a tightwad never have influence the merchant in put whipple on -PRON- book 
now that have loosen in such a royal manner however every tradesman have cheerful glimpse of the nephew in the role of a princely spendthrift and -PRON- begin lay -PRON- plan accordingly 
wrench -PRON- clear of the enthusiastic group whipple go in to dinner 
every one even the waiter have a smile and a nod for -PRON- 
news of the cleck be travel like wildfire 
-PRON- hardly seem possible that old plunk have reverse -PRON- so magnificently but every one who smile and nod have see some one who have see somebody else who have feast -PRON- eye on that oblong square of negotiable certify paper 
so the check be a fact and the quick way to get a little of money be to be on a friendly footing with lucky nephew 
later in the evening whipple find time to do a little sober thinking 
in order to be completely strap by next may fourteenth -PRON- would be necessary for -PRON- to spend three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollar every day 
and -PRON- could make no investment all the money would have to go for a good time a period of pleasure snappy and full of thrill if the approval of uncle wes be to be win 
the problem when consider at some length give whipple a sink sensation 
on one evening the previous fall -PRON- have spend fifteen dollar and forty cent 
this madden round of pleasure have include taxicab hire a picture show a dance and then a little supper and katie mingo have be -PRON- companion 
-PRON- have give that jamboree all the trimming -PRON- could imagine even buy katie a bunch of flower and a box of chocolate 
-PRON- have consider -PRON- a wonderful plunge and -PRON- recall how katie have gently reprove -PRON- for -PRON- extravagance 
but that fifteen forty wasnot a circumstance to the obligation that face -PRON- now 
how in sam hill be -PRON- go to spend more than three thousand dollar a day for the next thirty day 
-PRON- canot be do -PRON- tell -PRON- gloomily 
all the pleasure i know anything about wouldnot cost -PRON- three thousand a month in this man town 
like many another man whipple have often dream of the fun -PRON- would have if some kindhearte genie would toss a million dollar into -PRON- lap 
now face with cold fact -PRON- couldnot devise way and mean for get rid of one tenth of a million 
-PRON- need help 
in a flash of inspiration -PRON- think of concho charley vandeever 
by george that be an idea vandeever be an oldtime friend of and -PRON- proud boast be that -PRON- never have anything more than a stetson on -PRON- mind 
charley van be a cowboy 
an aunt in the east have die and leave -PRON- four thousand dollar 
the moment -PRON- get the money charley van have excuse -PRON- from the ranch and in just ten day -PRON- be back at the tumbling punching cow again flat broke 
that feat of concho have go down in the history of the cattle country as a performance never before equal -PRON- have even be perpetuate in a song entitle charley and the wad that wilt and so have be embalm for all time as a lesson to spendthrift 
as soon as -PRON- could get to a telegraph office whipple send the following message mark -PRON- rush charley vandeevef tumbling ranch prescott arizona 
get to get rid of one hundred thousand dollar in thirty day 
come on and help 
at the rate of four thousand dollar in ten day supreme effort would have amount to only twelve thousand dollar in a month 
if that be the good -PRON- could do then whipple be lean on a broken reed 
nevertheless -PRON- have confidence in charley van 
-PRON- experience would be valuable and there be no tell what prodigal height -PRON- may not attain if back with unlimited fund 
the nimble fancy of a free range would suggest way and mean for pleasure not to be find within the four wall of a gold mill 
two head be well than one in the emergency anyhow and there be nothing in uncle instruction bar an assistant spender 
whipple go to bed that night in a fairly comfortable frame of mind 
next morning at ten oclock -PRON- deposit -PRON- check in a checking account and draw three thousand three hundred and thirtythree dollar and thirtyfour cent 
-PRON- would try -PRON- prentice hand at get rid of -PRON- before midnight 
charley van could not possibly connect with the telegram and reach the side of -PRON- hardpressed friend before some time the follow day meanwhile whipple could experiment unaide with -PRON- latent power as a spendthrift 
-PRON- have a chance to begin just as -PRON- turn from the pay teller window 
hello call a voice 
put er there son be trail around for two hour try to find -PRON- 
congratulation a chunky man in a shiny prince albert coat a slouch hat and trouser bag at the knee stand in front of whipple and hold out -PRON- hand 
-PRON- be middleage have gray chin whisker and wear a pair of large tortoiseshell glass 
this person have the look of an amiable owl and -PRON- advance be more than friendly 
doc flickinger exclaim whipple take the hand 
erasmus flickinger by special appointment at cut rate physician in ordinary to that doomed and unhappy man -PRON- uncle 
still cling to hand flickinger pull -PRON- close and whisper in -PRON- ear miss -PRON- but hopper eh 
well such be life and -PRON- never know what minute be go to be the next 
auricle and ventricle all shoot to piece and now there s a valvular lesion 
july fifteenth along about three in the afternoon i should say will tell the story 
how about a commission commission echo whipple free -PRON- and draw back to look full at the sure go on flickinger always customary 
if i hadnot give -PRON- three month -PRON- wouldnot be pull down a hundred thousand a month the source of -PRON- good luck 
ten per cent all right 
-PRON- be bark up the wrong tree flickinger reply whipple coldly not hand anybody an honorarium for give -PRON- uncle bad news 
make -PRON- one per cent then beg flickinger 
all i can pry out of old plunk be fifty cent a call 
even -PRON- up for -PRON- 
just a measly thousand for shake this plum tree for -PRON- 
fifty cent a call be about half a dollar more than -PRON- call be worth 
not a cent flickinger 
this demand of -PRON- be bad than unprofessional -PRON- an attempt holdup 
with that whipple push on out of the bank 
-PRON- have no confidence in erasmus flickinger even though -PRON- have develop some success as a prognosticator in a patient length of day 
-PRON- gorge rise at the brazen demand for a commission on the misfortune of uncle wes but out of -PRON- indignation there come an idea 
make -PRON- way to the telegraph office -PRON- proceed to wire five hundred dollar to doctor mixinger of prescott and request -PRON- immediate attention in the matter of wesley plunkett five hundred dollar plus telegraph toll make cheer inroad upon the necessary disbursement of the day and whipple could not have spend the money for anything that would have contribute more to -PRON- personal pleasure 
on -PRON- way back to the hotel attention be arrest by the fact that all phoenix seem to know of -PRON- good fortune 
somehow -PRON- have get into the morning paper 
-PRON- buy one cross over to the courthouse plaza seat -PRON- on a bench and read the racy account of what must have strike the townspeople as a sevenday wonder 
the heading run whipple from threeply strike -PRON- rich 
young amalgamator at mine ride into phoenix and drop into a fortune 
easy come easy go be the string to -PRON- 
and uncle wes hold the end of the string 
there on -PRON- bench in the plaza whipple lean back in the shade of an oleander and smile a little 
be -PRON- become famous or notorious 
-PRON- wonder and then continue to read wesley whipple more power to -PRON- open hand be say to be a spender 
well have now the chance of a lifetime to prove -PRON- 
-PRON- must spend one hundred thousand dollar a month for the next two month solely for -PRON- own pleasure and without make any investment that may bring money return and then if -PRON- measure up to expectation there will be another hundred thousand dollar for -PRON- to put in the bank and draw on only as -PRON- need -PRON- for living expense 
query will -PRON- develop such prodigal habit during the two month that -PRON- third hundred thousand will take wing and finally leave -PRON- strand in mill with only -PRON- salary as amalgamator for a stake in life 
the experiment will be watch with interest by the many friend of in this town 
-PRON- appear that -PRON- wealthy townsman have discover that -PRON- have only three month to live 
mr as all know be an old prospector of frugal habit who turn up a fortune when -PRON- discover and sell the famous letty lee mine in the harqua hala 
ever since that time ten year ago -PRON- have be in fail health 
-PRON- declare that -PRON- know how to save money but have never acquire the knack of spend -PRON- for -PRON- own comfort and pleasure 
so as -PRON- day draw toward a close -PRON- turn -PRON- wealth over to -PRON- nephew in liberal monthly installment to be spend at the rate of more than three thousand dollar a day in the quest of joy and happiness 
and mr whose eccentricity be well know assert that by this method -PRON- will be secure thrill and excitement by watch -PRON- nephew riot away a fortune must be flat broke at the end of -PRON- thirty day if -PRON- be not the deal be off and -PRON- will not receive the second stake for another jamboree of thirty day 
and -PRON- can not invest in anything that will bring monetary return every red cent -PRON- disburse must go for comfort and pleasure and the question naturally arise how may a man of ingrained habit base upon the spending of a hundred or so a month blossom out as the regal spender of a hundred thousand a month 
-PRON- look easy but be -PRON- as easy as -PRON- look 
-PRON- extend -PRON- condolence to mr and to -PRON- nephew mr whipple also unless -PRON- can prove as the spendthrift day go on that -PRON- be entitle to congratulation 
whipple be laugh at this story in the paper when -PRON- look up to see a young man stand in front of -PRON- 
mr wesley whipple inquire the stranger nick -PRON- be carter wainwright of the ne plus ultra sale company mr whipple get a lot of money to spend and the right way to begin be by buy a ne plus ultra automobile 
-PRON- will set -PRON- back twentyfive hundred dollar but will give -PRON- twentyfive thousand dollar worth of pleasure 
six other automobile salesman be wait for -PRON- at the hotel but i have steal a march on -PRON- by overhaul -PRON- in the plaza 
now the ne plus ultra be the classy car on the market today 
-PRON- come equip with cord tire have all right mr wainwright cut in whipple take one -PRON- charge -PRON- more by throw in a few extra 
possibly 
come over to the salesroom and well fix -PRON- up 
by george enthuse mr wainwright this be the easy and quick sale make since be in the business -PRON- catch -PRON- at what -PRON- call the psychological moment be comment 
-PRON- arise from the bench the salesman hook an arm through -PRON- and -PRON- start for the place where the ne plus ultra be to be have superintendent at the mine have a ne plus ultra car and whipple have a turn for mechanic have repair -PRON- and tinker with -PRON- and drive -PRON- until there be nothing about the ne plus ultra with which -PRON- be not thoroughly familiar 
so -PRON- drive -PRON- shiny new machine back to the fordham and leave -PRON- out in front while -PRON- go into the hotel and become involved in the design of a greedy mob that fill the lobby and have be wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- single out -PRON- creditor and pay -PRON- off 
three gambler lead by montgomery king otherwise monte -PRON- summarily dismiss with the emphatic declaration that -PRON- be out to get a run for -PRON- money and not to enrich the card sharp 
mogollon mike moloney a povertystricken prospector whom h have know for year and who at that moment be particularly down on -PRON- luck -PRON- present with fifty dollar 
four mining broker with good thing in which -PRON- want to interest -PRON- have -PRON- ardor dampen by the statement that -PRON- wasnot allow to invest a point -PRON- would not have miss if -PRON- have read the morning paper carefully

by the time -PRON- have finish -PRON- noon meal another crowd have gather in the lobby each member of -PRON- prime with suggestion for help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- hundred thousand 
evade these caller -PRON- dodge out at a side door reach -PRON- wait automobile with a rush and a jump kick at the selfstarter let in the clutch and be off for a ride through the countryside 
the car work like a charm and just to handle the control and realize that everything from the headlight forward to the tail light aft be -PRON- very own cause -PRON- the most delightful sensation 
-PRON- afternoon spin carry -PRON- out along the cave creek road around by the indian school and then back to town again 
if only katie or mamie or lorena have be with -PRON- -PRON- enjoyment would have be complete 
but which one of the three would -PRON- have enjoy most to have along 
ordinarily -PRON- answer would have be katie but pa hard jolt over the phone have rather daze and discourage -PRON- so far as katie be concern 
and mamie philbrick have turn -PRON- down courteously but not with any regret that -PRON- have be able to discover 
miss lorena marlin have be out of town 
in the absence of any disconcert word from miss marlin -PRON- rather guess that -PRON- would have enjoy most -PRON- company on the little afternoon spin 
in the lobby of the fordham the rank of those with design on -PRON- money have be reenforce by several newspaper man who be look for a story 
-PRON- refuse -PRON- to all of -PRON- after felix vannell have catch -PRON- ear and pour into -PRON- the information that three lady be in the parlor upstairs wait to see -PRON- 
the wide door of the parlor hang with portiere open at the head of the first flight 
as whipple come close to one of the swinging curtain a voice that be very familiar strike on -PRON- ear know -PRON- first and -PRON- s -PRON- by the right of discovery 
-PRON- two may as well be on -PRON- way 
that be lorena marlin speaking 
-PRON- gurgle musical voice which have always seem so cute and childlike to whipple have lose some of -PRON- rich cadence and be tinge with temper 
-PRON- stop to debate with -PRON- and more conversation drift out to -PRON- 
-PRON- may have know -PRON- first miss marlin but when -PRON- call up last night and -PRON- have serena haskin tell -PRON- -PRON- be out of town i guess that let -PRON- out 
oh i get wise to that 
wesley will feel fine when -PRON- hear -PRON- be in the board house all the time and didnot want to see -PRON- 
well miss smarty since -PRON- know so much tell -PRON- something that be wise to 
-PRON- phone to -PRON- yesterday didnot -PRON- 
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have another engagement but -PRON- never have any caller and werenot out of the house all evening 
so i guess be even 
whipple be terribly shake by this cross fire between lorena marlin and miss mamie philbrick 
-PRON- have no business stand there and listen to -PRON- but -PRON- could hardly have avoid hearing disclosure 
be these girl like all the other 
have wesley whipple become popular with -PRON- merely because of the hundred thousand dollar 
-PRON- draw out -PRON- handkerchief and pass -PRON- over -PRON- moist brow think -PRON- be just horrid both of -PRON- 
here come a third voice equally familiar to whipple but vastly more pleasing 
katie mingo be speak 
-PRON- tone express indignation and there be nothing in -PRON- of a spiteful quality 
whipple clutch at -PRON- as at a straw of hope 
a mocking laugh greet word horrid be -PRON- return lorena marlin 
well how have -PRON- father be talk about wes whipple these last few week

step lightly -PRON- dear step lightly whipple think -PRON- be high time to appear on the scene 
-PRON- cough fling back -PRON- shoulder and show -PRON- between the portiere 
a cry of delight welcome -PRON- and lorena and mamie spring up from -PRON- chair and hurry forward 
katie remain seat by a window and do not join in the demonstration 
lorena have black hair and black eye and katie have flaxen hair and blue eye while mamie be neither a brunette nor a blonde 
all be lovely of feature and form but a flash of revelation have show whipple that the character of at least two of -PRON- be not so lovely 
-PRON- bow in -PRON- good manner 
congrat wes cry lorena put out -PRON- hand always think -PRON- uncle would do something for -PRON- wes mamie remark and isnot -PRON- fine how be -PRON- make -PRON- make -PRON- fly whipple answer

whipple could have make these statement of fact very cutting but -PRON- be not in -PRON- to be disagreeable to the lady 
-PRON- smile as -PRON- speak 
so -PRON- go on be sure -PRON- will not be very much disappointed if i tell -PRON- that i have other plan for this evening 
-PRON- walk over to katie 
miss mingo -PRON- inquire why arenot -PRON- congratulate -PRON- think wait answer katie 
the truth be i donot know whether -PRON- be to be congratulate or not 
time will tell about that wes 
if the paper be to be believe the condition under which -PRON- uncle be give -PRON- the money may prove a handicap in the long run 
father want -PRON- to come to dinner at -PRON- house this evening 
then -PRON- have reverse -PRON- 
-PRON- opinion about -PRON- have undergo a change since uncle wes prove so liberal 
mamie and lorena titter fair face flush painfully 
whipple be sorry at once that -PRON- have speak in just that way 
before katie could answer -PRON- go on suppose -PRON- take a ride in -PRON- new car and talk -PRON- over 
just out around camelback mountain get -PRON- home in time for supper 
-PRON- offer -PRON- arm 
katie arise put -PRON- hand through the arm and cross with whipple to the wide doorway 
mamie have lose the power of speech and have drop into a chair 
not so lorena -PRON- seat -PRON- quickly at a piano thrum a few note and begin to sing 
-PRON- voice follow katie and whipple as -PRON- descend the stair katie be wait at the door 
oh dear gasp katie in charming confusion 
never mind say whipple cheerily 
-PRON- be a little hard to find out who -PRON- real friend be sometimes especially -PRON- add when one happen to have a hundred thousand dollar to spend 
that money of uncle be go to prove a great education to -PRON- 
-PRON- have a wonderful ride and not the least wonderful part of -PRON- be explanation of the way -PRON- father have reverse -PRON- sentiment be never -PRON- -PRON- tell whipple earnestly know -PRON- have always think well of -PRON- but -PRON- have have such hard luck all -PRON- life that -PRON- canot bear to see any one squander money 
and -PRON- have be in debt so much -PRON- that -PRON- fill -PRON- with horror to see a young man start life as -PRON- say completely surround with bill 
-PRON- have watch -PRON- carefully for the last three year ever since -PRON- begin call at -PRON- house 
-PRON- -PRON- didnot seem to improve wes and so -PRON- take the stand -PRON- do 
after -PRON- talk with -PRON- i try hard to get -PRON- at the hotel -PRON- but couldnot 
now worried for fear -PRON- will think like lorena and mamie invite -PRON- to dinner because -PRON- have suddenly come into a lot of money 
no katie never think that of -PRON- whipple aver never forget how i spend fifteen dollar and forty cent once and -PRON- call -PRON- down for be so extravagant

-PRON- isnot right to throw away so much money 
-PRON- be almost six oclock when whipple halt the car in front of door let katie out and then drive on toward the hotel 
galusha mingo meet -PRON- daughter as -PRON- enter the house 
-PRON- wouldnot come to dinner -PRON- ask 
no father answer katie brightly 
-PRON- tell -PRON- what i want 
yes -PRON- answer dutifully 
galusha mingo rub -PRON- hand 
then -PRON- have plant the seed and -PRON- will grow and bear flower and fruit -PRON- dear 
-PRON- shall see what -PRON- shall see 
while -PRON- be utter this oraculaf comment whipple be just cross the street car track to drive into a garage 
-PRON- work of driving be purely mechanical for -PRON- thought be all about katie and the delightful two hour -PRON- have just spend with -PRON- 
-PRON- do not hear the jangled warning of an approach street car and the first -PRON- know of -PRON- danger be a tremendous crash 
one side of the ne plus ultra double up and wreck and break -PRON- be roll and push along the track 
whipple -PRON- have be throw through the wind shield by the impact and be lie crumple and unconscious in the street in front of the garage 
-PRON- have all happen so quickly that even the crowd on the sidewalk be slow in realize that there have be an accident 
a awoke to find -PRON- lyvv e on three chair in a drug store 
doc flickinger be bend over -PRON- 
both arm and one foot have be bandage and flickinger be now decorate -PRON- face with courtplaster 
get out -PRON- say to flickinger 
fm all right remark flickinger to the druggist and the druggist two clerk 
as near as i can make out -PRON- s get a compound fracture of the tibia lacerated ligament of both arm and very grave internal injury 
call the ambulance and well send -PRON- to a hospital 
no -PRON- donot cry whipple stay at the fordham and that s where go right now 
with that -PRON- get off the three chair and start for the door 
although -PRON- limp wesley whipple walk remarkably well for a man with a compound fracture of the tibia 
flickinger chase after -PRON- wildly but -PRON- brace -PRON- in the doorway turn and shake a bandaged fist under nose have some internal and external injury -PRON- if -PRON- try to trail after -PRON- -PRON- threaten 
flickinger be intimidate and fall back 
hatless coatless bandage and wear only one shoe whipple turn a corner and walk half a block to the hotel fordham 
the usual crowd of schemer be lie in wait for -PRON- but the sight of whipple in this gruesome condition be discourage and only felix vannell and the chinese bell hop accost -PRON- 
for the love o pete exclaim the clerk the matter accident say whipple but -PRON- isnot as bad as -PRON- look 
want a doctor 
no all i want be to get up to -PRON- room 
the chinaman help -PRON- get -PRON- to -PRON- room on the second floor and would have continue -PRON- ministration have whipple not order -PRON- out 
then whipple lock the door and proceed to remove the bandage 
there be absolutely no need of -PRON- so far as whipple could discover 
the compound fracture and the lacerate ligament so feelingly mention by doc flickinger be wholly imaginary 
whipple kick the bandage into one corner of the room and air -PRON- opinion of flickinger in burn word 
-PRON- realize that -PRON- be shake and bruise and that the glass of the broken wind shield make necessary the three bit of courtplaster that decorate -PRON- face 
aside from this however -PRON- have suffer no injury 
be an athletic person and hard as nail as the saying be -PRON- have come through that accident remarkably well 
a hand try the knob of -PRON- door then the same hand drum a summon on the panel 
-PRON- be vannell and -PRON- bring a coat hat and the miss shoe 
these be just bring to the office -PRON- explain shy fiftyeight dollar and a quarter felix say whipple 
see if -PRON- in the coat 
-PRON- be not in the coat and whipple be force to the conclusion that when -PRON- be throw from the car -PRON- must have empty -PRON- pocket into the street 
-PRON- still have -PRON- watch and chain and the rabbit foot charm and for these and for -PRON- wonderful good luck -PRON- be very thankful 
vannell report that the car be a total wreck that brandnew ne plus ultra which whipple have own and enjoy for only a few fleeting hour 
but the situation have -PRON- amenity 
whipple be clean out of every cent of the money which -PRON- have draw for the day spending 
-PRON- laugh jubilantly while the clerk look on and wonclere if -PRON- be right in -PRON- mind 
in half an hour felix whipple instruct send -PRON- dinner up to -PRON- room the clerk retire and whipple lock -PRON- in again then -PRON- take a hot bath and greatly refresh crawl into bed 
when -PRON- dinner come -PRON- eat with a heartiness that in no way suggest the invalid 
about eight oclock vannell bring -PRON- an evening paper and two telegram 
the clerk be off duty and would have like to sit down and talk but whipple make -PRON- plain that -PRON- be in no mood for company lot of people have call up and ask about -PRON- say vannell galusha mingo among other 
mingo give order that -PRON- be not to be disturb and inform -PRON- that -PRON- be in charge of -PRON- case 
that all right -PRON- be pleasant to know that father be take such an interest in -PRON- 
whipple inform the clerk that -PRON- be all right and be once more left to -PRON- 
one telegram be from doctor mixinger will run down friday and give -PRON- uncle -PRON- good attention 
the other message be from charley van have be send collect and be charge against whipple on the book of the hotel get -PRON- pard go out and take a view of the universe spend a red till i get there and show -PRON- how 
will arrive thursday a m 
whipple go to sleep that night feel splendidly but -PRON- awake next morning lame and sore and with an ache in all -PRON- joint 
-PRON- try to get up and dress but topple back into bed again 
-PRON- be bear in on -PRON- that -PRON- be doom to take a day off and that -PRON- riotous spending would have to be break for a interval 
at the end of that time however charley van would be with -PRON- in person and there would be two head to plan and four hand to scatter the largess of uncle wes 
-PRON- be a quieting thought reflection have mostly to do with katie mingo during that inactive day 
and -PRON- happen to remember that -PRON- father be in need of ten thousand dollar 
-PRON- occur to -PRON- that unknown to katie -PRON- may bestow that amount upon galusha mingo win -PRON- abide friendship and get rid of more than a three day allowance of uncle money 
galusha mingo have study for the law only to find that -PRON- could not earn -PRON- salt as a lawyer 
-PRON- have then give -PRON- attention to assaying and now have a little shop about six door from corral 
the business be not prosperous and mingo have a hard time to get along 
-PRON- be a psychologist and -PRON- bring so much of the shadowy science into -PRON- business affair that possibly the fact account for -PRON- failure 
-PRON- have the faculty nevertheless of see good thing in a business way and if -PRON- have have the fund with which to back up -PRON- analysis of opportunity -PRON- may have be a rich man 
at the present moment -PRON- be very busy with affair and oa wednesday afternoon about three oclock the angle of -PRON- activity be bring very forcibly and not very pleasantly home to the young man in room mr mingo call and with -PRON- there come a little sharpvisaged man who seem deeply interested in the state of health 
mingo introduce -PRON- companion as jule fortheringham a claim agent 
the plunge at once into the business of the interview brandnew automobile be a total wreck 
-PRON- have cost -PRON- just a few hour before the accident something like twentysix hundred dollar 
-PRON- be a miracle as -PRON- may say that whipple -PRON- have not be kill outright 
seemingly -PRON- have come off extraordinarily well 
-PRON- be feel fairly well at the moment and yet who know what may not develop in the day or week to come 
mingo have vision of whipple walk with a cane or a crutch for the rest of -PRON- life 
that be a possibility 
the claim agent recognize the possibility and -PRON- be ready to give a check for five thousand dollar part to reimburse whipple for the loss of the car and the rest to in16 sure the company against any further claim 
but i be all right assert whipple and i donot want to goldbrick anybody 
galusha mingo put up a restraining hand 
whipple think -PRON- be all right but time alone could tell whether -PRON- be or be not 
disease result from the accident may creep into -PRON- system in course of time and put -PRON- completely out of the running 
then again whipple continue to protest pm not so sure that the street car be at fault 
i galusha mingo interrupt hastily to state that there be six eyewitness who would all swear that the street car be at fault 
-PRON- be probable that heredity have less to do with this matter of be square than environment 
the child of the most honest parent in the world will be mar for life if abandon in the tender year to evil surrounding but -PRON- will grow up a credit to those who bear -PRON- if right teaching be sift into -PRON- environment with discrimination and care 
whipple in -PRON- extreme youth have be well ground in proper principle and -PRON- now rebel against the course along which mingo be hurry -PRON- donot care about -PRON- eyewitness -PRON- say know that what happen be due entirely to -PRON- own carelessness 
that settle -PRON- 
jule fortheringham push a bundle of paper with which -PRON- have be busy back into -PRON- pocket 
this frankness be er most unusual where a soulless corporation and easy money be concern -PRON- remark 
who be the old chap who go hunt with a lantern for an honest man 
-PRON- could have find -PRON- prize right here in room the fordham 
-PRON- shake hand with whipple 
son -PRON- go on as -PRON- move to the door and pause there let -PRON- tell -PRON- something -PRON- canot spend or throw away a red cent without make an investment and the return be bind to be make manifest in spite of -PRON- 
just remember that 
galusha mingo to all appearance be bitterly disappointed 
-PRON- turn on whipple the moment -PRON- be alone together and vent -PRON- feeling 
young man -PRON- say angrily -PRON- havenot an idea of the value of money 
if -PRON- ever expect to get marry what business have -PRON- get turn down a chance like that 
less to -PRON- than to the lady who will some day be mrs whipple -PRON- be under an obligation to get ahead 
on the chance that -PRON- little girl may somehow be concern in -PRON- future plan i be try to help -PRON- 
flickinger make out as good a case for -PRON- as -PRON- could -PRON- be to receive ten per cent of the gross and i certainly pull the wire for -PRON- in masterful fashion 
now -PRON- have knock everything into a cocked hat 
-PRON- start for the door 
katie be grieve over this orgy of fool spending mingo go on 
-PRON- be a woman and take to heart more than -PRON- ought to the deliberate manner in which -PRON- be shatter -PRON- future go to send -PRON- to an aunt in los angele so -PRON- wonot be anywhere near this scene of criminal extravagance 
i feel that -PRON- will be good 
-PRON- jerk the door open but before -PRON- could leave whipple stay -PRON- with a word am try to give -PRON- uncle a little excitement and a few thrill in -PRON- last day mr mingo -PRON- explain as the other turn back 
in that desk over in the corner be a check book and pen and ink 
may i trouble -PRON- to bring -PRON- to -PRON- 
mingo obeyed order and whipple write out a check to -PRON- for ten thousand dollar 
katie tell -PRON- yesterday that -PRON- be desperately in need of this amount of money whipple go on as -PRON- pass over the check and i be glad to oblige an old friend 
i would suggest however that -PRON- do not tell katie anything about -PRON- 
-PRON- may not approve 
mingo be touch almost to tear 
til give -PRON- -PRON- note -PRON- say huskily 
if -PRON- do fll tear -PRON- up 
that be a free gift 
i be empower to spend the hundred thousand in way that will bring -PRON- the most pleasure 
look at in such a way if the donation mean anything to -PRON- -PRON- mean infinitely more to -PRON- 
-PRON- whole life turn right at this point continue mingo feelingly on behalf of -PRON- family and -PRON- i thank -PRON- from -PRON- heart 
be -PRON- still of a mind to send katie to los angele 
on second thought return mingo believe leave that move to katie -PRON- 
thursday morning whipple be feel much well 
-PRON- be out of bed by seven and torture -PRON- weary muscle with settingup exercise 
the cold bath and brisk rub down that follow bring a warm glow and a feeling of exhilaration 
the complaint of -PRON- dependable nerve and sinew be very mild indeed and only just enough to remind -PRON- that -PRON- have be in a collision 
the patch of courtplaster of course still remain as souvenir 
-PRON- be busily shave when something like an avalanche bump against -PRON- lock door 
-PRON- open -PRON- and fall into the fond embrace of charley van -PRON- -PRON- old seed whoop the cowboy ready to take -PRON- little hand in -PRON- and go out and put some fancy crimp in the big wad

just long enough to get -PRON- on -PRON- foot so be patient

uncle wes go into a flurry 
-PRON- rage about the dollar and a half and the extra few cent for the stamp 
while -PRON- be rave three other bottle go over the rail 
-PRON- grab for the last one but be not quick enough 
utterly beside -PRON- with rage the old prospector jump out of -PRON- chair and begin prance up and down the veranda now and then -PRON- would pause and look over the railing and moan at the sight of the broken glass and waste medicine 
say -PRON- quaver if i have a gun i surely would doctor mixinger draw a small gleam automatic pistol from one of -PRON- pocket 
-PRON- havenot one handy -PRON- say

-PRON- grow quiet instantly and slump into -PRON- chair again 
how long have -PRON- be like this go on the doctor 
uncle wes moisten -PRON- lip with -PRON- tongue and try twice before -PRON- could answer then -PRON- manage to say ten year 
ten year lose murmured doctor mixinger and just when -PRON- ought to be in -PRON- prime 
any appetite not a particle return uncle wes -PRON- fascinate eye on the automatic which the doctor continue to hold in -PRON- hand 
all i can eat for breakfast be about six slice o bacon a couple o slab of bread three or four egg and two cup o coffee every last thing -PRON- stomachll take in the morning eat enough t keep life in a chipmunk

-PRON- and i be go to take a walk around the block 
never mind -PRON- shoe those slipper will do

go way or call the police 
i canot come on doctor eye flash and -PRON- level the automatic 
uncle wes stagger to -PRON- foot 
with the doctor right behind -PRON- -PRON- reel across the veranda and through the doorway into the hall 
brace up order the doctor 
throw -PRON- shoulder back breathe deep hang on to the banister as -PRON- go downstairs 
there that s right 
now then keep step with -PRON- 
down on the sidewalk the neighbor have a glimpse of uncle wes hatless and in -PRON- old slipper move along at the side of doctor mixinger 
josh hopper stare after the two from -PRON- front step 
-PRON- wag -PRON- head forebodingly killin -PRON- -PRON- say to -PRON- reckon i may as well call the undertaker 
this be awful as doctor mixinger and uncle wes round the block the doctor steadily increase the pace 
when -PRON- get back to front door uncle wes have to gallop to keep up but -PRON- notice as -PRON- climb the stair and return to the secondstory veranda that -PRON- be not breathe much faster than usual 
-PRON- be astound 
well remark the doctor with a laugh -PRON- didnot drop do -PRON- 
mr either flickinger have scare -PRON- or -PRON- have scare -PRON- 
-PRON- havenot any more heart trouble than i have 
what -PRON- need and all -PRON- need be exercise physical and mental 
that be -PRON- proper tonic 
forget -PRON- health take on a hobby or find some compelling purpose and follow -PRON- with all the enthusiasm -PRON- can muster 
-PRON- must have an object in life that will make -PRON- think and stir around 
then then i ainot go to die in three month ask uncle wes faint with wonder 
-PRON- be go to die in about thirty year provide -PRON- smoke less and stop dose -PRON- with those patent nostrum 
-PRON- be perfectly sound and that be quite remarkable consider the way -PRON- have coddle -PRON- for ten year 
i never see a man of -PRON- age who be potentially more capable of get the utmost out of life 
but cut loose and be active 
this be a bright and happy world and -PRON- be perfectly competent to get -PRON- full share of the brightness and happiness 
while talk the doctor have be close the little square case 
straighten -PRON- turn and hold out -PRON- hand in a friendly way be pay five hundred dollar to come here and tell -PRON- this -PRON- continue and -PRON- ought to be grateful to -PRON- nephew for -PRON- be the good advice -PRON- have ever have 
i beg -PRON- pardon for display the pistol but i think -PRON- will admit that -PRON- be a difficult case and hard to handle 
i trust there be no hard feeling 
uncle wes take the offer hand then startle by the great truth that have suddenly dawn upon -PRON- -PRON- watch wideeye while doctor mixinger vanish through the doorway 
ten o -PRON- good year plumb waste -PRON- mutter kick over the canvas chair 
run around that block without so much as ketchin -PRON- breath nothing the matter not a thing except the want of exercise 
i -PRON- break off abruptly as -PRON- eye happen to cross the veranda rail encounter doc flickinger move on the board house from up the street 
flickinger be come to make -PRON- customary morning call on uncle wes 
the eye of the old prospector narrow and -PRON- face grow hard the cimiroon that do more to make -PRON- waste -PRON- ten year than any one else on earth -PRON- growl reckon due for a little more exercise -PRON- finish and crouch beside the door lead to the secondstory veranda 
a a of shock that jar the board house from underpin to roof lift josh hopper out of -PRON- chair and carry -PRON- at a double quick to the second floor of -PRON- establishment 
mrs hopper and pedro the man of all work join -PRON- as -PRON- race 
when the three of -PRON- arrive on the upper veranda what -PRON- see make -PRON- almost doubt the evidence of -PRON- sense 
uncle wes the confirm invalid have doc flickinger flat on the porch floor and be pin -PRON- there with two knee on -PRON- chest 
in a fury uncle wes be bump head on the hard board while flickinger beg for mercy 
yes roar uncle wes feelin quite well this morning doc 
no this exercise ainot hurtin -PRON- heart a particle but seem to be right soothin 
i reckon -PRON- neednot call any more 
-PRON- see make up -PRON- mind to live thirty year instead of jest three month convalescin fast -PRON- glad to see how recuperatin under -PRON- treatment -PRON- mr and mrs hopper and pedro fling at -PRON- and with -PRON- united effort manage to heave -PRON- clear of the prostrate flickinger 
the latter bounding to -PRON- foot flee for the stair the street and safety 
-PRON- leave -PRON- hat spectacle and -PRON- medicine case behind 
uncle wes fling -PRON- after -PRON- over the railing and the medicine case jingle merrily as -PRON- strike the ground 
what on earth be the matter wailed mrs hopper hysterically 
uncle wes leap into the air and let off a whoop a well man that s what s the matter -PRON- declare come to and get wise to how flickinger be stringin -PRON- along 
that lady doc doctor sort of open -PRON- eye 
-PRON- make -PRON- do thing that flickinger say i couldnot do without passin out 
oh my gorry what a fool be 
-PRON- can have -PRON- secondstory porch hopper do with -PRON- 
-PRON- run to -PRON- room kick off -PRON- slipper and begin put on a pair of shoe 
then -PRON- get into clothe which -PRON- have make -PRON- a practice to wear only on sunday 
-PRON- have a compelling object in mind 
now that -PRON- be a healthy man with thirty good year ahead of -PRON- -PRON- realize -PRON- mistake in give the hundred thousand dollar to -PRON- nephew 
-PRON- business be to overhaul and recover as much of the money as possible 
dinner be ready by the time uncle wes be ready for the street but delay to eat while be spend with an open hand be out of the question 
uncle wes reason that the faster -PRON- hurry the more of -PRON- good money -PRON- would recover 
the sight of wesley plunkett travel at speed along the street of phoenix cause the oldtimer to rub -PRON- eye and wonder if -PRON- be see thing 
-PRON- be ten year since anything like that have happen before 
-PRON- be an incredible performance for one whose day be say to be number 
must be flighty be the general comment -PRON- ought to be capture and take back to but no one try to capture -PRON- 
there be a look in the old prospector face that warn against interference 
-PRON- come to the hotel fordham dash through the street entrance and run to the counter behind which felix vannell stand and blink -PRON- nephew demand uncle wes 
tell -PRON- here and want -PRON- pronto 
get a move on young feller because this be mighty important left here bright and early this morning mr reply the clerk 
uncle wes drop -PRON- elbow on the desk and bow -PRON- tall form across -PRON- -PRON- go -PRON- bark 
-PRON- and charley vandeever start for los angele where the chance for spend money in a big way be a lot well than -PRON- be here 
this be a terrible wrench for uncle wes 
-PRON- stifle a groan 
physically there have be a change in -PRON- a complete transformation but mentally -PRON- be the same old tightwad 
the thought that have already escape and be on -PRON- way to a big and extravagant city where the rest of the hundred thousand would melt away like dew in the morning sun be a blow between the eye 
uncle wes come out of -PRON- daze to inquire wh what train do -PRON- take 
i can overhaul -PRON- with a telegram 
hurry what train do -PRON- leave on 
and what s -PRON- do with charley vandeever think -PRON- call in vandeever to help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- money and -PRON- didnot leave by train 
-PRON- buy one of these aeroplane for sixteen thousand dollar and hire the chap that own -PRON- to take -PRON- to los angele pay that pilot a hundred dollar a day -PRON- see the paper this morning full of -PRON- 
uncle wes groan again 
-PRON- stagger 
then -PRON- think of the bank in which have deposit the money 
on a forlorn chance -PRON- go there and institute inquiry 
-PRON- be inform by the cashier that whipple have draw out all the money in -PRON- account take -PRON- in thousanddollar bill 
when -PRON- leave the bank uncle wes feel like a beaten man 
-PRON- have -PRON- health and -PRON- have a lot of money leave but -PRON- hurt -PRON- to the soul to see the remain of that hundred thousand dollar get away from -PRON- 
back at -PRON- make -PRON- plan to go to los angele by train and be there to meet and vandeever when -PRON- arrive 
hopper however explain to -PRON- that the aeroplane travel so fast that -PRON- would probably be in los angele before uncle wes could get a train out of phoenix 
uncle wes suddenly have an idea 
til send a telegram to the chief of police in los angele -PRON- say and have and vandeever arrest the minute -PRON- come down stop -PRON- 
-PRON- wonot be able to spend any money if -PRON- be in jail 
jest as soon as i learn -PRON- have be arrest go to los angele -PRON- get back what s leave of -PRON- money and tell the police to turn -PRON- loose 
-PRON- go to the courthouse and talk with the sheriff then the sheriff get busy and wire the los angele police department 
follow this there be a period of wait 
feel that -PRON- have make an excellent move uncle wes grow calm 
-PRON- read the paper and learn how accompany by the irrepressible charley vandeever have buy the aeroplane hire the pilot and take flight from the city park 
this sensation divide honor in the daily press with a big bank robbery at eudora arizona in which three bandit have make a daylight raid and escape with sixty thousand dollar in cash and liberty bond 
the bank be offer five thousand dollar for the capture of the robber and ten per cent of all cash and bond recover 
this affair interested uncle wes only because -PRON- claim the attention of the local sheriff and give -PRON- less time to devote to and vandeever 
uncle wes haunt the sheriff office wait for news of the arrest of -PRON- nephew and vandeever and make -PRON- a nuisance 
one day two day pass and still the aeroplane have not reach los angele nor have -PRON- reach any other know port of call east or west north or south 
a deep dark mystery have suddenly fall over that aeroplane 
after leave phoenix -PRON- have neither be sight nor hear of 
probably the opinion run -PRON- have be wreck somewhere on the desert or in the mountain and would never be hear of again 
then on the third day after the fly machine have leave phoenix among the suspicious character bring in by the sheriff and -PRON- posse to be question regard the eudora robbery be a weazelface know to be a side partner of the gambler threecard monte 
-PRON- tell a story after a session of the third degree that let in a flood of light on the spender bind for los angele 
monte -PRON- seem have subsidize the pilot of the aeroplane and win -PRON- consent to land -PRON- passenger on saddleback flat at the edge of the estrella mountain 
this be a lonely hole in the hill inhabit solely by scorpion tarantula and sidewinder 
but the gambler and some of -PRON- friend would be at saddleback flat if not when the aeroplane arrive at least shortly thereafter and -PRON- plan be to annex every dollar carry by and vandeever by fair mean or foul 
the discovery that monte and -PRON- confederate have leave by fast automobile in the general direction of saddleback flat the very morning the aeroplane have hop off corroborate the story tell by the informer 
deputy sheriff start at once for saddleback flat 
-PRON- refuse to let uncle wes ride in -PRON- car but -PRON- enthusiasm for an active role in recover -PRON- money spur -PRON- to hire a flivver and follow on to the flat 
galusha mingo go with -PRON- and although -PRON- be manifestly no work for a woman katie mingo insist on go with -PRON- father 
katie be wild with apprehension over and uncle wes have not the heart to insist that -PRON- stay at home especially since mingo be bear rather more than -PRON- share of the flivver hire 
this second party get away three hour after the deputy sheriff have start all be too late hazarded galusha mingo gloomily 
more than likely monte and -PRON- gang have get the money and be in part unknown by this time have a lesson mourn uncle wes hang on to -PRON- money after this and not fool -PRON- away on a spendthrift nephew 
but oh what do -PRON- suppose have happen to wail katie fret about -PRON- katie say uncle wes with whom girl be a prime favorite be back in gold mill before many day work for thirty a week as usual a after all say and do and nobody ever yet make -PRON- hard to find aeroplane have be name by percival simmon the ace high and since a hand in a poker game with nothing but ace high seldom win simmon name for -PRON- flyer be not much of a recommendation 
neither whipple nor vandeever however draw -PRON- speculation out so fine 
the former pay ten thousand and the latter six thousand and when the ace high hop off at phoenix that bright friday morning -PRON- be -PRON- property and the former owner be on -PRON- pay roll at one hundred dollar a day 
whipple have turn the balance of -PRON- bank account into cash and -PRON- have with -PRON- on take the air in -PRON- fly start for los angele seventyfive bill and a hundred plus in small change 
-PRON- be enough certainly to finance a tolerable round of pleasure for two wandering spendthrift 
the three passenger be distribute in separate cockpit along the backbone of the ace high simmon in front just back of the propeller then whipple and then vandeever 
just before the takeoff whipple have overhear simmon make inquiry about the estrella mountain and saddleback flat 
this strike -PRON- as queer and -PRON- have ask the pilot why -PRON- be so interested in that particular part of the country 
simmon answer that -PRON- merely want to use the mountain and the flat as a landmark while con -PRON- course 
whipple be surprised to discover as soon as -PRON- be in the air that -PRON- be not in the least dizzy 
there be a deafen clamor in -PRON- ear 
this be continuous and make conversation impossible 
and when -PRON- get out from behind -PRON- wind shield to look overside a frightful rush of wind tear the breath out of -PRON- lung 
but there be no unpleasant sensation and all -PRON- doubt about the aeroplane be a good buy be dissipate 
thirty minute after the start a sunbaked wilderness destitute of human life be unroll beneath the ace high at the rate of a hundred mile an hour 
whipple know that a mountainous country lie below but view from overhead -PRON- seem flat and every highflung butte and peak have no more visible elevation than a cactus clump 
simmon keep constant watch presumably look for landmark 
why this be necessary at that stage of the journey be incomprehensible to whipple 
a compass course due west be all that be need 
the pilot theless seem anxious and worried and at last confused 
-PRON- dip lower in order to get a clear view of the country and then -PRON- lift higher circle and cut figure eight mile long twist and turn and fall and rise until whipple lose all sense of direction and could only judge the way -PRON- be travel by take a slant at the sun 
charley van be likewise puzzle by these maneuver 
-PRON- lean over to yell something in ear 
after several attempt -PRON- make -PRON- manifest to whipple that -PRON- do not like the proceeding and that -PRON- be lose time with all those curlicue when -PRON- ought to be whoop -PRON- up on a straightaway course and wouldnot just yell that into simmon ear order -PRON- to point for los angele keep go and oblige 
whipple lean over -PRON- wind shield and shout at the aviator helmete head the joint objection of the two owner of the machine to the man -PRON- have hire to run -PRON- 
simmon answer something but whipple could not understand what -PRON- be 
with one hand on simmon leatherclad shoulder with the other whipple indicate a westerly direction 
the pilot nod nosed the machine skyward and start again on the proper course 
for ten minute everything go beautifully and then all at once the terrific din of the propeller fail in a swift diminuendo 
presently only the screech of the wind could be hear among the taut wire and stay 
there could be talk now that be clearly hear the idee simmon demand charley van 
engine trouble of some kind answer the pilot -PRON- hand pass swiftly over the control dead and i canot get a kick out of -PRON- 
then what inquire whipple with a sink sensation get to volplane down 
look for a place to land both of -PRON- 
if -PRON- canot find the right kind of a place be all do for 
this be pleasant news 
the ace high be corkscrew downward in wide circle and the ground below seem to be jump up at -PRON- greedy for a collision 
with wide fearful eye whipple and vandeever be try to discover a level stretch of ground among the tumbled mountain peak 
can -PRON- see anything of saddleback flat yelled simmon wildly mile to the west of -PRON- flat charley van roar at -PRON- 
the country down there look to -PRON- a heap more like the gila bend divide than the estrella 
oh by glory sim -PRON- have sure get -PRON- all mix up 
hit the flat desert canot -PRON- -PRON- canot hit anything but those peak be the pilot answer -PRON- see anything that look level and smooth down there 
use -PRON- eye 
with sicken rapidity the sawtooth crest of the hill leap at the ace high a canon cry whipple as the fly machine cut across the yawn mountain chasm at perhaps five hundred foot 
and a flat at the bottom of -PRON- add vandeever 
can -PRON- drop into that gash and light on the flat get to answer simmon between -PRON- set tooth if i donot -PRON- all over but payin the bet 
-PRON- manipulate the fall machine in such fashion that the nose of -PRON- be bring in line with the north and south trend of the canon then straighten out the plane rush downward 
-PRON- clear the two steep wall of the gash and by a turn to the left hit the flat with a shock that almost throw whipple and vandeever out of -PRON- cockpit 
the flyer lurch and wabble over the rough ground finally halt with a crash 
whipple take a header into the air land on one of the wing roll down the steep slope of -PRON- and off the end in a sixfoot fall on a nest of bowlder 
there -PRON- curl up quietly and go to sleep 
-PRON- awake to find charley van throwing water in -PRON- face 
how -PRON- feelin inquire the cowboy anxiously good deal like i do when the street car hit -PRON- answer whipple in a faint voice waste all that good water charley give -PRON- a drink 
vandeever limp away bend down over a small stream refill -PRON- stetson and come back this fierce -PRON- comment gloomily as whipple gulp the water over the hat brim reckon this deal be a mistake simmon ask whipple 
who care a hoot about sim snap vandeever 
-PRON- sell -PRON- a sky boat with a bum engine and now see what s happen 
i allow if -PRON- break -PRON- neck -PRON- wouldnot be much moren even 
no such luck come the melancholy voice of the pilot 
-PRON- be sit on a bowlder minus -PRON- helmet and leather jacket and be knot a handkerchief around -PRON- left forearm use -PRON- right hand and -PRON- tooth 
whipple have be drag clear of the rock pile and -PRON- now sit up and take a look around 
-PRON- be at the edge of a flat and the flat be at the bend of the canon 
the wall of the defile be high and straight up and dow merely smooth precipice 
a small stream babble over the rock of -PRON- narrow course and in the sandy stretch be rank growth of mesquite 
the ace high have run head on into the canon east wall 
the lefthand plane have be crumple up by a big cottonwood tree and the front end of the machine have be crush as far back as the pilot cockpit 
simmon surely have be lucky to escape alive 
think -PRON- can fix up the old catamaran sim inquire vandeever 
not hardly be the sarcastic response a total wreck 
landing gear all smash propeller all in piece port plane in smithereen and engine knock into a cocked hat 
when -PRON- get away from here well have to walk 
walk yell the exasperate vandeever 
do -PRON- know what sort of country lie between -PRON- and civilization bout steen hundred mile of desolation with nothing to feed on but chuckwalla and nothing to drink but the juice of niggerhead cactus 
walk 
man -PRON- never could make -PRON- 
if -PRON- old pop bottle have to give out why didnot -PRON- pull the play within hailin distance of phoenix an elegant mess o fish 
whipple get up and balance -PRON- dizzily on -PRON- leg look around and get -PRON- bearing -PRON- suggest something to do anyways vandeever assent 
-PRON- move northward toward the upper end of the canon 
simmon do not go with -PRON- but sit disconsolately on -PRON- bowlder and begin spiritlessly to manufacture a cigarette 
-PRON- donot need to worry a hull lot remark vandeever get -PRON- sixteen thousand so bustin up the ace high donot mean a thing in -PRON- young life 
-PRON- didnot take -PRON- long to get rid o that bunch o money anyways 
plumb waste and nothing to show for -PRON- this be a right discouragin canon if anybody ask -PRON- 
look at -PRON- wall a hundred foot straight up and even a squirrel couldnot get from here to the rim rock 
and there s the north end -PRON- be just like the side wall 
i move -PRON- take a look over south 
the north end of the canon be close by a sheer precipice 
the little stream hit the wall sink out of sight under -PRON- flow through a subterranean channel 
wait a minute call whipple halt -PRON- companion who be about to turn back this 
on the smooth surface of the end wall some hand have rudely inscribe with red pigment lose creek canon 
no chance to get out 
bottle up 
johnson blue 
vandeever read the inscription give a howl of despair and throw up -PRON- hand 
lose creek canon by glory that do settle -PRON- be plant for keep 
what do -PRON- mean charley 
whipple ask -PRON- never hear tell of johnson blue over to the no one ever mention lose creek canon around -PRON- not that i remember 
say listen 
this here be a pocket there ainot no gettin out of 
once here -PRON- be here to stay 
only -PRON- as hard to get into as -PRON- be to get out of mostly 
johnson blue get into -PRON- with rope explorin like and the rope get loose and come down on -PRON- 
a carrier pigeon -PRON- have with -PRON- get back to prescott with the news but the message be weatherbeaten and dim in spot 
the location of lose creek canon wasnot readable and people hunt for -PRON- for month hopin to save blue 
but -PRON- wasnot never save 
i reckon if -PRON- look well find what s leave o -PRON- around here somer 
vandeever take off -PRON- hat and slam -PRON- down on the rock then -PRON- lean against the sheer wall and laugh huskily and mirthlessly 
and here -PRON- and -PRON- -PRON- go on load to the brim with dinero and aimin to cut loose with -PRON- in los angele bottle up in lose creek canon without no carrier pigeon or rope or nothing j plumb cast away that s all and when be lay out cold the birdsll get -PRON- thousanddollar bill and line -PRON- nest with -PRON- 
-PRON- laugh again and the wall of the canon give back the nervewracke echo 
a north end of lose creek canon be cheerless forlorn and offer a despairing prospect but a find be make around the bend in the south end that put heart in the three castaway 
the wall here be steep and unscalable and a lofty barrier throw across the defile make of -PRON- a complete culdesac 
here lose creek find -PRON- bubble up from beneath the foot of the barrier flow the length of the canon and lose -PRON- again at the other end of that tremendous blind alley 
the surrounding south of the bend be not so depressing 
the wall be hang with trail vine which give a bowerlike aspect to that part of the mountain prison and there be a flat cover with a thick growth of oak and pinon and in the heart of this grove whipple and vandeever stumble upon -PRON- big surprise a small but comfortable log cabin 
that cabin could not have be build by johnson blue discoverer and original castaway of lose creek canon 
-PRON- be seven year accord to vandeever since home pigeon have flutter into prescott and the cabin be plainly of very recent construction 
-PRON- stand empty and deserted and there be no path lead to -PRON- door 
the door be not secure in any way but open readily to hand 
the single room within be marvelously equip for comfort 
three bunk furnish with blanket and pillow be build against the wall 
three chair stand around a small table and in a cupboard plate cup and saucer knife fork and spoon continue to carry out this remarkable grouping of three 
charley van pull off -PRON- hat and run -PRON- finger through -PRON- hair 
look like somebody have be gettin ready for -PRON- party be -PRON- comment this j nacherly rattle -PRON- spur in a second cupboard be find a bag of flour strip of hacon a box of potato and a generous supply of can good 
there be a stove too in one corner of the room with pot and pan hang all around -PRON- and even a supply of firewood pile beside -PRON- 
charley van collapse into one of the chair once say that -PRON- cup be and catch a little good luck when -PRON- rain trouble -PRON- didnot outfit -PRON- with so much as a ham sandwich when makin that start for los angele in the skyhooter so if mrs class luck hadnot drop this cabin and content down in the canon for -PRON- -PRON- would sure have starve plumb to death so new the worm havenot even get in the prune 
-PRON- can draw out the agony for quite a spell figgerin 
charley return whipple this pocket in the hill isnot so blame inaccessible as -PRON- have be try to make -PRON- believe 
somebody come here and fix up this place calculate to make a home out of -PRON- see for -PRON- vandeever return that there ainot no gettin out of here unless -PRON- sprout wing admit that hombre could come down on a rope same as johnson blue do but without that same rope gettin out be go to bother a heap 
three man build this cabin and get -PRON- ready to live in whipple go on and that wasnot so long ago because everything be fresh and new 
-PRON- must be plan to come back here very soon 
well charley when -PRON- come well use -PRON- mean for get into the canon to get out of -PRON- 
all -PRON- have to do be to wait exclaim vandeever hope toe get -PRON- chance to pull out before -PRON- thirty day be up and -PRON- be leave strand with that bundle of kale have to spend faster than i reckon on when -PRON- do hit los angele 
now bein hungry and the like o that how about gettin simmon over here 
-PRON- be braggin about how -PRON- can cook 
suppose -PRON- start -PRON- in 
all right go get -PRON- 
vandeever find simmon still sit on -PRON- bowlder very much cast down -PRON- forget be -PRON- first word to vandeever that still draw -PRON- hundred a day a mere baggytelle perce return the cowboy be -PRON- stringin -PRON- when -PRON- say -PRON- could cook a regular chef boast simmon and i be sit here think how i could eat if there be only anything eatable in sight 
well chirk up be go to feed 
come on and show -PRON- 
when the cabin and -PRON- supply burst on -PRON- vision the aviator be astound 
whipple be build a fire in the stove but vandeever pull -PRON- away from the work 
sim tell -PRON- that -PRON- expect -PRON- to pay -PRON- the hundred a day whether be flyin or lay up in this canon say vandeever 
by do the cookin and take care of the ranch i calculate that hell make all of five dollar a day anyways so i move -PRON- let -PRON- do -PRON- -PRON- and -PRON- will jest sit around and fret because the spendin be so poor 
get busy sim among the supply be two or three dozen package of cigarette several pound of smoke tobacco and half a dozen deck of card 
vandeever make these discovery and announce -PRON- joyfully -PRON- whisper to -PRON- friend with -PRON- luck at the pasteboard -PRON- will be blame little of that hundred a day ever see 
simmon prove that -PRON- be really a capable cook by prepare an excellent meal 
all be in well spirit after -PRON- have eat -PRON- dinner 
while simmon be clear away the empty dish vandeever tumble into one of the bunk for a nap and whipple roam around the flat 
-PRON- seem to whipple as though there must be some way into that canon and out of -PRON- 
the story about johnson imprisonment in that mountain pocket may be farfetche 
whipple be not so credulous as vandeever seem to be so -PRON- go hunt for a possible avenue of escape 
-PRON- fail to find -PRON- 
the wall mask with trail vine be as precipitous as the bare rock face in other part of the canon 
whipple wonder if the vine be strong enough to bear -PRON- weight 
-PRON- learn that -PRON- be not for essay a climb by mean of the festoon creeper -PRON- sustain a fall of a dozen foot and give up -PRON- attempt 
as -PRON- move around the edge of the flat -PRON- foot kick against something and -PRON- stoop and pick up a small tin box 
the box be scar and worn and lock 
-PRON- break -PRON- open 
inside of -PRON- be an openface silver watch with a leather fob and an elk tooth charm attach to -PRON- eighteen cent in change a comb and brush a pocket knife and a memorandum book 
sit down at the foot of an oak -PRON- fall to examine the various object 
on the back of the watch be the monogram the same initial be engrave on the handle of the knife 
relic of johnson blue think whipple and pick up the little book 
on the flyleaf -PRON- read this write in a firm businesslike hand johnson blue late of new york city now of nowhere in particular -PRON- impression of life base on the way in which -PRON- live -PRON- and write for -PRON- own amusement while -PRON- slowly starve to death 
this be gruesome but -PRON- hold a fascination for whipple 
blue really have be bottle up in that canon 
-PRON- have send out -PRON- carrier pigeon hope for rescue 
rescue have not come and famine have claim -PRON- for a victim 
what -PRON- get this be vandeever 
have finish -PRON- nap -PRON- have go search for whipple 
the latter tell -PRON- what -PRON- have find and how -PRON- have chance upon -PRON- 
by glory the cowboy exclaim sit down at -PRON- friend side and look with deep interest at the watch the knife the military hair brush and the comb 
eighteen cent 
-PRON- be mighty nigh bust flat wasnot -PRON- 
whipple read from the flyleaf of the book 
purty tough comment vandeever with feeling 
and -PRON- may have starve allee same as blue if somebody hadnot build that cabin for -PRON- and fill -PRON- with supply 
poor old blue 
-PRON- must a be blue -PRON- last day 
i canot imagine nothing bad than have hunger get -PRON- 
read about -PRON- impression of -PRON- whipple begin to read no help have arrive and i have come to the conviction that the carrier pigeon fail to reach prescott 
that mean that -PRON- day be number 
the chuckwalla be not very plenty and not very appetizing 
in the heyday of -PRON- wastrel year i remember how squab on toast chicken a la maryland and roast canvasback duck pal on -PRON- jaded appetite 
if i have -PRON- million back i would give all of -PRON- for one dinner at i have keep pull up -PRON- belt a notch until -PRON- make a circle no big than a dog collar and not a very large dog collar at that 
but why repine 
i have have -PRON- fling and here i be hole away among the bleak mountain with -PRON- large fortune dwindle to a pitiful eighteen cent a good exhibit in the case of gal life versus a sensible existence i be a horrible example in the matter of what not to do with a million dollar and i feel the urge to put some of -PRON- philosophy down with pen and ink 
no one will ever see -PRON- but the mere writing will be a relief to -PRON- mind and will serve to beguile this period of wait for the end 
and i have an idea that i can make -PRON- finish the fine thing i have do in all -PRON- riotous year 
gosh exclaimed vandeever as whipple pause reflectively 
now whyever do -PRON- suppose -PRON- be writin like that read on answer whipple and see if -PRON- can find out be a happy man before -PRON- uncle ezra die and leave -PRON- that million dollar in hard cash 
keep book for halloran beezley and receive a hundred dollar a month for -PRON- 
get along beautifully put aside a little every week for a rainy day and have enough leave to ride over to coney of a saturday afternoon and take some real enjoyment 
and get away to the polo ground occasionally and yell -PRON- hoarse over a good ball game 
and there be ethel 
there be fine rls in this land but none fine than ethel wish -PRON- may know what have finally happen to -PRON- but that be hardly possible 
if i have take -PRON- advice but not sob about that or anything else 
i mix this dose of medicine for -PRON- and go to swallow -PRON- with a smile 
back in the old day though i be happy 
and i didnot know -PRON- 
i live in a little paradise all -PRON- own and i be get ahead at the rate of about three hundred a year 
then a snake crawl into -PRON- paradise a snake with glitter golden scale and diamond eye uncle million dollar didnot have to work any more what i tell halloran beezley 
work be for those poor fish who have no uncle to die and leave -PRON- a million 
i start out to put some new brightness in the gay white way 
-PRON- say i make good 
i have friend everywhere and -PRON- do -PRON- good to make -PRON- forget i have ever be a bookkeeper 
be -PRON- much of a trick to run through a million in a year 
not in a town like new york wet or dry 
when a man who now and then have to walk to save car fare wake up with a million in -PRON- mitt maybe hell still walk to save car fare but i doubt -PRON- 
if -PRON- be young as i be and if -PRON- have ability as a spender as i have hell probably buy -PRON- a flock of automobile and never walk any more than -PRON- just have to 
i scatter the million in twelve month and now here be far from the bright light a prisoner in these hill and with only eighteen cent in -PRON- pocket a fine case of dyspepsia and roasted chuckwallah do not agree with a finicky stomach all rusty from lack of exercise and i come to arizona for the mountain cure everlastingly too late time i die and r vandeever reach over jerk the book from hand and throw -PRON- angrily out across the flat reckon that will be all of that -PRON- growl 
now that -PRON- get -PRON- pocket full o money i ainot in any mood to listen to such stuff 
i hadnot a notion blue be that kind of a ciiniroon 
look like -PRON- be hit at -PRON- eh charley query whipple tell a man and -PRON- ainot a fair go either 
why inmlaze do -PRON- have to kick that tin box out o the brush but blue wasnot the same as -PRON- in -PRON- uncle contract that -PRON- get to spend 
blue wasnot oblige to do what -PRON- do 
-PRON- be go on -PRON- own when -PRON- get down to -PRON- eighteen cent some people plumb foolish 
whipple and vandeever at the foot of the oak in lose creek canon sit brood in deep thought over the foolishness of johnson blue 
what angle be take by -PRON- vagrant thought be no matter but presently the cowboy get up walk sheepishly over to the little book and pick -PRON- up and dust -PRON- off 
take care of -PRON- -PRON- say hand the melancholy record to -PRON- friend 
like enough after all -PRON- and -PRON- will get eighteen cent worth o fun out o readin -PRON- 
if -PRON- go into -PRON- spendin habit maybe there will be a tip for -PRON- when -PRON- get to lo have to work fast if be hold up here for much of a spell 
a little book of johnson wield an uncanny influence 
two day after -PRON- have be find all three young man in the canon have come under -PRON- mystic spell 
when whipple be not read -PRON- aloud to -PRON- companion either vandeever or simmon be sure to have -PRON- and to be deeply immersed in -PRON- content 
the sorry chronicle be less than five thousand word in length 
in give so much time to -PRON- therefore the castaway be continually reread part of the manuscript 
each have -PRON- favorite passage and whipple curious to know just what appeal most to vandeever and simmon take up the little book as each lay -PRON- down 
in case -PRON- clew be various leave bent at the corner and in simmon a pencil checking of sundry paragraph 
-PRON- develop that the cowboy interest be hold by ingenious method of extravagance 
-PRON- would charter a sumptuous private train for instance and take a large party of friend to some prize fight in the middle west or -PRON- would buy a private yacht spend a riotous month in the west indie and then sell the yacht for less than half what -PRON- have pay for -PRON- 
-PRON- would give dinner to boon companion at which diamond and platinum stick pin be pass around as favor 
once in florida -PRON- have rent an entire hotel for a week live in -PRON- in lonely grandeur with every employee at -PRON- beck and nod 
an extravagant eccentricity be never to wear the same suit of clothe twice but give away each suit when -PRON- be take off 
simmon mark passage consist largely of philosophical deduction false friend be one who share -PRON- bounty batten on -PRON- favor and then fail to recognize -PRON- when -PRON- money be go 
-PRON- be a deceiver and a thief 
and this crook be the physical manifestation of a crooked soul warp by greed and a hunger for easy money 
well that a man should have a millstone hung about -PRON- neck and be fling into the sea than to profit in such a way 
and again not money but the love of money be the root of all evil 
because of this -PRON- betray a trust and land in jail or -PRON- commit murder and hang 
one who love money for -PRON- be capable of any atrocity 
whipple on -PRON- own part be entrance with the whole tragic story but -PRON- pet paragraph be some of platitude such as waste not want not and be careful with what -PRON- earn and doubly careful with what be give -PRON- and stand on -PRON- own foot -PRON- behold to no man for so much as a nickel and spend wisely but save with even more wisdom for a tightwad be anathema and a wastrel be a lost soul and lastly this priceless ruby in the casket of diamond be not lure by relative or friend or stranger into way of wasteful extravagance for an act repeat become habit and habit become second nature and second nature become character and character make -PRON- what -PRON- be for well or for bad 
all this to some mind would have be a mere collection of rubbish 
-PRON- be quite possible to understand why the last writing of johnson blue may appeal to whipple and why a cowboy eager to master all the fine art of get rid of money may be interested in -PRON- but that percival simmon should ponder such passage as -PRON- have mark be an incomprehensible mystery 
johnson blue with just money enough leave to get -PRON- to some corner of the country have come to prescott 
like timon of athen -PRON- yearn for some desert place where -PRON- could forget the ingratitude of those whom -PRON- have believe to be friend and kill all thought of the girl ethel who have marry a well man 
so -PRON- buy a burro a grub stake several hundred foot of rope a homing pigeon in a wicker cage and set out for the heart of the hill 
-PRON- idea be to immure -PRON- on an island in the air a supposedly unscalable mesa call encan tada that have come to be a legend in the southwest 
-PRON- purpose be to get away by -PRON- burn all -PRON- bridge and even cast off the rope by which -PRON- have hope to gain the mesas top 
then if -PRON- tire of -PRON- hermitlike existence -PRON- would send word back to prescott by mean of the carrier pigeon and some one would come and effect -PRON- rescue 
-PRON- be a wild fancy 
-PRON- fail to find mesa encantada but -PRON- do happen upon a pocket in the ground as difficult of access as any island in the air 
with -PRON- rope -PRON- manage to get into -PRON- but the rope loosen and come down on -PRON- before -PRON- have lower the remainder of -PRON- supply into the canon 
week later -PRON- half starve burro wander into wickenburg this however be long after the carrier pigeon have make -PRON- home port with a damage message that tell of plight but fail to define -PRON- exact whereabouts 
so from last writing and information give by vandeever whipple piece the story together 
somehow the thrill of -PRON- grow on -PRON- as the day pass 
-PRON- seem to grow on the cowboy and the aviator as well 
knotty problem offer -PRON- to the castaway 
be -PRON- destine to reach the end of -PRON- provision and come to a wretched end there in lose creek canon as blue have do 
who have build and furnish that cabin on the flat with supply for three 
on the answer to this second question hang -PRON- hope of deliverance 
a week pass however without bring the owner of the cabin 
vandeever for once in -PRON- life at least have something more than -PRON- stetson on -PRON- mind 
by glory -PRON- complain lose a hull week here in this hole in the hill waitin for some one to come get to stop coolin -PRON- heel and try to find a way out 
grub be go fast and i move -PRON- meander around and try to find -PRON- rope of maybe -PRON- havenot rot clean to piece and -PRON- can use -PRON- in gettin clear o this blame pocket 
so -PRON- go hunt for the rope 
but -PRON- have vanish completely 
when absolutely certain that -PRON- be not to be find further attempt be make to climb the wall by mean of the hanging vine 
the vine be fragile and after vandeever have take a bad tumble the maneuver be give up as hopeless 
simmon raid the wreck of the ace high and remove and splice to34 gether a number of guy wire 
the result cable prove too stiff and unwieldy and nothing could be do with -PRON- 
in desperation another forlorn search for the rope be begin 
-PRON- be while this be go on that simmon creep along at the edge of the flat under a festoon of trail vine find a small wicker cage with -PRON- door unlatche 
this recall blue to the mind of the castaway 
here undoubtedly be the very cage in which -PRON- have keep -PRON- carrier pigeon 
vandeever fire with a sudden thought drop to -PRON- knee and continue investigation at that part of the foot of the cliff 
-PRON- creep through the vine be lose to sight for five minute and at last emerge into view with a white face and wild eye touch -PRON- -PRON- gasp draw -PRON- sleeve across -PRON- wet forehead and -PRON- -PRON- rattle 
oh -PRON- glory 
what rattle demand whipple 
bone in there blue what s leave o -PRON- 
never have such a start in -PRON- hull life layin under a bit of an overhang and -PRON- grin up at -PRON- all white and and well -PRON- finish jest have to have air 
blue be j a pile o bone in a khaki suit 
say muttered vandeever -PRON- give -PRON- a start sure answer whipple but -PRON- have get a duty to do charley a great little book -PRON- write and the least -PRON- can do be to bury these bone away in the pleasant part of the flat 
look -PRON- fountain pen 
i want -PRON- for -PRON- own this and the eighteen cent 
-PRON- can take the watch and knife and simmon can have the fob and the elktooth charm 
who get the book draw cut for that 
get simmon now get to do the good -PRON- can charley 
the three man get to work and in a short time all that remain of johnson blue have be decently inter to the good of -PRON- ability

evidently these man have find foothold on a shelf conceal by the hanging vine 
at the distance from which -PRON- be view by whipple and -PRON- companion the form be indistinct although -PRON- could clearly be see that there be three of -PRON-

by jupiter look at that 
something be toss out through the gap in the vine 
-PRON- twist writhe unfold and drop down ward resolve -PRON- into a long rope ladder 
as soon as -PRON- be in place the three man descend from the shelf one by one and land on the flat 
by that time the whole canon be plunge in gloom although the eastern rim rock still glimmer under the sun ray 
wait till -PRON- get to the cabin whipple suggest and then well walk in on -PRON- light up and well be able to give each other a good siz ing give -PRON- a big surprise chuckle vandeever if i know anything about -PRON-

and how do -PRON- happen to know about this canon and get here and be wait for -PRON- with these lamb of the golden fleece 
-PRON- seem to have play -PRON- card pretty well but be hang if i can understand -PRON- 
whipple be amazed 
the last speaker be monte a trimlooke blackleg in fancy mountaineer clothe 
the two with -PRON- be -PRON- roughneck pal peco pete geohegan and silver sam hornaday 
all in all -PRON- be about as hard an outfit as ever drift through the arizona hill 
each of the three be well armed and at the moment have a vicious sixgun on display 
what weird turn of fate have bring these man into that lonely canon 
whipple wish then that -PRON- have be even more cautious 
bind for los angele on a quest for spendthrift pleasure neither -PRON- nor -PRON- companion have carry anything in the way of firearm and -PRON- partner be hold all the trump that hand 
the surprise be mutual but every advantage lie with the newcomer a fine lot of coyote ainot -PRON- now 
vandeever remark with fine sarcasm 
-PRON- plan to trim -PRON- there in the back room at but i gallop off with every sou -PRON- three have in -PRON- clothe matchin -PRON- run o luck aginst every nickelplated holdout in -PRON- tinhorn crowd 
then -PRON- scheme to get -PRON- all back by one way or another and miss the bet 
oh -PRON- be a fine outfit of sobber 
monte smile in the oily way characteristic of -PRON- not miss any bet here in lose creek canon concho -PRON- purr 
why didnot -PRON- come down at saddleback flat accord to agreement simmon -PRON- demand whirl on the aviator 
-PRON- get wise to -PRON- here simmon nod toward whipple and vandeever and -PRON- wasnot safe 
then the engine of the old boat go back on -PRON- and -PRON- just happen to land in this canon glad -PRON- get here threecard the good piece of luck that ever come -PRON- way 
whipple and -PRON- pard would have kill -PRON- i guess if i hadnot have help 
cold rage rise in heart -PRON- sorry now -PRON- ask that -PRON- didnot let -PRON- beat -PRON- up 
sim have be playin off on -PRON- 
whipple be nonplus 
at the grave of johnson blue such a short time before -PRON- have feel that simmon confession and regret be sincere but now -PRON- have execute a direct aboutface and be one of crowd 
-PRON- make this certain by step to the other side of the cabin and join the rank of the gambler 
how much have -PRON- get with -PRON- simmon query thousand in cash be the prompt reply 
good i didnot know but -PRON- may have hide -PRON- away somewhere 
put -PRON- on the table whipple every last stiver of -PRON- -PRON- never roar vandeever show -PRON- -PRON- tooth 
if -PRON- get that dinero make -PRON- fight for -PRON- 
-PRON- pick up a chair and back into a corner 
concho remark calmly when -PRON- and -PRON- outfit drop into this canon -PRON- come within one of put a crimp into the smooth paign i ever plan 
-PRON- find a neat little cabin here well stock with supply 
-PRON- and -PRON- friend jump right in and take possession of -PRON- not find any fault with that but i want to assure -PRON- that while be here -PRON- and whipple be go to stay here 
i expect to make this place -PRON- headquarters for the next six month 
show fight concho and well drop -PRON- in -PRON- track 
put down that chair be foolish charley say whipple all the odd be against -PRON- 
this easy yielding wasnot at all like whipple as vandeever know -PRON- so the latter reason that -PRON- friend have something at the back of -PRON- head in the way of a ruse 
strategy that be what -PRON- must be 
build -PRON- hope on that vandeever lower the chair sit clown in -PRON- gloomily and watch while whipple put all of uncle money on the table the part of wisdom whipple observe monte with unctuous approval 
-PRON- may also sit down for the moment 
peco -PRON- go on -PRON- go back to the shelf and pull up the ladder have an uncomfortable night up there but -PRON- have get to make sure that whipple and concho donot clear out and tip off this new roost of -PRON- to the sheriff 
-PRON- canot let that happen -PRON- understand until be through with the canon 
silver will relieve -PRON- in the morning and tomorrow night simmon or i will pull up the ladder and sleep on the shelf forget peco finish that there s a bundle of money in this for all hand 
the mention of money stifle the grumbling of pecos 
-PRON- put away -PRON- gun pull up -PRON- belt and leave the cabin 
monte approach the table and coolly appropriate the crisp bank note that lay there 
this should mean little to -PRON- whipple say -PRON- easily get rid of -PRON- quickly and with a few thrill that ought to interest old plunk 
sorry to dispossess -PRON- but -PRON- have get to have the cabin 
-PRON- and concho can bunk down on the flat see that -PRON- donot starve at least while be here in the canon with -PRON- 
when -PRON- leave for good well that will be another matter 
get a mine here inquire vandeever 
hornaday laugh hoarsely 
well -PRON- may call -PRON- that return with a twisted smile 
peco must be on the shelf by now -PRON- add so -PRON- two can clear out try any foolishness either of -PRON- 
-PRON- voice sharpen as -PRON- launch the warning play for a big stake and wonot stand for any nonsense on -PRON- part 
good night send -PRON- something to eat in the morning 
whipple and vandeever walk out of the cabin follow by the jeer of silver sam hornaday and percival simmon 
as -PRON- move away across the flat leaving behind -PRON- the cabin and -PRON- comfort the cowboy complain bitterly about the aviator 
-PRON- ort to be kill have even up -PRON- score jyith -PRON- if -PRON- would only have let -PRON- alone a while back 
now see how -PRON- have turn on -PRON- 
johnson book never get to -PRON- the same as -PRON- do to -PRON- and -PRON- 
whipple draw closer to -PRON- irate friend 
charley -PRON- whisper believe simmon be still on -PRON- side and that -PRON- s pretend to stand in with in order to be of help to -PRON- 
never in this world declare vandeever emphatically 
be that the reason -PRON- as so pesky meek in shellin out -PRON- thousanddollar bill 
if a thought -PRON- be bankin on that 
a fought till i drop 
simmon be a twofaced measly coyote all off with that noble idee o -PRON- to give back the dinero to -PRON- uncle 
but that ainot worryin -PRON- so much as gettin clear o this tough outfit and takin a slant for phoenix get back the money before -PRON- leave the canon assert whipple 
how 
whipple do not know how but -PRON- believe there would be opportunity and -PRON- would be able to manage -PRON- 
-PRON- lead the way through the gloom to the overhang where johnson blue have pitch -PRON- dismal camp 
aimin to sleep in there demand vandeever 
why not 
-PRON- get pretty cold at night and -PRON- must have some kind of shelter 
what be good enough for blue ought to be good enough for -PRON- 
whipple go down on all four and crawl through the swinging vine 
the cowboy follow -PRON- finally but not without many protest 
pll bet the place be hante -PRON- mutter 
well -PRON- couldnot be haunt by a kindly spirit than greatly oblige to johnson blue charley 
-PRON- have show -PRON- how to look wisely at some of the problem of life 
huh grunted vandeever -PRON- be only a spender that get cold foot when -PRON- money be go 
mebby -PRON- will sleep but be hang if i think go to 
night pard 
a a rock be all that whipple and vandeever have to sleep on there under the overhang 
but -PRON- be man of hard fiber and use to the hardship of the hill 
the chastened spirit of johnson blue seem to fill the place 
to whipple this unseen presence be as a benediction nor be -PRON- as disturb to vandeever as -PRON- have fancy -PRON- may be for when morning come -PRON- be sleep so soundly that -PRON- friend have to shake -PRON- into wakefulness 
see anything last night inquire the cowboy as -PRON- sit up and rub -PRON- eye 
not a thing 
same here 
glory 
i never reckon sleep like that crawl out o this hole in the wall and find the sun 
a morning in southern arizona be one of the most cheer wonder of the country 
the mount sun have a glory all -PRON- own and the air have a tonic warrant to put to flight all the blue devil that lurk in a human heart 
vandeever be in a more hopeful mood than on the precede evening 
if -PRON- could get hold of a couple o -PRON- sixgun -PRON- remark while -PRON- and whipple be dip -PRON- head in the creek -PRON- neednot ask no odd of anybody whipple shake the water out of -PRON- hair and dry -PRON- face on -PRON- handkerchief play a wait game charley -PRON- say and see what turn up busy get breakfast over there at the cabin -PRON- add -PRON- speculative gaze on the smoke that be rise from the chimney could mow away a man size share o grub if i have the chance 
seem like may invite -PRON- in for the morning snack 
-PRON- wonot do that -PRON- s plan to keep -PRON- at a distance from the money and the gun and will send breakfast out to -PRON- 
there come sam hornaday now whipple add 
and -PRON- ainot totin any chow grumble vandeever disappointedly 
hornaday however be not come in the direction of the two at the foot of the vineclad cliff 
-PRON- look in -PRON- direction grin unpleasantly and keep on toward the eastern wall 
there -PRON- halt and yell for pecos 
the latter look out from the opening among the vine answer the hail and then throw down the rope ladder 
-PRON- could capture the ladder from -PRON- two if -PRON- have any kind o luck vandeever suggest 
whipple shake -PRON- head 
while peco be descend the ladder hornaday stand at the foot of -PRON- on guard with a gun in each hand have a dream charley say whipple would be glad to have -PRON- try something like that 
after the dust settle there would be one amalgamator and one cowpunch to keep johnson blue company on this flat 
and what good would the ladder be to -PRON- if -PRON- have to use -PRON- and leave the money behind get to have action vandeever fret 
walkin lame and jumpin through the hoop at order be a heap more than i can stand 
take -PRON- easy there will be plenty of action when the right time cony 
peco step from the rope ladder to the ground do a brief round of sentry go while hornaday climb to the shelf and hoist the trail rope then peco make -PRON- way to the cabin 
everything so far as cleverness could devise -PRON- have be make secure 
presently simmon appear at the cabin door carry a basket 
-PRON- strike out briskly across the flat moving in the direction of whipple and vandeever 
the latter breathing hard jump to -PRON- foot 
whipple catch -PRON- and pull -PRON- back 
hang on to -PRON- charley -PRON- admonish 
-PRON- donot want to spoil -PRON- breakfast do -PRON- canot begin to tell -PRON- how the sight o that traitor grind -PRON- muttered vandeever see that -PRON- get -PRON- if -PRON- the last thing i ever do 
simmon halt a few foot away and set down the basket warily eye the cowboy as -PRON- do so 
charley be get -PRON- wrong -PRON- say pitch -PRON- voice low with -PRON- two but i can be of more help by pretend to stand in with straight 
kick up some kind of a row so i can have an excuse to stand here and talk for a minute be watch from the cabin and hornaday from the shelf 
at the first suspicion that not really throw in with -PRON- be as helpless as -PRON- two be maybe bad off 
whipple jump to -PRON- foot and advance a step bad than a sidewinder to turn -PRON- down like this -PRON- shout apparently in great anger 
all i want be a club roar vandeever 
simmon jerk a revolver from -PRON- pocket seemingly -PRON- be hold the two wrathful man at bay 
what -PRON- say still in an undertone be this hornaday and geohegan rob the bank at eudora and -PRON- be hide out here with sixty thousand dollar in cash and liberty bond 
-PRON- have fix up this canon for a hangout and have some more robbery -PRON- be aim to pull off 
when -PRON- find -PRON- here -PRON- sort of spill the bean 
go easy -PRON- two 
and be watchful 
bullet be apt to come -PRON- way at any time not do yet 
do something make -PRON- look as though there be bad blood between -PRON- and -PRON- be try to get -PRON- 
i be tell to shoot at the first sign of trouble 
vandeever start to make a rush 
crack go simmon revolver 
the bullet fly wide but vandeever clutch at -PRON- left arm and reel back to be on the shelf tonight guard the ladder simmon go on speak hurriedly -PRON- chance to do something come down around midnight and well see what -PRON- can do at the cabin 
-PRON- will be desperate though make up -PRON- mind to that 
simmon whirl on -PRON- heel and start back across the flat turning again and again to flourish the revolver and shout wild threat reckon that play look like the real thing say vandeever and sure surprised at that sim 
at that mebby -PRON- s only stringin -PRON- along 
give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt charley urge whipple prove to -PRON- satisfaction whether or not -PRON- can rely on -PRON- tonight 
-PRON- donot seem right sensible that would send -PRON- here with that grub unless there be some kind of a hen on muse the cowboy darkly 
-PRON- be roll up -PRON- sleeve and bind a handkerchief about -PRON- arm a red silk handkerchief with which -PRON- have supply -PRON- in phoenix 
have pretend to be wound -PRON- be important to keep the deception alive 
while eat breakfast -PRON- do not use -PRON- left hand but keep -PRON- tuck away between the button of -PRON- coat 
the meal be a generous one consisting of coffee cracker bacon and fry potato 
as the two friend eat -PRON- consider this new turn of event 
monte widely know as a crooked gambler have blossom into an robber and holdup man 
a safe retreat from the law be that hidden and inaccessible canon 
how have find -PRON- be a mystery but have find -PRON- -PRON- be not slow to recognize -PRON- value from a lawless viewpoint 
if press by officer of the law -PRON- could come down -PRON- rope ladder and if the canon be find -PRON- could pull down the ladder as a last resort 
from that spot -PRON- and -PRON- confederate could make -PRON- raid and then return to a rendezvous that be almost proof against discovery 
naturally find whipple and -PRON- companion in the canon be a disagreeable surprise to the unpleasantness however be temper by the seventyfive thousand dollar which whipple have be force to give up 
for a little while and because of uncle money the gambler may bear with the castaway but in due course as whipple know monte would tire of the trouble whipple and vandeever make -PRON- and would seek to eliminate -PRON- 
before this tragic move be deliberately attempt the amalgamator and the cowboy would have to strike and strike hard with simmon help be the time aver whipple for -PRON- be take grave chance if -PRON- wait longer than that 
have finish -PRON- breakfast -PRON- light a pipe and arise to -PRON- foot go over to the bend and see if the wreck of the ace high have anything to offer -PRON- in the way of a makeshift weapon 
if -PRON- come to close quarter with the gang tonight charley -PRON- ought to have something besides -PRON- fist to fight with 
good idee assented vandeever 
as -PRON- start north along the creek suddenly appear from the cabin 
-PRON- carry a rifle 
where have -PRON- start for -PRON- shout 
j takin a little amble to stretch -PRON- leg vandeever answer with a scowl 
well amble around the flat but keep clear of the cabin 
try to leave the flat concho and well open up on -PRON- 
that go as -PRON- lay 
vandeever hesitate clench -PRON- fist and grind -PRON- tooth 
fust time on record i ever take order from a tinhorn -PRON- growl 
but i reckon there ainot anything else to be do 
-PRON- turn and begin follow whipple back toward the vineclad cliff 
and here something else yell 
-PRON- two have get to cut out the rough stuff when i send some one over with -PRON- meal 
simmon ought to have lay -PRON- out concho 
just for what -PRON- do this morning -PRON- man will get no dinner 
if -PRON- prove to be peaceable and obey order about stay on the flat take some supper over to -PRON- -PRON- 
vandeever be furious but -PRON- have sense enough to smother -PRON- feeling 
most certainly -PRON- and whipple be under the thumb of this smooth tricky card sharp and hard though -PRON- be the situation would have to be bear for the present 
the morning pass with another reading of johnson book and the discussion to which the various philosophical gem give rise 
in view of the melancholy circumstance that prevail in the canon the last word of the wastrel castaway be more impressive than ever 
noon pass and be as good as -PRON- word about withhold dinner 
at one oclock peco relieve silver as guardian of the ladder and both ruffian in go and come jeer the two hungry man as -PRON- pass -PRON- 
this be fierce tell a man grunt vandeever 
hit -PRON- anywhere but where i live i can stand anything but that 
-PRON- ought to be able to miss a meal with good grace charley say whipple 
think what blue have to put up with 
oh stand -PRON- return the cowboy hastily but like to eat a hundred dollar wuth o ham and egg in front of and -PRON- famishin and lace to a post with a reata 
the afternoon drag horribly and hornaday and simmon play card in the shade of the cabin gun close at hand 
-PRON- be careful to take up a position from which -PRON- could watch whipple and deever every minute 
as the sun drop low over the rim of the canon the card playing cease and hornaday and simmon go into the house to get supper 
when be call by hornaday to come in an eat -PRON- stand up and look in the direction of the amalgamator and the cowboy change -PRON- mind conho -PRON- call 
-PRON- and -PRON- pard stand -PRON- so well without dinner that go to hold back ypur supper 
vandeever give an ugly laugh as vanish inside the cabin 
even a smooth tinhorn like -PRON- can play the fool now and then -PRON- remark to -PRON- friend 
the bad fighter i ever see be a guy just hungry enough to be mad and not starve sufficient to be any way weak 
because of losin -PRON- two meal walk in on the hull gang this minute alone and with -PRON- bare hand go to be some fight when -PRON- pull -PRON- off have play well a very difficult role 
-PRON- be no easy maneuver to deceive monte and yet this be precisely what simmon have do 
the gambler be convince that the aviator be faithful to -PRON- and -PRON- lawless plotting and believe fully that no love be lose between the aviator and whipple and vandeever 
so simmon be trust with the work of guard the rope ladder 
-PRON- relieve peco and go on duty while the sun be still flash brightly on the vineclad wall but -PRON- have not be fifteen minute on the shelf before and hornaday run swiftly across the flat and take up -PRON- position at the foot of the cliff 
hey simmon shout what be -PRON- do with two extra sixgun get a brace of revolver more than -PRON- need or be entitle to 
drop -PRON- into the blanket 
as -PRON- finish speak -PRON- and hornaday stretch a blanket between -PRON- and wait for the weapon to be throw into -PRON- 
but -PRON- wait in vain 
whipple and vandeever guess what have happen 
in -PRON- zeal to help -PRON- simmon have appropriate the extra revolver and take -PRON- with -PRON- when -PRON- climb to the shelf 
-PRON- be not minded to give -PRON- up and so yield an advantage gain by -PRON- cleverness 
besides faith in -PRON- be shake and temporize with a man like this gambler when -PRON- be in such a state of mind would have be suicidal 
simmon keep well back on the shelf and hang on to the gun 
hornaday lose patience and swear heartily have well command of -PRON- 
put over the ladder percy and come down request the gambler -PRON- tone and manner not at all suggestive of the emotion that fill -PRON- 
simmon however be too know to let down the ladder and descend and place -PRON- at the mercy of threecard monte 
come down the gambler order at last drop -PRON- mask of friendliness and proceed to threat give -PRON- two minute and if -PRON- be not down by that time silver and i will riddle the face of the cliff with bullet 
no word or sign come from simmon then promptly when the two minute be up a merry fusillade stir wild echo in the canon 
peco a cup of coffee in one hand and a sourdough biscuit in the other come to a corner of the cabin to watch the excitement 
whipple be not slow to see that a situation have develop which if quickly and properly use would be highly advantageous to -PRON- and vandeever 
charley -PRON- whisper while and hornaday be busy with simmon and while geohegan be give all -PRON- attention to that side of the canon no one seem to take any interest in -PRON- and -PRON- 
come on detour to the west and reach the cabin door while geohegan be face the other way 
that scheme be a lulu mutter the cowboy with enthusiasm 
a quick run to the left bring the two around the western side of the cabin 
whipple be almost at the open door when peco awake to what be go on behind -PRON- 
the coffee cup go one way and what be leave of the biscuit go another 
no yu donot -PRON- roar dash for the open door and juggle with a revolver as -PRON- come on 
back up or drop yu where yu stand whipple shift -PRON- line of advance and instead of enter the cabin -PRON- plunge straight at pecos 
the latter halted plant -PRON- firmly and lift the revolver 
whipple be desperate and geohegan equally determine 
a distant report shatter the still air break a lull in the target practice of and hornaday 
geohegan give vent to a hoarse yell of pain and the revolver fall from -PRON- fist 
score one for sim shout vandeever jubilantly 
that be as neat a bit of drop firin as i ever see 
simmon have come into action and at the very instant -PRON- service could best serve -PRON- friend 
whipple reach side at a jump and in a flash have gather up the fall weapon 
into the cabin with -PRON- -PRON- order prod peco with the muzzle of the gun 
monte yelled peco as -PRON- grip -PRON- injure right arm with -PRON- left hand sam trouble at the ca whipple give peco a push that send -PRON- through the open door headlong get -PRON- cry vandeever from inside the cabin 
get in here quick once the door be closed -PRON- can hold this shack aginst all comer 
that move however effective though -PRON- may be be not for whipple and hornaday have lose all interest in simmon for the moment and be race back toward the cabin 
a revolver crack and a bullet buzz angrily past cheek 
-PRON- find -PRON- look into the gambler cool murderous eye tell -PRON- what to expect if -PRON- cut any caper snap and now here where -PRON- get your 
-PRON- first shot have miss because -PRON- be in too much of a hurry 
now -PRON- be more deliberate and laugh jeeringly when whipple flex -PRON- finger bring down the hammer of gun on an empty shell no doubt feel that -PRON- could afford to take -PRON- time and make sure 
whipple be near the great divide at that moment than uncle wes have ever be in -PRON- life

with a useless gun and no cartridge at hand with which to replenish the cylinder whipple be at an impasse 
hornaday watch weaseleye be wait for -PRON- to show enough of -PRON- to make a target worth while 
this blockade be lift by simmon as unexpectedly as vandeever have crash through the window and fere with watch from the shelf in the gathering half gloom the aviator have realize how badly -PRON- be need by -PRON- friend so -PRON- have lower the ladder cross the flat and come up noiselessly on side of the woodpile 
the first whipple know of this be by a startled yell from hornaday

from that point on the struggle be as brief as -PRON- be decisive 
when hornaday at the revolver point be march into the cabin be discover flat on -PRON- back on the floor two knee on -PRON- chest one hand compress -PRON- throat and the other hand grip revolver threaten and hold geohegan at bay

funny how a batch of writin like get under a feller hide ainot -PRON- 
whipple vandeever and simmon pass -PRON- last night in the canon cabin 
while two of -PRON- sleep one be always on guard 
the prisoner be resourceful and desperate man and no chance be to be take with -PRON- 
next morning there be an early breakfast and the three friend make -PRON- preparation for leave the cabin and get out of the hill 
three canteen be fill with cool clear water from the creek and three pack of supply be make ready 
three revolver belong to and -PRON- partner be appropriate and -PRON- cylinder replenish with fresh ammunition 
whipple have try hard to learn something about the situation of the canon the route to be follow in get back to phoenix and the method by which and those with -PRON- have reach that part of the rough country 
the gambler have nothing to tell -PRON- and neither have hornaday nor geohegan never make -PRON- on foot have say -PRON- grub and water will be go before -PRON- be halfway out 
a stray prospector may find -PRON- bone some time in the future but even that be a bet 
then return whipple coolly -PRON- will be as hard on -PRON- as -PRON- be on -PRON- for when -PRON- leave here well haul up the rope ladder 
if -PRON- get out well send a sheriff and posse back after -PRON- better isnot -PRON- than starve to death in this canon 
a gloomy expression cross the face of hornaday and geohegan but the gambler seem utterly unmoved 
not accord to -PRON- way of thinking say all the firearm in the cabin be carry away by whipple and -PRON- friend 
geohegan be leave with -PRON- hand free and -PRON- would be only a short time before -PRON- release and hornaday of -PRON- bond 
carry off the gun be to prevent further trouble while the homewardbound party climb to the rim rock and set out on the eastern trail 
whipple who be the last man to reach the shelf find -PRON- on a broad smooth ledge which have a downward pitch to the place where -PRON- join the cliff 
simmon explain how easy -PRON- have be to keep clear of bullet launch from the flat merely by hug the rear wall 
and there s the way up -PRON- finish indicate the lip of a fissure that angle steeply toward the top of the wall back of the swinging vine have a mind to explore that only didnot give -PRON- time 
the rope ladder be draw up and pile on the shelf and all the extra firearm be lay beside -PRON- then whipple lead the climb for the top be begin 
steady nerve be demand for this and the amalgamator be glad that the festoon vine hide from -PRON- eye the dizzy depth of the canon 
in due course -PRON- come out on the crest of the bank and pause to let -PRON- gaze rove over the flat 
all the prisoner be free of -PRON- rope and stand in a forlorn group by the cabin -PRON- face no more than white patch against the greenery below 
hornaday and geohegan shake -PRON- fist coolly light a cigarette gaze move toward the left where a sandy mound lift -PRON- among the tree 
all that be mortal of johnson blue be there a misguided man who find wisdom in the spot where death overtake -PRON-

-PRON- turn to look eastward 
-PRON- be a discouraging vista for all that could be see in that direction be peak after peak 
whipple descend an easy slope on -PRON- way to a seam that open between two of the hill 
-PRON- stop suddenly -PRON- eye on the sand in front of -PRON- 
one secret be out anyway -PRON- exclaim get here in an automobile where the machine stop to let -PRON- and -PRON- two partner off and there s where -PRON- turn to take the back track 
a note of cheer creep into -PRON- voice 
if an automobile could get here -PRON- go on donot see how be go to run into any very hard traveling 
all -PRON- have get to do be to follow the track 
the track be easily trace and lead into the seam wound tortuously about the basis of the hill and then climb a ridge and descend into a wide shallow valley 
the sun be mount toward the zenith a brazen fiery shield whose ray grow hotter as the day wear on 
heat wave rise from the baked earth quiver in the furnacelike air 
clump of cholla cactus and greasewood dance grotesquely when view through the waver transparent veil 
simmon be first to give out 
-PRON- stagger to -PRON- knee with a groan no good at this kind of travel -PRON- complain 
this pack on -PRON- shoulder weigh a ton 
for the dozenth time -PRON- uncap -PRON- canteen and put -PRON- to -PRON- lip 
vandeever snatch -PRON- away from -PRON- waterlogge sim say the cowboy 
-PRON- get to be careful o the stuff in the canteen 
and anyways -PRON- could drink like a fish and -PRON- wouldnot help none 
get up and try agin help -PRON- 
with vandeever on one side and whipple on the other lend -PRON- -PRON- support the aviator reel on 
over -PRON- head the amalgamator and the cowboy exchange significant glance 
simmon be not toughen to the desert as -PRON- be and -PRON- realize that -PRON- be go to be a tremendous handicap 
but -PRON- have play a man part in the canon face set hard and lip tighten 
what one think be at that moment in the mind of the other -PRON- would all win clear of those scorch waterless hill or -PRON- would all stay in -PRON- to the end of time 
when simmon foot refuse to move another step whipple find a great bare pinnacle of rock and in -PRON- shadow all three sit down for a rest 
-PRON- eat some of -PRON- food wash -PRON- down with a few sip from the canteen 
when the time come for -PRON- to start on again whipple and vandeever scan the sky with ominous eye and decide to remain where -PRON- be 
the hilltop to the north be blur with a haze of ghastly yellow 
the haze thicken into an opaque curtain and draw onward with a rush 
a puff of wind blister hot stir the sand of the valley until the ground seem to be smoke an elegant row of stump growl vandeever a thing like this couldnot happen only right now could -PRON- the matter query simmon 
sand storm answer whipple briefly 
hug the lee of that rock simmon and pull off -PRON- coat and have -PRON- ready to put over -PRON- head 
-PRON- all knelt and push close to the rock pinnacle 
the fly sand whisper against -PRON- worn side then as the wind increase in fury gusty blast eddy around the huge bowlder and drive the sand stingingly against -PRON- face 
the yellow fog be all around -PRON- and the smother heat make breathe almost impossible 
with head muffle in -PRON- coat -PRON- gasp and choke and almost stifle 
the physical torment bring by the storm give the impression that -PRON- be hour in pass but -PRON- duration could have be measure in minute 
after reach -PRON- height -PRON- breathe -PRON- out leave three mound of sand from which the traveler extricate -PRON- 
that be short than usual remark vandeever shake the sand out of -PRON- sleeve and wipe -PRON- from -PRON- grimy face 
the bad thing -PRON- do to -PRON- be to blot out the track of that automobile say whipple now -PRON- have get to head east and go -PRON- blind 
when -PRON- pack be disinter -PRON- be discover that simmon canteen be miss 
-PRON- could remember nothing about -PRON- 
all three spend an hour kick around in the loose sand and be compel at last to give up the search 
lose the canteen be a calamity but nothing be say by whipple or vandeever to make simmon feel bad about -PRON- carelessness than -PRON- do 
-PRON- struggle on down that interminable valley -PRON- only blessing the lessen heat of the sun as -PRON- drop toward -PRON- setting 
another halt be make at sundown 
the aviator by that time be in a sorry state 
-PRON- eye be puff -PRON- tongue and lip be swollen and the last particle of energy have be sap from -PRON- body 
but there be a grow coolness in the air that be most refreshing and simmon slump to the ground close -PRON- eye and sleep 
whipple arouse -PRON- after a while and give -PRON- -PRON- ration from the pack 
-PRON- eat gulp down the little water -PRON- be allow to have then go to sleep again 
an hour later -PRON- two companion get -PRON- to -PRON- foot once more and -PRON- continue -PRON- weary plodding onward under the brilliant arizona night sky 
whipple con -PRON- course by the star and press the pace 
there be now a very decided chill in the air which would have be most uncomfortable have the three traveler not be constantly move 
simmon bear up better than -PRON- have do during the day but -PRON- strength be flag even while whipple and vandeever be go at -PRON- good no good at this -PRON- pant -PRON- fellow go on and leave -PRON- here 
when -PRON- get out send somebody back to pick -PRON- up 
not on -PRON- tintype sim return the cowboy with emphasis 
-PRON- all go or -PRON- all stay and that s flat 
buck up 
-PRON- can make five mile at night a heap easy than -PRON- can do one by day 
here well help -PRON- 
whipple and vandeever take turn carry simmon pack and help to support -PRON- 
-PRON- manage to keep -PRON- on -PRON- foot until after midnight and then find further attempt useless 
drop to the ground on the very spot where simmon give out all of -PRON- sleep dog weary and worn to the point of exhaustion 
-PRON- awake with the blaze sun once more in -PRON- eye and the blister heat grow as the sun mount toward the high heaven 
then begin such a struggle as neither whipple nor vandeever have ever know in all -PRON- arizona year 
simmon grow lightheade and become hard to manage 
-PRON- fight to get hold of the canteen and the few drop of water that remain in -PRON- -PRON- discard -PRON- pack -PRON- sit down obstinately and refuse to move in short -PRON- do everything -PRON- irrational mind suggest to delay the journey 
the amalgamator and the cowboy grapple with -PRON- drag -PRON- carry -PRON- -PRON- one consume desire to get onward at any cost 
simmon begin to see vision of flow water and green tree 
-PRON- babble about -PRON- and try to crawl to the shelter of the grove and reach the stream 
vandeever sprawl in the hot sand give vent to a croak laugh 
-PRON- reach out gropingly with -PRON- hand -PRON- canteen -PRON- ask faintly 
right in front of -PRON- there exclaim the startled whipple -PRON- see -PRON- charley 
see nothing be sun blind for an hour

sure say whipple and toss the canteen away 
once more vandeever laugh -PRON- the gay spender for -PRON- -PRON- croak hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollar in -PRON- jean and -PRON- couldnot buy a glass o water with -PRON-

well that s about like -PRON- be all i can say there be no answer 
with an effort vandeever get to -PRON- knee and crawl over the hot sand grope with -PRON- hand 
-PRON- find what -PRON- be hunt for at last a still form crumple and motionless 
-PRON- feel the face and with -PRON- hand -PRON- pat one of the shoulder 
good pard a man ever have -PRON- mutter 
if here where -PRON- take the long trail i couldnot ask for no well company ride back to consciousness on a sea of troubled dream and a voice which have an oddly familiar sound cause -PRON- to sit up quickly and take notice 
-PRON- be night one of those splendid night for which the desert country be note 
the star be so big and bright that -PRON- seem as though one have only to reach out a hand in order to get hold of belt or of the big or little bear 
there be a lush smell of standing water and whipple lower -PRON- eye and see a goodsized water hole surround by a dusky chaparral of mesquite 
how the moonbeam play and dance over that stretch of water in the near distance be a glow camp fire 
a very tall man in sharp silhouette be jerk a bag from the tooth of a scrawny cropeare burro 
toss the bag on a heap of camp plunder the man haul the burro away on a picket rope picket -PRON- where -PRON- wonot be so handy to the grub handsome say the boss of the camp and -PRON- and the burro lose -PRON- temporarily in the chaparral shadow wander glance take in -PRON- close vicinity

-PRON- prescription be to stir around and be active what be do ever since -PRON- sail away in a flyin machine and drop plumb off the earth 
pm not feelin more than thirty year old this minute 
this spell of desert ramblin have chirk -PRON- up wonderful 
that lady doc doctor sure know -PRON- business 
for a minute or two whipple be so overwhelmed that -PRON- lose the power of speech 
at last -PRON- find -PRON- tongue 
lady doctor -PRON- echo 
be that doctor mixinger a lady 
in every sense o the word declare uncle wes and -PRON- s a right competent lady if anybody want to ask -PRON-

i have to get back -PRON- money before -PRON- have spend -PRON- all 
believe -PRON- i do stir around i figgere that every day i lose while lookin for -PRON- cost -PRON- more than three thousand dollar 
and i lose a lot of -PRON- mainly because -PRON- and -PRON- party have climb into the sky and nobody have any idee where -PRON- have come down 
the guess be pretty general that -PRON- be all kill by an accident to -PRON- machine and be lyin in the mountain somewhere 
naturally i want to beat the coyote to -PRON- money 
monte have put up a job on -PRON- and -PRON- know about that uncle wes cut in whipple 
so charley vandeever be tellin -PRON- 
well the sheriff and a posse start for saddleback flat uncle wes continue and galusha mingo and katie and -PRON- -PRON- get an automobile and follow -PRON- up but katie murmur whipple 
do -PRON- try to find -PRON- too never see a girl feel so bad over anything as -PRON- do over the way -PRON- disappear 
-PRON- and galusha be still look for -PRON- but -PRON- be stay at jimmie cabin in apache draw and do -PRON- searchin from there 
-PRON- see there be no sign of -PRON- at saddleback flat and no sign of and -PRON- crowd but -PRON- all have a notion -PRON- have be wreck in the mountain so -PRON- begin to hunt each in -PRON- different way 
i borrow jimmie burro handsome and get a grub stake off of jimmie and put off into the hill on -PRON- own 
the sheriff and -PRON- bunch be usin an automobile and galusha and daughter katie be ridin hossback 
day before yesterday i hit some automobile track 
i could tell by the tread of the tire that -PRON- track wasnot make by the sheriff machine so i follere -PRON- straight into the heart of the rough country 
i reckon i be get purty warm just when that blame sand storm hit the hill and wipe out the automobile track 
i make for this water hole as soon as i dig handsome and -PRON- out of the drifted sand and pitch camp here then i stroll up that wide valley and fairly stumble over -PRON- and -PRON- two pard 
-PRON- look for a spell as though -PRON- lay right where the flyin machine have drop -PRON- and that about all that be leave of -PRON- be reemain 
but i be wrong for all three of -PRON- be alive 
two swallow of water make vandeever sit up and talk then i begin to get the hang o thing 
i be playin in great luck and -PRON- and -PRON- friend be do the same 
the suddenness with which -PRON- uncle have step out of the role of a confirm invalid and spread -PRON- over the country in active pursuit of what be leave of -PRON- hundred thousand dollar be a matter of consume wonder to whipple 
now that uncle wes have a long life ahead of -PRON- nothing be more natural than that -PRON- should want -PRON- money back again should say -PRON- be in luck declare whipple 
-PRON- understand get a right to take back what s leave of -PRON- money 
of course why uncle wes i be plan to return -PRON- to -PRON- shy something like twentyfive thousand say the old tightwad 
be -PRON- willin to make -PRON- up to -PRON- a nice kind of an uncle -PRON- old skinflint yelp vandeever 
after tellin to go out and spend the dinero -PRON- be now crawfishin on -PRON- own game 
how can -PRON- give -PRON- back what -PRON- hasnot get an extry twenty thousand in cash in the satchel remark uncle wes and forty thousand in liberty bond 
-PRON- canot have -PRON- uncle say whipple -PRON- belong to the eudora bank loot a reward of five thousand dollar out for capturin the robber return uncle wes cannily and ten per cent of all the loot recover 
that mean eleven thousand cornin to -PRON- 
that would help some 
part of the reward go to charley and simmon whipple tell -PRON- uncle but -PRON- can have -PRON- third of -PRON- 
then there s something else pursued uncle wes 
-PRON- give muggyone mike moloney fifty dollar and the old hassayamper use -PRON- for a grubstake drawin up an agreement with -PRON- signin -PRON- and leavin -PRON- with felix vannell at the fordham 
and be bless if muggyone didnot prance right out into the phoenix mountain and drop onto a true fissure that everybody have walk over for the last fifty year 
the rock go fifty dollar to the ton and already muggyone have be offer a big price for -PRON- find 
muggyone locate that prospect file on -PRON- and have the big offer to buy all in lessn ten day fast work on reecord and the only time in -PRON- hull rovin life that muggyone ever have any luck 
-PRON- hasnot run much in -PRON- line 
-PRON- three go ahead and sleep uncle wes continue go to sit up and keep the fire blazin bright 
the sheriff and -PRON- posse be trailin around in this part of the hill and tryin to signal -PRON- readin a right interestin book -PRON- have in the satchel with all that money the last writing of johnson blue 
go ahead and read -PRON- urge vandeever as -PRON- fall back on the sand and turn over on -PRON- side if -PRON- wasnot such an ironclad old hiderack mebby -PRON- word of would get under -PRON- skin and do some good 
but -PRON- wonot do no harm to give -PRON- a chance anyways be all a part of history now the sudden and meteoric rise of one wesley whipple who ride into phoenix one spring day scattering ballad all along the trail from the threeply mine to town 
-PRON- story as one glean -PRON- from the paper read like a tale from the thousand and one night 
first there be uncle wesley plunkett deceive -PRON- with the help of doc flickinger into believe -PRON- be already climb the foothill of the great divide and be to be over the summit in three month to a day almost to an hour 
then come the queer proceeding whereby uncle wes execute a rightabout from -PRON- miserly habit give -PRON- nephew outright one hundred thousand dollar to spend and enjoy and a few day later in a spirit of rich comedy the record tell of doctor mixinger of prescott proving to the old prospector by stern method that -PRON- heart be all right and that -PRON- still have thirty year to live 
there be chuckle in phoenix over that and more chuckle over the way old plunk go into the hill hunt for -PRON- vanish nephew and what remain of the hundred thousand 
all arizona know in due course how whipple and vandeever and -PRON- hire aviator simmon have be cast away in the mysterious lost creek canon and there have be find by hornaday and geohegan fresh from saddleback flat where -PRON- have miss a gay scheme of plunder only to connect with -PRON- again in pocket among the hill 
how whipple and -PRON- comrade have turn the table on and -PRON- man leave -PRON- in the canon and almost perished on -PRON- way out of the hill be but part of a story tell over and over in store and dwelling among the mine and on the cattle range 
and the kick which fate have put into this particular angle of the affair be wrap up in the fact that -PRON- be the one who have find and rescue -PRON- nephew vandeever and simmon not only get back what remain of -PRON- money but also and this be the big the marvelous thing as -PRON- turn out find the book of johnson blue and develop an absorb interest in the wastrel sound philosophy 
the whole southwest learn how the sheriff and posse in -PRON- flivver catch smoke signal from the camp at the water hole make for -PRON- and learn about the bank looter trap and hold in lose creek canon 
vandeever -PRON- sight restore but with eye protect by smoked glass furnish by uncle wes pilot the law officer along the shallow valley over the ridge through the seam and so to the canon 
there the wily and -PRON- two roughneck confederate be capture with very little trouble and land behind the bar of the building in the courthouse plaza in phoenix 
after the court have deal with -PRON- -PRON- be take to another place of stone wall and bar for an extended stay 
bad news however be current regard mogollon mike moloney and the fiftydollar grubstake furnish by whipple 
originally -PRON- have be bestow as a free gift to an old friend but so white be moloney in -PRON- intention that in secret -PRON- draw up a grubstake agreement and deposit -PRON- with felix vanne in trust for whipple 
the mine be sell ultimately for fifty thousand dollar 
of this amount however whipple receive nothing as moloney lose the entire amount in settle gambling debt which -PRON- incur on the strength of -PRON- find fifty dollar cast as bread upon the water therefore never return to -PRON- and the incident could not be include among the dazzle romance of the mining country 
but as whipple remark -PRON- have expect nothing and therefore could not be disappoint 
the bank reward go share and share alike to whipple vandeever and simmon 
and vandeever and simmon be not forget by whipple for when the latter buy a ranch near prescott charley van have an interest in -PRON- and act as foreman and simmon who start wrong but catch -PRON- up through the writing of the late johnson blue be also give a position

when -PRON- return -PRON- to -PRON- nephew -PRON- be a changed man

uncle wes want to return the seventyfive thousand dollar to whipple declare that -PRON- have give -PRON- in good faith and should not take -PRON- back 
but whipple insist that -PRON- have no right to the money quote blue to support -PRON- argument and refuse flatly to accept -PRON- 
although overrule on this point uncle wes be like the rock of gibraltar in refuse to let -PRON- nephew make up any of the amount -PRON- have spend wasnot to invest any of the hundred thousand uncle wes argue whipple but -PRON- seem that i do that unwittingly

i owe that to a land that can produce a man like johnson blue 
hereafter go to live like a white man

and there s that galusha mingo investment -PRON- boy and then the rest of -PRON- the wedding go to buy a present for that affair that will cost a wad of money -PRON- to be

but well not discuss that 
-PRON- finish -PRON- recital katie listen breathlessly 
all very good approve galusha mingo 
capture the robber and recover the money have cause -PRON- to get ahead in spite of -PRON- 
no doubt -PRON- have wonder about the ten thousand dollar which i pry out of -PRON- 
well tell about that 
katie and i be worried to see -PRON- spend -PRON- money so foolishly so -PRON- lay -PRON- plan to save some of -PRON- for -PRON- 
with the money -PRON- let -PRON- have i buy an option on big brick block 
-PRON- be hard up and eager to sell and -PRON- option call for a bargain and give -PRON- thirty day for a turnover didnot need the thirty day -PRON- continue 
in just a week i dispose of the option for twenty thousand dollar and i be hold the profit for -PRON- 
-PRON- would be a start -PRON- see want -PRON- to know add mingo earnestly that i didnot take that money for -PRON- 
-PRON- be a plot of and -PRON- to help -PRON- and i have to draw on -PRON- psychology and proceed by indirection in order to be of any assistance to -PRON- 
katie have worry about that and the false position in which -PRON- have apparently place -PRON- talk that over say to mingo 
suppose -PRON- take a walk down the draw katie -PRON- ask 
-PRON- take -PRON- walk and by a spring under a cottonwood tree -PRON- sit down and katie begin to speak of mamie and lorena want to tell -PRON- about mamie and lorena katie whipple interrupt 
if -PRON- will remember i meet those two girl at a party at -PRON- house 
-PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- 
whenever i come into town with a little money to spend mamie and lorena be all for help -PRON- get rid of -PRON- while -PRON- be always ask -PRON- to put -PRON- in the bank or pay -PRON- debt 
well -PRON- know debt never bother -PRON- much 
i be always for let the other fellow worry 
too free and easy -PRON- understand but with not a desire to beat anybody out of what be -PRON- just due 
i just couldnot seem to get the hang of that 
i want a lot and thirty a week wonot go very far 
-PRON- constant talk of save rather jar on -PRON- so i turn to mamie and lorena 
there i make -PRON- big mistake 
that night i plunge with -PRON- to the extent of fifteen dollar and forty cent and -PRON- call -PRON- down oh very nicely for do -PRON- i feel as though all the fun have be take out of the evening 
but always i want -PRON- to know i have a thousand thought of katie mingo where i have one of mamie or lorena how i feel deep down in -PRON- heart 
there be that in -PRON- eye at this moment which bring a vivid flush to cheek 
and when -PRON- take -PRON- hand -PRON- do not withdraw -PRON- be worry over there in lose creek canon katie whipple go on 
-PRON- see johnson blue when -PRON- be a bookkeeper at a hundred a month lose -PRON- heart to a girl name ethel the only part of -PRON- name that appear in -PRON- book 
just ethel if i have the full name and address go personally to tell ethel what happen to johnson blue 
well when blue get -PRON- million dollar from -PRON- uncle and begin have high jink with -PRON- -PRON- appear that ethel reprove -PRON- for -PRON- spendthrift habit just as -PRON- reprove -PRON- i imagine

what if -PRON- marry a well man while i be read johnson blue and see the error of -PRON- way and make a firm resolution to be different if i ever get out of that pocket 
what if wesley say katie softly -PRON- wasnot possible 
what wasnot possible demand whipple a wild suspicion stab at -PRON- heart 
why answer katie -PRON- eye lower that i could marry a well man than than -PRON- 
the wild suspicion that katie may be pledge to another at once take wing 
and will -PRON- marry -PRON- katie ask whipple have prospect now and thank to johnson blue i can be all that -PRON- father would have -PRON-

but -PRON- situation lumley be not so perilous as -PRON- appear 
those guard would never have dare to annihilate -PRON- with -PRON- electric gun 
-PRON- know too well that the vengeance of the dictator would be swift and sure 
if -PRON- man have the whole city under -PRON- control ask lumley how be -PRON- possible for any of the citizen of the period to defy -PRON- authority 
that be because -PRON- have dr kelpie explain jernyngham 
-PRON- use the doctor as a club threaten -PRON- with death if -PRON- do not give up the important post -PRON- occupy 
find -PRON- threat would not intimidate -PRON- 
smith use the doctor timemachine to go back into the past after more of -PRON- fellow 
the situation be become pretty jerry dick evolve that plot to help -PRON- escape 
-PRON- know now why -PRON- anticipate activity 
of course be not out of the wood yet by a long shot but be go to hang on to -PRON- power and prerogative great lumley for a bunch of year man to boss this year if -PRON- have a hand in the game -PRON- would know how -PRON- feel have to leave these time mile say lumley

where be the rest of -PRON- friend who escape with -PRON- -PRON- inquire and lindley be pick up by an airship belong to the department of custom kinch and mortimer be rescue by a detachment of muglug under command of jerry dick 
now that -PRON- and jefferson plunkett be account for the only man miss be dr kelpie 
i presume that -PRON- and plunkett be in the hand of the guard 
at this moment simpson begin bring in a number of cover dish and place -PRON- on the table 
the appetizing odor -PRON- bring with -PRON- be most delightful 
-PRON- final act be to place half a dozen cigar in the center of the table and push up a couple of chair

-PRON- be very certain that never in -PRON- whole life have -PRON- be so nearly famish as -PRON- be at that moment 
-PRON- pause on -PRON- way to the table startle by cry from the chartroom 
before jernyngham could investigate the cause of the commotion a short fat man come puff through the office door 
-PRON- face be red and -PRON- little eye glimmer 
in one hand -PRON- hold a small revolver of the ancient pattern and -PRON- fan the point of -PRON- back and forth so that -PRON- cover impartially jernyngham lumley and simpson

still watch the three plunkett move to the table take a chair face -PRON- and rest the elbow of -PRON- gunhand on the white linen 
now listen -PRON- go on go to have a square meal and -PRON- be go to stay right where -PRON- be and watch -PRON- eat -PRON-

cautiously jefferson plunkett lay the weapon beside -PRON- plate and proceed to relieve the very large famine that have afflict -PRON- for twentyfour hour 
lumley watch -PRON- wistfully even if a little fearfully while jernyngham look on with humorous resignation startling jefferson plunkett make a clean sweep of everything on the table 
double portion of ham and egg fry potato and toast vanish from before -PRON- like magic 
as the food disappear -PRON- complacency grow 
when the plate be empty -PRON- select a cigar sniff at -PRON- with the fastidiousness of a connoisseur smile gratefully and light -PRON- then very coolly -PRON- appropriate the rest of the cigar and stow -PRON- away in -PRON- pocket 
take -PRON- from -PRON- gentleman say -PRON- that i have just experience the pleasant part of this little dream 
-PRON- mind be begin to smooth -PRON- out and have a few lucid interval a cinch that this situation be too many for -PRON- and -PRON- another cinch that i be shanghai and push idto -PRON- against -PRON- will

-PRON- may now -PRON- add indulge in any conversation that seem appropriate

yes sir 
simpson disappear 
plunkett grab the edge of the table stare at jernyngham and -PRON- low jaw fall 
-PRON- cigar drop into a plate 
after a moment -PRON- mumble to -PRON- pick up the cigar absently and resume -PRON- smoking 
just as begin to feel tolerably comfortable say -PRON- something like this have to happen 
mr plunkett speak up lumley this gentleman be mile jernyngham of the weather bureau 
plunkett acknowledge the introduction with a scowl and a nod 
jernyngham lift -PRON- voice and call for simpson 
duplicate that breakfast order simp say -PRON- and see how quick -PRON- can do -PRON- 
-PRON- turn to plunkett 
lumley and -PRON- go on have just make up -PRON- mind that -PRON- have be recapture so -PRON- appearance here be in the nature of a pleasant surprise 
how do -PRON- get away from the guard miss kennedy attend to that answer plunkett 
-PRON- drop -PRON- through a grating in the diningroom and then lead -PRON- up to the roof in a roundabout way 
there -PRON- board the family flier 
miss kennedy let -PRON- off on top of the weather bureau and tell -PRON- to go down and look for friend 
a derisive smile dig crease in the drummer face 
and i donot think -PRON- finish that i give -PRON- a pleasant surprise when i show up here -PRON- be a surprise all right but the pleasure be mostly -PRON- get to hand -PRON- a piece of -PRON- mind mr plunkett observe jernyngham and i may as well do -PRON- right now 
i hope -PRON- will take -PRON- kindly but -PRON- have get to take -PRON- whether kindly or no 
-PRON- conduct toward those who come with -PRON- to these time have be most reprehensible 
-PRON- seem plunkett to be constantly on the lookout for opportunity to betray -PRON- companion into the hand of -PRON- enemy 
now be a little band of castaway who by -PRON- native shrewdness and ability have succeed in get a strangle hold on -PRON- environment get to hang together understand 
eternal vigilance be the price of -PRON- success 
-PRON- brother tod be the boss dictator and on -PRON- account if for no other reason -PRON- ought to be with -PRON- rather than against -PRON- 
if plunkett be impress with these blunt remark -PRON- fail to show -PRON- 
-PRON- listen to jemyngham with a derisive smile jerry to this all right say -PRON- that everything seem and that nothing really be be dope and when i come to -PRON- can bet -PRON- bottom sou marquee that go to make thing hot for the bunch that work the hocus pocus 
when i wake up i want to have the satisfaction of know that i plug for -PRON- side even while i be under the influence of that funny powder 
just at present little alice plunkett in wonderland and very very busy hunt a way back to junction where i get off 
meanwhile go to be as obstreperous as i can 
simpson come in and begin clear away the table 
lumley watch -PRON- with interest and impatience 
in fact -PRON- be so wrap up in the prospect of that delay breakfast that -PRON- could not feel properly aggrieve at the stand take ly jefferson plunkett 
jernyngham have -PRON- in mind to be very severethere be no doubt at all about thatbut before -PRON- could vent -PRON- indignation upon plunkett something else happen 
a door open and close 
footstep be hear approach hurriedly 
there be another flurry of excitement in the chartroom and kinch fling -PRON- ihto the office 
ah lumley 
kinch exclaim 
glad to see -PRON- jernyngham 
excuse brevity but in the big kind of a rush 
get an airship on the roof and just drop in for a moment to have a word with lumley try to corral all of -PRON- crowd at the office of the chief dictator 
mortimer ripley and be there and lumley be to join -PRON- at once off to get dr kelpie 
how do -PRON- know i be here inquire lumley 
the news come by transmit from kennedy have -PRON- find dr kelpie hear from -PRON- 
the information be bring by one of the guard who be bribe by the doctor 
kelpie be recapture but while -PRON- be free -PRON- manage to hide the timeball now -PRON- s back in the old quarter in amsterdam avenue with the guard double and -PRON- be go to use the thinkograph on -PRON- and discover where -PRON- secrete the main part of the timemachine get to prevent that 
dick be march a strong force of muglug at the doublequick to the kelpie house and need there to direct proceeding 
a sound of quick movement draw all eye toward the office door 
jefferson plunkett be just make a hasty exit 
come back here shout kinch 
be hang to -PRON- flung back plunkett look around and flourish -PRON- revolver 
try to stop -PRON- and shoot not get the want -PRON- -PRON- 
-PRON- slam the door leave those in the office stare at each other in apprehension and dismay 
confound the fellow grunt jernyngham 
not that this timeball count for much so far as the dictator be concern but -PRON- count for more than -PRON- know cry the exasperate detective 
i wish bring that electric gun 
as -PRON- happen i havenot a weapon of any sort but not let that stand in the way 
with that -PRON- fling open the door of the chartroom 
the operator be huddle in one corner like a lot of frightened sheep 
through the open door of the tuberoom jefferson plunkett could be see puff and flounder on the flight of iron stair that lead to the roof 
follow by lumley and jernyngham kinch plunge on in fierce pursuit 
by the time the three reach the foot of the stair plunkett be out of the roofdoor and by the time the pursuer reach the roof the machine that have bring the detective be on the wing plunkett balance amidship and cover the pilot with -PRON- revolver 
as -PRON- slip swiftly away into space the hardware drummer give vent to a wheezy taunt laugh 
if -PRON- get that timeball cry the panicstricken lumley hell destroy -PRON- 
-PRON- doesnot know -PRON- doesnot understand get to overhaul -PRON- exclaim kinch another flyingmachine 
i say there jernyngham get to have another machine 
jernyngham be haul a red flag to the top of a short staff signal for a municipal flier say -PRON- 
ah ha there s one now head this way 
the municipal machine which pay a license to the air ship department and be for hire round gracefully to a pause above the roof and then settle down into the stay 
kinch and lumley run up the step and clamber aboard 
follow that craft shout kinch point south toward the other airship 
the pilot start -PRON- helicopter and then when -PRON- be swinge well over the roof turn on the propeller doublecross this little game of declare the detective with grim determination 
by what process of reasoning have -PRON- convince -PRON- that -PRON- can get that timeball anyhow why -PRON- s plain crazy there be no doubt of that plain troublesome jasper return lumley and -PRON- seem to have a way of do the wrong thing with a good deal of success 
plunkett the avenger be surely an appropriate name for -PRON- 
i have awful foreboding that -PRON- be on the point of do something rash something that will result in a tremendous catastrophe 
-PRON- forget frowned kinch that plunkett be match wit with -PRON- 
thereupon -PRON- break off the conversation give attention to the chase and urge the driver to crowd on more power 
two thing be evident to those in the municipal flier 
one be that the driver be do everything possible to get the good speed out of the machine and the other be that -PRON- be barely hold -PRON- own in the chase overload say the driver a man of the period cry kinch fiercely and on peril of -PRON- life tell -PRON- the truth be -PRON- for or against the dictator 
be there any reason for -PRON- to keep this airship back the driver shiver under the deadly menace of the detective voice and look no quarrel with the dictator -PRON- whimper 
if i have why should i hold this machine back 
the man be chase be one of -PRON- crowd 
i tell -PRON- sir be overload 
kinch appear convinced of the driver sincerity 
never slow in make up -PRON- mind -PRON- have plan the next step before the pilot have do speak 
hover over that roof ahead there -PRON- order point 
stop but donot land 
come to a standstill two or three foot above the landingstage 
very well sir 
sorry lumley say kinch but the craft be overload and -PRON- will have to drop out on that roof and wait until i finish the chase and come back and pick -PRON- up 
but be sure and wait 
all of -PRON- crowd must be get together and keep together bag plunkett and well halt -PRON- troublesome career by keep -PRON- bind and under lock and key 
by lighten ship -PRON- shall be able to overhaul the craft ahead 
lumley be disappointed but -PRON- have the utmost confidence in kinch and promptly fall in with -PRON- plan 
the helicopter be hold the municipal machine a few foot above the landingstage of the strange rooftop 
lumley climb over the side lower -PRON- to arm length and drop 
-PRON- land lightly easily and then watch while the airship resume the chase 
i hope nothing go wrong -PRON- say to -PRON- turn to the edge of the platform and descend a short flight of step to the roof 
if the timeball fall into the hand of -PRON- enemy there s no tell where -PRON- trouble will end 
-PRON- worry on the score of dr kelpie and the timeball have cause -PRON- to forget for the time be that -PRON- have be deprive of the morning meal of which -PRON- stand very much in need 
now that -PRON- have be eliminate from the chase and -PRON- attendant excitement -PRON- mind return wistfully to the subject of -PRON- lose breakfast 
a sort of pergola hard by the landing stage and offer a shelter of flower vine invite -PRON- 
-PRON- enter -PRON- cool shadow and sit down on a cushioned bench 
by a supreme effort of the will -PRON- seek to banish vision of ham and egg fry potato toast and coffee 
as a means to the end -PRON- steer -PRON- thought in other channel 
-PRON- be clear that the member of the rescue society be go to have a hard time pry the dictator loose from -PRON- power and prerogative and carry -PRON- back into the past 
yet -PRON- must be do in some way 
-PRON- have no moral right to tyrannize over the folk of the twentyfirst century 
people of different age be differently constitute 
how would the people of the year have feel if some usurper have come on from the year banish the telegraph for the post rider and retire incandescent bulb in favor of tallowdip 
no no 
surely a man have no right to any other era than that in which -PRON- be bear 
the castaway perhaps not maliciously be perpetrate a great wrong and lumley be grieve to note that a sordid spirit have enter into -PRON- operation and that -PRON- be manipulate the weather the culinary operation and no doubt everything else for -PRON- own financial benefit 
this reflection be cut short 
what be that -PRON- hear 
a groan 
-PRON- start to -PRON- foot and listen intently 
yes there be no mistake 
here be something that demand investigation 
midway of the pergolas length be the builtup hood that shelter the roofdoor 
lumley observe that the door be ajar and -PRON- be not long in determine that the gruesome sound -PRON- have hear be waft through the opening 
cautiously -PRON- advance to the door push -PRON- wide and step through 
descend the broad stairway a short distance -PRON- look over the balustrade and an odd scene reveal -PRON- to -PRON- 
the room into which -PRON- have partly descend be the triclinium or diningroom of the household 
-PRON- be a very rich apartment with wall fresco by the hand of some master artist and with chair and couch upholstered in the costly fabric 
the grating through which the food vapor be will not to ascend be of yellow gold work out in an intricate and graceful design 
on one side of this grating stand a tablea breakfasttable as -PRON- werebrought from some peasant hut and put down in those luxurious surrounding 
-PRON- be cover with a paper cloth and the dish be of tin evidently design for other use and press into service by sudden necessity 
there be a bowlshape dish half full of a dark liquid 
at half a dozen place around the board be plate heap with food a sort of food lumley could not remember ever have see before 
six chair be push back from the table 
those who have be eat be lie on couch or be writhe in chair fill with a misery that find vent in heartwrenche groan 
lumley grasp the situation in a moment 
this be the result of decree these people of the period be try to carry out the term of the new law 
for year -PRON- have sit at -PRON- golden grating converse pleasantly and absorb -PRON- nutrition 
now -PRON- be try to eat the solid nonvaporize nondeodorized food and the result could not be otherwise than painful heart go out to the sufferer even as -PRON- indignation wax strong against the dictator 
-PRON- be a brutal decree 
famish as -PRON- be however the sight of that breakfast tempt -PRON- 
not one of the six member of the household pay -PRON- the slight attention and -PRON- descend quietly draw up one of the chair and sit down at the table 
-PRON- pick up a fragment of something try to determine what -PRON- be by sight and then by taste 
-PRON- be hard and soggy and burn 
-PRON- drop -PRON- 
yes -PRON- be hungry than -PRON- have ever be in -PRON- life but -PRON- couldnot go that 
eat -PRON- command a hollow voice 
-PRON- be call bread in the cookbook 
-PRON- be from those distant time and -PRON- ask a demonstration 
prove to -PRON- that the stuff be edible 
lumley look up 
the man of the house evidently be stand before -PRON- 
-PRON- absurd costume in nowise diminish the touching spectacle -PRON- present 
the pinch face and feverish eye be mute evidence of starvation 
-PRON- dear friend return lumley with feeling i would put up with a good deal of personal inconvenience to eat this bread if -PRON- be possible 
but -PRON- isnot 
-PRON- cook have make a botch of the baking 
try one of those chop beg the man there beside the bread 
chop echo lumley 
these be not chop -PRON- be clinker burn to a cinder 
no one could eat those thing 
have some of the coffee 
lumley try -PRON- and strangle 
i canot -PRON- sputter like to oblige -PRON- if i could but there s a limit to what i can stand even when ravenous 
so come from the other bitterly 
-PRON- be order by these usurper to eat food that even -PRON- can not endure and -PRON- have always be eater while -PRON- have become absorber 
-PRON- nature be delicately attune to the beautiful and the progressive in life and the coarseness of the act of mastication revolt -PRON- even as the odor of the solid food be offensive 
mark -PRON- word decree will prove the undoing of these usurper 
where do -PRON- come from query another voice 
lumley look around 
all the male member of the household four of themwere on -PRON- foot 
the mother and daughter have lift -PRON- on -PRON- couch and be stare at lumley with reproachful eye 
lumley explain that -PRON- have be set down on the roof by a friend and be to be pick up later 
-PRON- be one of the recent arrival 
while on the roof -PRON- have hear groan and out of a desire to relieve a fellow creature distress -PRON- have intrude into the triclinium 
-PRON- hope -PRON- would pardon -PRON- 
-PRON- feel for -PRON- deeply and be sorry -PRON- be powerless to be of any help 
if thy would excuse -PRON- -PRON- would go back to the roof again and wait for -PRON- friend airship 
one of the son spring to the wall and pull a switch 
the roofdoor could be hear to close 
i open that door say the young man so that -PRON- could get the air 
now -PRON- be closed and fasten 
well do exclaim the head of the house 
send a transmit to the headquarters of the opposition one of -PRON- 
-PRON- will turn this man over to -PRON- 
then and for the first time lumley realize that -PRON- generous desire to aid the distressed have plunge -PRON- into trouble 
to get to the roof be impossible 
the elevator opening be in the wall behind -PRON- and -PRON- start up and retreat toward -PRON- 
all the time -PRON- be execute -PRON- retreat toward the elevator -PRON- be plead with -PRON- enraged foe for -PRON- kindly consideration 
one of the son be take down an electric rifle from the wall 
mother and daughter clasped in each other arm be on the verge of hysteria 
but the father torture into fury by decree be eager for hostility 
just as the young man turn with the electric rifle lumley fall backward into the elevator cage 
-PRON- fall body touch the spring that release the car and -PRON- shoot downward at the foot of the shaft -PRON- regain -PRON- foot and plunge through an open door 
-PRON- be on the ground floor of the house and above -PRON- -PRON- could hear sound of wildest commotiontransmit shout to the opposition scream of woman wild shout of the man a patter of foot on broad staircase 
lumley gain a massive street door only to find -PRON- lock 
what be there to do 
-PRON- fight with the door and as -PRON- struggle -PRON- call wildly for help 
-PRON- call -PRON- frantically reason be as useless as -PRON- attempt to open the door 
yet -PRON- must do something and instinctively -PRON- continue to shout and wrench at the barrier with all -PRON- strength 
suddenly there be a crash a ring impact as of a ton of steel hurl against the door on -PRON- outer side 
the stout wood shiver and all but yield 
again come the thunderous attack and this time the door be burst inward 
lumley be fling backward to the floor 
as -PRON- lie there -PRON- have a glimpse of a warrior muglug charge through the breach 
the steel giant bent over lumley lift -PRON- as easily as though -PRON- have be an infant fling -PRON- across one shoulder and make off with -PRON- 
outside the house another muglug of the warrior class join the first and shoulder to shoulder the two rattle and clang -PRON- way down the street 
the relief lumley may otherwise have feel be cloud with uncertainty 
-PRON- be hold to the muglug shoulder by a viselike grip of the iron hand and every attempt -PRON- make to free -PRON- be meet with firm resistance 
the two muglug be at large 
be -PRON- dependable or have -PRON- rebel against the authority of jerry dick and go on a bit of a rampage 
lumley could only wait and worry and hope for the good 
five minute after lumley have be rescue from the house where edict have cause so much distress -PRON- be bear into a great building that fairly roar with activity 
on every hand steel be smite steel and the din be terrific 
muglug be at work build other muglug 
the steel mechanic be divide into group and each group have -PRON- own particular piecework 
here be a dozen or so shape fit and rivet the metal head just beyond these be the torsoworker farther along be the toiler who hinge and joint the wonderful arm and hand over on the right be those whose business -PRON- be to fashion the leg and foot and make perfect the clever joint at thigh knee and ankle and then last of all be the assemble frame where each part be bring together and the complete muglug stamp with a number and lay aside for test and final approval 
lumley over the iron shoulder of the muglug who be carry -PRON- survey the establishment with wonder and admiration 
-PRON- have lose -PRON- fear for the arrival at the factory have convince -PRON- that although the steel warrior be at large -PRON- be by no mean proceed at random 
reassure as to -PRON- own personal safety -PRON- survey the plant with interest as -PRON- be carry through -PRON- 
pass out of the huge workshop the two muglug cross a glassy plot and enter a small building 
lumley be place in a chair and the metal giant who have bring -PRON- range -PRON- side by side along the wall and lift -PRON- hand to -PRON- forehead 
a towheaded usurper of perhaps twentyfive sit at a table in front of a number of blueprint and receive the salute

as two toiler from the workshop be carry away the defective muglug a glitter airship hover suddenly over the grassy sward between the office and the factory then drop lightly and swiftly into the factory hangar 
through the open door of the office lumley could see a determinedlooking man step out of the craft and come down the hangar step 
on either side of -PRON- march a warrior muglug overlay with gold and silver filigreework and arm with an electric rifle 
now what s up remark grant in a puzzled tone the chief dictator and -PRON- isnot due to inspect the plant for a week yet wrong that s a cinch

the castaway have get a stranglehold on the time old chap and be out for reform with a big a job wait for -PRON- and as soon as i get the transmit from the muglug factory give news of -PRON- whereabout i climb into the meteor and fly over this way 
say lumley -PRON- will never want to leave want to cast in -PRON- lot with -PRON- and become one of the dictator 
all the other who come with -PRON- have accept place of power and -PRON- couldnot think of leave -PRON- out that ask lumley thinking -PRON- have not hear aright

ah dr kelpie dr kelpie who could have believe -PRON- of -PRON- 
but stay 
lumley have one think like a forlorn hope 
tod say -PRON- what office have -PRON- give -PRON- brother jefferson 
i havenot see jefferson as yet be the reply but i shall certainly have a good dictatorship for jeff 
as for -PRON- lumley what more fitting than that -PRON- should be supervisor general of the subconscious ray 
-PRON- can have a blue and gold office in the head center building and make sure that the ray be at all time efficient and properly direct no chance for graft but what s the odd all -PRON- picking be throw into a common fund and when -PRON- have have enough of the game well split even 
what do -PRON- say lumley have not the slight intention of ally -PRON- with the freebooter 
-PRON- be consecrate to the one purpose of rescue all of -PRON- from -PRON- reprehensible career and restore -PRON- to sphere of respectable activity in -PRON- own time 
but if -PRON- gain -PRON- end against such overwhelming odd -PRON- must proceed warily have to think about -PRON- tod -PRON- say 
i canot give -PRON- an answer offhand

hustle the work here archibald say -PRON- 
every capable muglug -PRON- turn out be another rivet in the fabric of -PRON- power 
the strong -PRON- be the farther -PRON- can go and the farther -PRON- go the more successful -PRON- information 
by work night and day tod reply grant -PRON- can turn out on an average twentyfive mug test and every twentyfour hour 
only about one in ten be defective 
good work 
keep -PRON- up be around for regular weekly inspection on saturday next 
all ready lumley 
the two product de luxe of the muglug factory especially construct for the chief dictator bodyguard march back to the gleam airship as -PRON- have march away from itflanke -PRON- august master

adrift in the unknown queer adventure in a queer realm by author of the special game in the web -PRON- friend the enemy etc seventh avenue new york splendid interesting big story for the present the adventure library will be devote to the publication of story by william wallace cook 
the fact that one man write all of these story in no way detract from -PRON- interest as -PRON- be all very different in plot and locality 
for example the action in one story take place in the land of little rain another deal with adventure on the high sea another be a good railroad story other be splendid western story and some be mystery story 
all of -PRON- however be story of vigorous adventure draw true to life which give -PRON- the thrill that all really good fiction should have 
copyright by frank munsey co adrift in the unknown print in the united state of america lose stray or steal 
an uninvited guest professor feat the plutocrat reconcile travel sunward a landing effect face a mercurial storm the mercurial learn the wordbox how -PRON- be catalogue the dilemma of mr meig condemn to death a threatening calamity plan to steal a building survey -PRON- own planet how illluck overtake -PRON- a change of heart how -PRON- outwit the king back to earth there could be no more fitting introduction to this most amazing narrative from the pen of jame peter munn than that article in the morning mercury 
munn -PRON- be no breach of confidence to inform the reader be a reformed burglar although the author of two book which achieve large sale and be most favorably receive by the way of crack safe and the manualmr 
munn develop small skill with the pen so that the breathless interest arouse by -PRON- revelation hang more upon the matter than the style 
the mercury article should do -PRON- mite toward prepare the reader for what be to come 
in the first place the story be what newspaper man call a scoop 
the article in the first edition run as follow a a what happen to professor quinn last night 
and what happen to the strange steel structure know locally among harlem resident as castle 
for quinn and -PRON- castle be snuff out like a candlegleam some time between the hour of eleven oclock and midnight 
patrolman casey who travel a beat in that part of harlem aver that -PRON- pass the castle at eleven oclock and that -PRON- be there -PRON- pass -PRON- site again at twelve and -PRON- be not there 
considerably exercise patrolman casey make search for the castle and although -PRON- beat up the country for a dozen block in all direction -PRON- fail to find -PRON- 
and what be more patrolman casey declare that -PRON- take the pledge when -PRON- go on the force and have be a total abstainer ever since 
corroboration of the officer report be not lack 
certain resident of the vicinity state that -PRON- see the professor weird dwell yesterday evening -PRON- window be aglow and -PRON- appear evident that the professor be entertaining friend 
the first gray dawn this morning show a bare lot with the steel house miss 
be -PRON- another case of palace dissolving into thin air at the presto of some wonder worker 
or be -PRON- a plain case of larceny undertake on a gigantic scale 
a golden opportunity offer -PRON- to a sleuth of the sherlock holme school and for such a person the mercury present the follow fact first the socalled castle be projectileshape of boilerplate construction and measure some twenty foot in diameter tapering to a point thirty foot above ground 
-PRON- be cover with a sort of paint that give -PRON- the appearance of frost silver 
second there be much low shrubbery surround the site of the castle and if the castle have be blow down and roll from the ridge -PRON- stand on into the river there would have be leave evidence in plenty of such disaster 
note the castle certainly weigh five ton possibly five time that 
nothing short of a cyclone could have budge -PRON- and there be hardly a breath of air stir the whole night long 
third professor quinn ever since -PRON- erect -PRON- steel house and move into -PRON- have be regard as mildly insane 
like -PRON- desire to be enter on the angelic scroll as one who love -PRON- fellowman 
last summer -PRON- read before the astronomical society a paper entitle the mutability of newtonian law and be laugh out of that honorable body for -PRON- inconsistency 
although advert to as the harlem sage professor quinn be no merlin nor do -PRON- possess the ring of gyge that render -PRON- wearer invisible 
yet where be -PRON- 
and where be -PRON- castle 
until some vidocq appear and solve the mystery echo can only answer where 
so much for the article in the first printing of the paper 
the bright young man who stand sponsor for the scoop have meanwhile be very busy with fresh detail and the second edition contain the follow addenda -PRON- have just be learn that mr emmet gilhooly the multimillionaire and president of the railroad combine be a guest of professor quinn last night and must have be in the castle at the very moment -PRON- fade into oblivion 
mr gilhooly do not return to -PRON- home and have not since be hear from 
-PRON- relative be distracted and lead railroad man of the country be in a panic 
-PRON- absence from affair at the present moment jeopardize the traction interest of the entire country and may prove a deathblow to the success of the gigantic pool -PRON- be form 
this be startling news indeed and speed hither and yon throughout the city the country and the civilized world 
appal as the information be nevertheless -PRON- prove merely a fractional part of the truth 
the bright reporter on the mercury make further discovery which be print in the third edition rush from the press of -PRON- paper 
not only be mr emmet gilhooly a guest of professor quinn in the steel castle last night but so also be hon 
augustus popham the coal baron archibald meig of wall street late manipulator of the corner in wheat and now engineer a corner in cotton and hannibal markham well know as the instigator of a plot to control the food supply of the united state 
what have become of these four millionaire and napoleon of finance 
-PRON- have go with quinn and -PRON- castle disappearing as utterly as though the earth have open and swallow -PRON- 
fabulous reward be offer by the relative of the miss millionaire for any information relative to the fate that have overtake -PRON- 
foul play be suspect and the financial world stand aghast and dumbly wonder what be to happen to the business of the country if -PRON- really develop beyond all peradventure that gilhooly popham meig and markham have be eliminate from commercial affair 
the influence of these four be vast and farreaching and -PRON- be scheme to make -PRON- grip on the republic resource even more secure and relentless 
if -PRON- plan carry no man could eat or clothe -PRON- or warm -PRON- body and drive -PRON- manufacturing engine or travel from place to place and ship the product of -PRON- mill without pay tribute to gilhooly popham meig and markham 
should those scheme titanic in conception be work out to -PRON- manifest conclusion four man would hold the destiny of industrial america in the hollow of -PRON- hand 
prosperity would wait upon -PRON- pleasure or at a mere nod would be paralyze and leave the country strand on the reef of disaster 
-PRON- seem an odd fatality that at the very time these of industry be plot to make -PRON- power complete -PRON- should have vanish as utterly as though -PRON- have be engulf by a tidal wave and sweep into the broad region of the atlantic 
a few fact be bring to light through the probing of skilled detective mind but these fact be in nowise clue to the fate that have overtake the millionaire confidential aide reluctantly admit that -PRON- chief have accept an invitation from quinn and have go to -PRON- castle for an interview 
quinn profess to have make some discovery or other which -PRON- declare would make coal a useless commodity so far as human need be concern 
popham while laugh at pretension be nevertheless secretly worried 
anything that threaten the success of the coup which be be engineer by -PRON- and -PRON- three confrere be to be deal with decisively and without loss of time 
in the case of meigs markham and gilhooly there be no confidential aide to offer testimony for these bright particular star of high finance have place a limit on the confidence repose in -PRON- secretary 
nevertheless the probe mind at work on the case develop the extraordinary fact that these man no less than popham have visit quinn at the latter request 
a spirit of scoff investigation animate -PRON- but -PRON- be prepared to see with -PRON- own eye and hear with -PRON- own ear whatever quinn have to show and to say 
if anything that militate against -PRON- project coup be bring before -PRON- -PRON- would proceed to lay the spectre forthwith 
strangely enough the shrewd of the detective fail to connect the disappearance of the millionaire with the comprehensive plan -PRON- be form and which could not be carry out except by the plotter in person 
other rich man of the country who be will not to trim -PRON- sail in accordance with whatever wind blow from the office of the four in wall street be already shift affair to lay a course that would give -PRON- the good headway against the project new order 
this sudden disappearance of the power to which the less rich look for guidance leave -PRON- becalm in an uncharted sea 
the middle class long accustom to be mulct right and leave accept the astonishing situation with equanimity 
so far as -PRON- be concern gilhooly popham meig and markham be abstract generalitiesmerely name to conjure with 
for year the middle class have pay for the conjuring and have be teach to look calmly into the eye of what -PRON- have come to believe be the inevitable 
if -PRON- annual outing to the seashore or the mountain cost too much -PRON- could stay at home if the butcher the baker and the grocer run price too high some of the luxury could be cut out if anthracite go to a ton -PRON- would heat few room and if clothing become too expensive there would be few suit and gown to wear 
by a little selfdenial the middle class also could trim -PRON- sail to any gale that blow 
-PRON- be use to -PRON- 
with the poor -PRON- be different 
-PRON- be already down to bedrock in the way of selfdenial 
no sooner have -PRON- drift through -PRON- brain that the influence of gilhooly popham meig and markham have be blot out than -PRON- lift -PRON- voice in praise of the blessed event 
-PRON- situation have be bad enough and any change among the vaguely understand cause preside over -PRON- affair could hardly be for the bad 
the detective feel that -PRON- be at work on a particularly complex case hamper -PRON- by look for complex cause 
at first -PRON- believe -PRON- be a matter of sequestration and that presently a ransom in seven or eight figure would be call for 
however a delving into past fail to reveal any lawless action that would point to a ransom in -PRON- present line of endeavor 
the detective grow more complex as the ambiguity close -PRON- in overlook entirely the simplicity of character 
anyhow one analytical mind would demand of another what have intention to do with the disappearance 
that be a positive reality 
and although -PRON- be surmise -PRON- be not definitely know that quinn -PRON- have have anything to do with -PRON- 
such be the situation confront the country and with which the police department of new york city be call upon to deal 
but the keen reason inductive or deductive be powerless to find even a clue 
the tremendous mystery may have remain a mystery until this day have -PRON- not be for the narrative of jame peter munn now for the first time give to the world 
i use to be one of those who claim that the world owe -PRON- a living and i go out with a drill and a jimmy to collect -PRON- 
where be the difference i argue between the man who crack -PRON- strong box and remove a few paltry bill or coin and the nabob who skulk behind a trust and take -PRON- tax on the necessity of life 
this be pure sophistry of course but i become wed to -PRON- in early life and that i escape a suit of stripe and measurement on the bertillon system be due entirely to -PRON- experience with professor quinn 
twa a blessed night that send -PRON- to -PRON- castle with the view of mulct -PRON- of treasure i feel to be there 
quinn be a queer one 
i do not mean to say that -PRON- be unhinge as some thought but -PRON- be queer in -PRON- outlook upon life and in resource which fall under the head of way and mean 
-PRON- castle claim -PRON- professional attention 
for why should a man build a big steel vault and live in -PRON- unless -PRON- have portable property worth a burglar while 
i reconnoiter the place for a week before i consider -PRON- possess of sufficient knowledge for -PRON- undertaking 
in view of what transpire at the time of -PRON- visit a brief description of the castle take from -PRON- memorandum book will prove of interest 
the structure be cigarshape twentynine foot from base to apex and twenty foot in diameter through -PRON- large part 
-PRON- be divide into two story by mean of a steel floor leave headroom of ten foot in the low story 
four window pierce the circular wall of the neth room and two give light to the room above these six opening be guard on the outer side with latticework of steel 
the door be an oblong piece of boiler platethe entire building be a shell compose of plate rivet togetherhinge heavily and provide with a strong lock 
as i have yet to find a lock which i could not pick if give time enough -PRON- design naturally centre about the door 
i have hit upon the somewhat early hour of ten in the evening for -PRON- call at the professor 
unless business keep -PRON- abroad i know that -PRON- be usually in bed long before that time 
if -PRON- chance to be out so much the well for the success of -PRON- foray 
after the patrolman have pass i creep through the bush and be soon busy with the lock on the steel door 
-PRON- yield with much less resistance than i have anticipate and i be quickly within flash -PRON- lantern about -PRON- 
a circular seat upholstered in leather run around the wall and a table bear an unlighted oil lamp stand in the centre of the floor 
i have barely complete a hasty survey when a crunch of footstep on the gravel walk without smote on -PRON- ear 
without loss of a moment i snap the lantern shut and dart up the iron stairway to the room above 
-PRON- be needless to say that i be very much put out because of the interruption 
i be a hard man in those day and such an occurrence be apt to anger -PRON- and make -PRON- say thing 
lie flat on the floor with -PRON- face to the stair opening i have a fairly good view of the circular chamber below 
the professor have be abroad and not in bed for -PRON- appear now usher in caller 
four gentleman all of distinguished mien and important bearing follow the owner of the castle and begin glance about with illconceale amusement 
gad but this be an odd place exclaim one 
this gentleman wear a frock coat and silk hat but what catch -PRON- eye be a fourcarat spark in -PRON- scarf a massive seal on -PRON- fob and a scintillating gem on the third finger of -PRON- left hand 
odd perhaps return the professor but most suitable to -PRON- purpose mr gilhooly as i hope to show -PRON- before many minute have pass 
be seat sir 
and the rest of -PRON- gentleman -PRON- will find the divan most comfortable 
gilhooly 
i go hot and cold at that name 
nearly everybody in new york be just then talk about the man who be scheme to make railroad travel too expensive for ordinary mortal 
-PRON- be a millionaire several time over and in the breast of -PRON- frock coat i know there must be a bulky wallet 
at once and while i watch and listen to those in the room below -PRON- mind busy -PRON- with detail of a more comprehensive operation than i have at first contemplate 
the professor four guest have seat -PRON- on the circular divan 
after -PRON- eye have finish with gilhooly -PRON- turn on the other three and -PRON- first impression be more than confirm 
each of the quartet be a croesus and dressed and strut the part 
fine bird indeed and i hug -PRON- to think how opportunity have come knock at -PRON- door in hand i could descend upon this covey compel a readjustment of value between -PRON- and -PRON- then back through the steel door lock -PRON- behind -PRON- and make off 
the professor intent on other thing no doubt have turn -PRON- key in the lock and have fail to discover that the bolt be already throw therefore -PRON- presence in the castle be entirely unsuspectedmanifestly an advantage 
-PRON- have ask -PRON- to come here professor quinn speak up one as the professor turn higher the wick of the lamp -PRON- have just light and here -PRON- be 
-PRON- say -PRON- have discover something whose value to science and the industrial world be beyond compute and that -PRON- wish to interest capital the speaker survey -PRON- three companion with a large be the capital shall come at -PRON- discovery in due course mr popham say the professor who be a wiry little man with a bald head and beadlike black eye thank -PRON- for come here 
emmet gilhooly augustus popham archibald meig and hannibal markham be star of the first magnitude in the sky of speculation and i esteem -PRON- fortunate in arouse -PRON- interest 
a faintness seize -PRON- as these name each an open sesame to the world of finance fall glibly from the professor tongue 
i be all but cheek by jowl with representative of billion 
augustus popham turn -PRON- head to give emmet gilhooly a plebeian wink 
gilhooly smile behind -PRON- smooth white hand 
archibald meig lean over to whisper something to hannibal markham who be affix a pair of gold eyeglass to -PRON- roman nose whereupon both gentleman suppress a titter 
a doubt of the sincerity of all four break over -PRON- 
-PRON- be there to have sport with this bald little man with the beady eye and the bee in -PRON- bonnet 
i chuckle grimly as i think of how the table would presently be turn 
i do not know whether the professor be as keen as i to detect these evidence of insincerity 
if -PRON- be -PRON- give no sign be sixtyfive say -PRON- and -PRON- life work have be the discovery which i be about to bring to -PRON- august attention 
perhaps some of -PRON- gentleman have read -PRON- paper on the mutability of newtonian law 
the gentleman acknowledge that -PRON- have not 
professor quinn seem disappointed 
if -PRON- have read that -PRON- continue -PRON- would have prepare yourself for an understanding of -PRON- theory and the demonstration of -PRON- which i be about to give 
let -PRON- ask -PRON- this when an apple leave -PRON- parent branch why be -PRON- that -PRON- fall downward instead of upward 
the napoleon of finance stare at one another 
archibald meig go so far as to tap a suggestive finger against -PRON- forehead 
gravity say the professor 
-PRON- be that which draw every atom on the surface of the earth directly toward the earth centre -PRON- be that which chain -PRON- foot to this planet and keep -PRON- from fall through interstellar space -PRON- be even that which keep -PRON- little world from fly apart and dissipate -PRON- in dust throughout the great void 
-PRON- be a simple proposition simply state and i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
-PRON- do follow -PRON- and so signified 
in the paper i read before the astronomical society pursue the professor make bold to declare that -PRON- be possible to insulate a body against the force of gravitation 
in other word to make -PRON- so immune from newtonian law that -PRON- would spurn the earth and fall from -PRON- at a speed even great than the draw power of gravity 
can -PRON- not comprehend what this mean cry quinn waxing eloquent 
-PRON- mean a new force in the industrial worlda power that feed on nothing save a law that transcend that of gravitation 
in point of fact -PRON- fall little short of perpetual motion 
without the expenditure of even a pound of coal this new force can turn the wheel of every railroad train on the globe 
with -PRON- own inherent energy -PRON- can give life to the machinery of flour mill cotton mill iron foundry -PRON- can augustus popham get up hurriedly and put on -PRON- hat rattlebrained idea sir -PRON- exclaim have no mind to remain here and listen to such talk coal mine ravage the earth crust in a thousand and one place 
the idea that human industry could get along without -PRON- coal be too much for -PRON- 
before -PRON- could reach the door professor quinn be in front of -PRON- bar -PRON- way 
remember mr popham say the professor if i be to take away -PRON- mine i should yet give -PRON- something in -PRON- place worth incalculably more 
hear -PRON- out sir 
i beg of -PRON- 
theory be cheap thing mutter popham as -PRON- again seat -PRON- 
an ounce of proof be worth a pound of theory 
exactly cry quinn and the ounce of proof shall be forthcome 
with that -PRON- pull the table from the centre of the room reveal an iron chain some three foot in length attach at -PRON- low end to a staple in the floor by mean of a clevi and pin 
the chain be not lie loosely but be rigidly upright -PRON- upper end wind about a white blocka sixinch cube as i judge 
climb to the table top the professor step thence to the cube poise -PRON- for a moment on one foot 
then -PRON- spring to the floor again 
this cube -PRON- explain lay one hand on the block with an affectionate gesture be of steel and have be treat with -PRON- insulating compound 
to all appearance -PRON- be fall upward with a force sufficient to draw the chain rigidly to -PRON- full extent and to support -PRON- weight 
poppycock mutter the coal baron trick exclaim meig 
the other two remain silent 
-PRON- be bewilder perhaps impress 
let -PRON- see whether -PRON- be a trick or no go on quinn 
pray come forward gentleman and lay hold of the chain 
there be no danger in the little experiment with which i be go to amuse -PRON- and i think -PRON- will dispel -PRON- doubt 
the gentleman hesitate but finally come forward get down with some difficulty and grasp the chain as direct 
hold tight exclaim the professor and draw the pin from the clevi 
thus release the cube rise to the ceiling lift the four gentleman with -PRON- 
-PRON- hang in midair until quinn draw the table under -PRON- and -PRON- drop to -PRON- top each in turn and so reach the floor 
bewilderment be write large in the face of the quartet -PRON- credulity struggle against the evidence of -PRON- sense 
-PRON- be a good magician sir aver popham brush the damp from -PRON- forehead with a handkerchief 
-PRON- could make -PRON- fortune as an entertainer declare gilhooly 
archibald meig chew briskly on an unlighted cigar while hannibal markham keep -PRON- eye on the cube and dangle chain like one fascinate 
-PRON- be the fate of a man who make startling discovery to be class among disciple in black art observe quinn calmly 
what be the hour mr gilhooly -PRON- ask 
the head of the railway pool consult -PRON- repeater -PRON- reply 
and high time i be go add popham 
just a few moment more say the professor 
turn to the wall behind -PRON- -PRON- catch a small lever and turn -PRON- over as far as -PRON- would go 
the castle vibrate slightly communicate a perceptible swaying motion to the pendent chain this cry markham jump up 
do not be alarm -PRON- friend cry quinn whirl around 
-PRON- face be pallid as death and -PRON- beady eye gleam like coal 
then wonder of wonder the white cube settle to the floor 
ha shouted popham 
-PRON- antigravity compound be not very long live -PRON- seem to -PRON- 
-PRON- will find differently to -PRON- cost return the professor through -PRON- tooth 
augustus popham kenward quinn arraign -PRON- and emmet gilhooly and archibald meig and hannibal markham as foe of the human race 
-PRON- be leech who would suck the lifeblood from the vein of the poor with steady forefinger quinn have transfix each of the plutocrat as -PRON- call -PRON- name 
markham be already on -PRON- foot and the other three be not slow in follow -PRON- this what s this gasp gilhooly 
an insult mutter popham 
the old addlepate be not accountable for what -PRON- say or do remark archibald meig 
-PRON- have best leave this steel trap of -PRON- while there be yet time counsel markham 
while there be yet time repeat quinn with a wild laugh pretty set of conspirator -PRON- be on -PRON- soul 
markham there would raise the price of food until the poor would go hungry -PRON- meig would so manipulate the cost of clothing that -PRON- would not have the wherewithal to cover -PRON- nakedness popham would make fuel a luxury of the rich and gilhooly would so boost passenger and freight rate as to quadruple to the consumer the tremendous cost of the necessity of life 
deny -PRON- if -PRON- can if -PRON- dare 
quinn look like a nemesis as -PRON- confront the four man and lash -PRON- with -PRON- scorpion whip of word 
fiddlededee exclaimed popham 
-PRON- deserve -PRON- say meig for -PRON- be the height of folly for -PRON- to come here in the first place 
be this why -PRON- bring -PRON- here ask markham to air -PRON- own particular idea on sociology and to make -PRON- the victim of -PRON- abuse 
the professor throw back -PRON- head and straighten -PRON- shoulder 
-PRON- be the real thing in dignity that -PRON- show those plutocrat and -PRON- nerve tingle with admiration 
i be sorry i have come to the castle with design oh portable property and doubly glad that i could force tribute from these four who be badger -PRON- be not unjust aver the professor and such a thing as abuse be farth from -PRON- mind but i love the plain people the bone and sinew of this glorious republic and -PRON- arouse -PRON- indignation when the right to live and let live be trample upon by any one man or set of man 
platitude sneer popham 
to call a truth a platitude be witless argument answer quinn serenely 
be that as -PRON- may say meig -PRON- be not invite here for a debate but to witness a demonstration of what -PRON- be pleased to term a revolutionize discovery 
-PRON- have see -PRON- overcome the force of gravity go on the professor and to astute mind like yours further explanation seem uncalled for 
in destroy gravity i produce a power equal by no other force in the world 
the pull of an insulate block the size of that here -PRON- wave -PRON- hand toward the equal to the strength of a hundred horse 
develop that pull horizontally instead of vertically and -PRON- have a locomotive that run continuously without the consumption of a pound of coal 
that cry the professor -PRON- voice ring with triumph be the apotheosis of power 
gilhooly judge from -PRON- manner be the victim of uncomfortable thought meig wear a startled look and markham seem half convinced 
popham alone be brusque and uncompromising think -PRON- have well get out of here again suggest markham 
-PRON- half conviction appear to arouse some small amount of apprehension of the same opinion speak up meigs 
wait a little suggested popham and i see a gleam in -PRON- eye that mean a stroke of some kind 
once more -PRON- face quinn have no patience with -PRON- harebrained theory -PRON- go on and i have see charlatan work great wonder than what -PRON- be pleased to call -PRON- demonstration 
but -PRON- be a business principle of -PRON- to buy up these promising theory if -PRON- happen to run counter to any pet scheme i be try to put through 
sir rather than be annoy further with this chimerical idea of your i will pay five thousand dollar spot cash just to have -PRON- give over -PRON- notion and quit experiment 
professor quinn laugh 
five thousand dollar -PRON- exclaim then add as though to -PRON- -PRON- would have -PRON- sell the welfare and happiness of the people for five thousand dollar will add another five thousand to offer put in gilhooly not because i be afraid -PRON- discovery will upset the transportation interest of the country but simply to clear the commercial atmosphere and keep -PRON- visionary idea from affect the price of stock 
let -PRON- add another five thousand say meigs donot see how -PRON- invention even if -PRON- be all -PRON- claim for -PRON- could affect -PRON- or -PRON- interest one way or the other but i will add -PRON- contribution simply because popham have take the initiative 
count -PRON- in for the same amount supplement markham on the condition that professor quinn sign over to the four of -PRON- all -PRON- right title and interest in -PRON- nongravity invention and covenant to leave that field entirely alone in future 
quinn seem to enjoy these proposition and -PRON- be apparent at a glance that -PRON- have no intention of accept twenty thousand dollar and renounce -PRON- discovery 
gentleman say -PRON- -PRON- be already half convinced that i be no dreamer for -PRON- be financier and while twenty thousand dollar be no more to -PRON- than twenty cent be to -PRON- -PRON- be not -PRON- habit to give -PRON- money away 
i repeat that -PRON- be inclined to have faith in -PRON- and before many minute i shall have make -PRON- belief in -PRON- ability complete 
be i to understand that -PRON- decline -PRON- offer demand popham 
most decidedly 
then there be nothing more to be say 
come on gentleman and popham start toward the door moment more if -PRON- please request the professor 
not another second cried popham 
-PRON- offer be withdraw and if -PRON- socalled discovery amount to anything -PRON- shall find other mean for make -PRON- ineffective 
i have be interested in proceeding to an extent that have all but cause -PRON- to forget -PRON- purpose 
the plutocrat be about to leave the castle in a temper and if i wrest tribute from -PRON- -PRON- must be now or never 
start up i draw -PRON- revolver and run hastily down the iron stair 
-PRON- unexpected advent upon the scene prove as startling as i have anticipate 
even the professor be dash 
step in front of the steel door i toy menacingly with the revolver and survey the plutocrat with a grim humor i make no attempt to conceal 
at that period of -PRON- life inspire by the sophistry to which i have already advert i be a cool and dangerous man 
pardon -PRON- for enter unannounce say i blindly 
-PRON- have listen to professor theory and witness -PRON- demonstration 
i be but an humble philosopher yet i have a theory of -PRON- own which i should also like to expound and to demonstrate 
who be -PRON- sir demand quinn be a bird of like feather with these -PRON- guest say i facetiously albeit -PRON- method be more direct if less extensive 
-PRON- name be jam peter munn -PRON- specialty be robbery of the variety for i have the courage of -PRON- conviction and do not hide behind a technicality do not wish to intrude -PRON- presence here longer than necessary to accomplish -PRON- design and if these amiable gentleman will aid indicate the amiable gentleman with -PRON- revolver will take -PRON- departure quietly from the castle here i scowl trust or other will be minus -PRON- guide power in case any resistance be attempt 
the threat be sufficient and the usual sunny smile return to -PRON- face as i add mr gilhooly will advance to the table spread -PRON- handkerchief upon -PRON- and lie thereon -PRON- watch and fob the ring on -PRON- finger the kohinoor in -PRON- tie and the wallet in the breast of -PRON- coat 
-PRON- be -PRON- theory that one thief have the right to take from another property that do not belong to either of -PRON- 
-PRON- be mr privilege to give the first demonstration 
fidelity to truth force -PRON- to chronicle the above speech 
the clat with which i make -PRON- be far from -PRON- now as i pen -PRON- verbatim 
there be speech in life which -PRON- could wish unsaid and this one of mine i would give much to consign to the limbo of thing unspoken 
reformation have work wonder in -PRON- since that evil time 
i will say for mr gilhooly that -PRON- be alacrity -PRON- in carry out -PRON- command 
-PRON- hand tremble a little as -PRON- place -PRON- belonging on the handkerchief and knot the four corner over the plunder as i request 
the professor smile strangely sink down on the divan and watch proceeding with twinkling eye 
-PRON- manner fill -PRON- with a foreboding i try not to manifest 
evidently this amuse -PRON- cry gilhooly in anger -PRON- snap eye on the professor 
-PRON- inference be correct mr gilhooly answer quinn be profoundly amused 
-PRON- be all so unexpected so dramatic and souseless 
by gad sir cry popham see more in this than a desire on -PRON- part to interest capital in a fake discovery 
there be a plot here gentleman and -PRON- turn to the other three 
-PRON- folly in allow -PRON- to be lure to this place be stupendous 
i make no doubt but that there be a plot here between this man quinn and this thief 
quinn get -PRON- in the thiefs power and the thief do the rest pretty scheme snap meigs 
clever very clever put in markham 
and successful too growled gilhooly with a regretful look at the plunder on the table 
but there will be a reckon 
when -PRON- be once clear of this place -PRON- can set the police at work 
i be surprised at the way quinn take this talk 
-PRON- continue to smile and be in no way ruffle wrong there cry hot and indignant 
professor quinn have nothing to do with -PRON- being here have -PRON- eye on this castle for a long while and i let -PRON- in just before -PRON- come hope to make a haul and get clear 
-PRON- interrupt -PRON- and i stow -PRON- away upstairs 
from what i see and hear i must say that -PRON- be a pleasure for -PRON- to turn -PRON- back on professor property and to give -PRON- entire attention to -PRON- four 
mr munn say quinn how long have -PRON- be engage in this business 
for some year now sir i answer 
-PRON- be honestonce 
every man be bear honest if -PRON- come to that 
i use to work in an iron foundry but the work be take over by a combination and a lot of -PRON- be throw out of employment 
there be nothing for -PRON- to do but begand above that 
this come handiest and i go into -PRON- 
i like the business 
match one wit against the law keep one constantly in the midst of alarm so to speak and i like excitement 
and i have ability for never yet have i wear the stripe or learn the lockstep 
i have write some on the subject of -PRON- vocation in the hope of beguile other into the work dangerous man mutter gilhooly 
what be -PRON- come to clamored popham 
here be a thief who be actually proud of -PRON- profession and who actually write book about -PRON- 
merciful heaven gasp meig in horror feel sorry for -PRON- country when -PRON- produce such man be totter on the verge of chaos add markham in a stage whisper 
i laugh at all this for i enjoy -PRON- hugely 
spare yourself any needless worry about -PRON- gentleman say look to home and -PRON- will probably find enough there to fret -PRON- conscience 
professor quinn continue to take pleasure out of the queer situation can honor a man like munn say -PRON- where i be tempt to despise man like -PRON- gilhooly meig markham and popham 
as munn say -PRON- have the courage of -PRON- conviction 
-PRON- do not take from the poor for in the very nature of thing -PRON- can not 
-PRON- loot come from those who be able to lose -PRON- while -PRON- be vampire and sap the very lifeblood of the nation 
-PRON- be all criminally delude although perhaps do what -PRON- conscientiously believe to be exactly right 
would to heaven and here the professor grow suddenly sincere and intensely earnest that something would conspire to open -PRON- eye to the exact truth 
but i have despair of that and i be try in -PRON- own feeble way to meet the present emergency 
-PRON- be either a fool or a madman cry popham rattlebraine zealot chime in meigs 
-PRON- be the one who should see thing differently say markham 
-PRON- preach a doctrine which -PRON- fail to apply personally 
enough of this talk gentleman i interpose 
-PRON- situation be precarious and i must ask -PRON- to hurry a little 
sir shout popham level a forefinger at -PRON- shall see -PRON- properly jail for this 
why -PRON- miserable footpad i can save -PRON- breath i interrupt tartly meet -PRON- forefinger with the muzzle of the pepper box 
lead be no respecter of person 
one of -PRON- have call -PRON- a dangerous man 
i be all of that and desperate 
mr popham -PRON- see how mr gilhooly carry out -PRON- order 
-PRON- will proceed in the same manner and without further loss of time 
in five minute i must be out of here 
-PRON- start to argue the point with -PRON- and i allow -PRON- forefinger to flex ever so slightly upon the trigger 
that be enough 
a man value -PRON- life in a direct ratio with what -PRON- consider -PRON- importance therefore the esteem in which these four millionaire hold -PRON- must have be overwhelm 
the honorable augustus popham finally yield up -PRON- personal property with the same readiness that have characterize -PRON- friend 
hannibal markham follow -PRON- and after markham come archibald meig 
i have a pleasant word for each as i marshal the four bundle string -PRON- on the finger of -PRON- left hand and back toward the door which be a few pace behind -PRON- 
when a good general beat a retreat say prepare to pull open the door and let -PRON- out -PRON- place as many obstacle in the path of the pursue force as possible 
when i leave therefore i shall lock this door on the outside 
i be watch by the plutocrat in philosophical silence by the professor with a geniality that nothing seem able to shake 
i have spare quinn because -PRON- be a friend of the poor as i have discover 
and i have be poor -PRON- some fifteen minute back say i airily 
au revoir answer the professor 
look well where -PRON- step 
i throw open the door with a laugh 
the laugh fade into a shout of terror 
i throw out -PRON- hand revolver and packet of loot fall through the door and i only barely save -PRON- with one foot over the threshold 
the horror that grip -PRON- then be such a horror as come to a man but once in a lifetime 
-PRON- brain sicken and chill -PRON- heart all but stop -PRON- beating and -PRON- limb grow rigid 
in the black of the fearsome nightnot the atmospheric blueblack i have be accustom to but the ebony dark of erebusi see a wild greenish star below a huge disk whose gleam nimbus dance on -PRON- sight in quiver line 
half craze i fling back into the room and fall grovel to the floor -PRON- ear echo with the professor merriment and the startled exclamation of the four man i have robbedall to no purpose 
presently i sit up rub forehead and eye 
the professor stand in the open door gloat over the vista below 
come -PRON- call beckon to the huddled quartet at the other side of the room 
come gilhooly meigs popham and look down upon the scene of -PRON- feverish activity 
-PRON- be plutocrat there more powerful than king 
here -PRON- be no more than shoulder high with -PRON- and yon muddle thief on the floor 
-PRON- have be snatch from the scene of -PRON- pernicious laborsexile into planetary space where -PRON- will be powerless to work further evil 
i have not live in vain for this this be the triumph of -PRON- career 
slowly meig disentangle -PRON- from the mute group by the opposite wall and creep on all four to the threshold that overlook the void and the greenish star 
-PRON- recoil with a yell then madden by what -PRON- have see -PRON- leap erect and try to hurl -PRON- out into space 
fool cry the professor lay hold of -PRON- and struggle to keep -PRON- back 
would -PRON- become a satellite of this planet 
-PRON- be beyond the atmosphere of the earthlook 
see the four packet of loot and the thief revolver 
-PRON- point through the door and the bulge handkerchief and -PRON- sixshooter be abreast of -PRON- hang in space turn slowly weirdlya sight to upset the strong mind 
gilhooly jump forward give vent to a maniacal laugh then crumple down on the floor 
bid up for the -PRON- mumble bid to the limit 
i must have that will have -PRON- 
brace up meig say the professor sharply pull the key from the outer side of the lock slam the door fasten -PRON- and put the key in -PRON- pocket 
take care of gilhooly man 
-PRON- mind falter 
heaven be -PRON- all mad 
be -PRON- keen mind unshaken in the contemplation of vast deal for the enslavement of the poor so quick to break 
i have think well of -PRON- than this 
meig white as the spotless linen that cover -PRON- breast advance upon the professor 
-PRON- try to speak but without success 
at last with a supreme effort the word come madman what have -PRON- do 
that be better return the professor smile as -PRON- look at meig and note how markham and popham range -PRON- at -PRON- side much well 
-PRON- be engage in plot back there on the earth and the success of those plot would have prove a great calamity 
i have save the world from the calamity castle have rise from the earth ask meigs 
-PRON- have fall off the earth 
as -PRON- and i and the other happen to be inside -PRON- fall with -PRON- 
sudden rage convulse meig 
-PRON- crouch downward -PRON- eye ablaze and -PRON- finger work convulsively 
scoundrel -PRON- scream and launch -PRON- at the professor throat like a tiger 
look back now at that dreadful hour when the realization of -PRON- awful predicament burst upon -PRON- i wonder that i preserve -PRON- own equilibrium 
the first shock come near to throw -PRON- off -PRON- poise but after that i gain the whip hand of -PRON- wit by swift and sure degree 
i verily believe the professor would have be strangle by meig aid and abet by popham and markham have i not rush to -PRON- rescue 
i have muscle of iron and after i have catch meig by the nape of the neck and throw -PRON- backward i plant -PRON- between quinn and -PRON- foe 
leave the professor alone say -PRON- man show mighty poor judgment -PRON- strike -PRON- in try to lay violent hand on -PRON- 
-PRON- deserve death babble meig 
-PRON- have no business shoot -PRON- into space in this summary manner 
fear and anger have make meigs childish 
-PRON- measure -PRON- dilemma in term so common a smile come to -PRON- lip 
judgment poor judgment sniffed popham 
look at gilhooly and then talk about poor judgment if -PRON- can 
in truth the railway magnate present a sorry spectacle 
-PRON- clothing be in wild disorder -PRON- hair be rumple about -PRON- head and -PRON- be hop back and forth with two finger in the air 
-PRON- be under the impression that -PRON- be deal in railroad stock complete the huge transaction that have make -PRON- the talk of two continent 
this professor ought to be flay alive declare markham 
where be -PRON- go and when will -PRON- get there 
now say -PRON- be strike the keynote 
who know where -PRON- be go if the professor doesnot 
and who know when -PRON- shall arrive there if -PRON- be out of -PRON- power to tell 
-PRON- need the professor for if -PRON- be to be save -PRON- will be -PRON- knowledge that do -PRON- 
but what will -PRON- family think whimper meig 
and -PRON- business interest 
-PRON- throw up -PRON- hand and fall back in -PRON- seat with a groan 
then abruptly -PRON- straighten up again 
this be a dream 
by gad -PRON- must be 
the whole affair be too outrageously unreal for any sane man to believe 
gilhooly give a maudlin chuckle be dead sure get that last block of stock 
that road be the last span in -PRON- network of tie and rail 
ha 
now well see 
now meig shiver maundering strike sharply at -PRON- desire to coddle -PRON- with a myth awful to have gilhooly like that speak up augustus popham 
if -PRON- have not be throw out of balance -PRON- wide knowledge of matter relate to transportation may have prove of inestimable service to -PRON- now 
professor quinn laugh 
-PRON- be an eerie laugh and -PRON- shake -PRON- to hear -PRON- 
oh -PRON- cry markham reproachfully whirl on quinn 
after cause this disaster and overthrow as brilliant a mind as there ever be in wall street -PRON- have the heart to indulge in levity 
look here how far be -PRON- from the earth at the present moment 
that be a difficult matter to estimate even approximately answer quinn calmly 
ordinarily gravity exert a force that can be measure definitely on the earth surface 
a body fall freely from rest acquire a velocity which be equal to the product of thirtytwo and onefifth foot and the number of second during which the motion have last 
what be the time now 
three gentleman reach for -PRON- watch fail to find -PRON- and turn hard look on -PRON- 
i appreciate -PRON- dilemma and draw from -PRON- vest an openface timepiece that be personal property and honestly come by 
-PRON- be twelvefifteen say quinn take a pencil and notebook from -PRON- pocket and do some figuring 
-PRON- may be a little more than two mile from -PRON- native planet say -PRON- but only two mile cry the three exile in chorus 
-PRON- can take -PRON- back sir say popham who have be pace the floor nervously 
shut off the power of this infernal machine and let -PRON- drop back to where -PRON- belong 
two mile be no great matter 
-PRON- castle be a slow freight compare with some of express train can not take -PRON- back sir return the professor and i would not if i could 
-PRON- do not hear -PRON- out 
the law of velocity recite for -PRON- benefit a moment ago do not measure the speed of this car 
no murmured markham 
decidedly not 
the earth sweep along in -PRON- orbit at the rate of eighteen mile to the second while some aerolite and meteoroid attain a speed of twenty and thirty mile to the second 
in build this car i equip -PRON- with an antigravity block gear up to fifty mile to the second 
the lever on the here quinn turn and point to throw so as to give -PRON- the maximum 
in other word say popham feebly -PRON- be sail skyward at a rate ofof three thousand mile perper minute 
presumably 
as -PRON- leave -PRON- city lot in new york at about elevenfifteen -PRON- follow that -PRON- have be one hour on the way 
and should be one hundred and eighty thousand mile from home falter meigs 
about that answer the professor calmly do not know just how much -PRON- progress be impede by the atmospheric envelope of the earth but i think -PRON- may call -PRON- distance from the mother orb some one hundred and eighty thousand mile in round number 
these startling figure come near to unsettle the three gentleman again 
in that flight through space -PRON- be confront immensity wellnigh beyond -PRON- puny comprehension 
and the professor be not yet do 
in the storeroom overhead -PRON- continue have a supply of cube and insulating compound which i can combine and give tremendous add velocity to the car be sure -PRON- be travel fast enough say meig lean back on the divan hopelessly deject 
if -PRON- be now ready to listen to reason proceed quinn will tell -PRON- how mr munn here save -PRON- life by rescue -PRON- from -PRON- mad attack 
-PRON- life forsooth exclaim markham bitterly 
of what value be life to -PRON- situate as -PRON- be 
that be one way to look at -PRON- of course rejoin quinn caustically 
but i do not exile -PRON- into planetary space for the purpose of wipe -PRON- out of existence 
-PRON- may as well have do so say popham severely 
that be what this harumscarum plot of yours amount to in the long run 
-PRON- may not care to learn how i be preserve -PRON- at the present moment continue quinn nor how i shall do so in the future yet i will tell -PRON- so that -PRON- may understand how much -PRON- owe to mr foresight and courage 
i be begin to entertain a high regard for quinn in spite of what -PRON- have do 
-PRON- may have be labor under terrible delusion but -PRON- resource certainly command respect 
to -PRON- forethought -PRON- continue be due the fact that -PRON- be breathe oxygen at this moment and have i not invent a liquid which fortifie animate or inanimate body against heat and cold -PRON- rush through the atmosphere of the earth would have incinerate this car and -PRON- contentsnay would have cause -PRON- to explode and settle back on -PRON- native planet in impalpable powder 
these be thing that none of -PRON- aside from the professor have so much as take thought of 
-PRON- respect for -PRON- be grow into something like awe and i fancy i detect trace of the same sentiment in the other three 
there be rove body in space quinn go on note with apparent satisfaction the interest -PRON- have arouse with which -PRON- may come into collision 
i have a good telescope at the observatory window upstairs and while i can not guide this car i can at least increase or slacken -PRON- speed so as to dodge any other derelict that may come into dangerous proximity with -PRON- -PRON- better be up there on the lookout query markham in some trepidation 
-PRON- be manifest an interest in -PRON- personal safety that please the professor 
there be not much danger at present return quinn 
when -PRON- have plunge farther into the interstellar void -PRON- will be well to stand watch and watch about at the telescope 
will -PRON- not be possible to land on some other planet mar for instance query popham with sudden hope should prefer mar add meig reflect the hope show in -PRON- friend face 
-PRON- have be signal from mar and perhaps -PRON- can find out what -PRON- want over there 
quinn shake -PRON- head 
-PRON- be in the hand of fate gentleman say -PRON- 
-PRON- may drop into some port but what that port will be be beyond -PRON- power even to surmise 
the moon isnot so far off suggest markham 
only two hundred and forty thousand mile say quinn 
-PRON- should be there in less than two hour from the time of start remark meig after a mental bout with the figure 
if i wish say quinn could increase -PRON- speed travel at the rate -PRON- be however something will have to be deduct for the resistance of the earth atmosphere 
if -PRON- drop on a planet -PRON- must be a planet with an atmosphere 
the moon have none and consequently be a dead world 
besides fate may not throw -PRON- into -PRON- vicinity or just a minute sir interpose markham for i be a man who like to understand thoroughly every situation with which -PRON- be call upon to deal 
-PRON- invite -PRON- to -PRON- castle not i be constrain to believe to have -PRON- victimize by munn here nor to have -PRON- invest in any of -PRON- discovery but to snatch -PRON- away from the scene of -PRON- labor 
be that correct professor quinn 
entirely so mr markham reply quinn 
evidently proceed markham -PRON- plot have cost -PRON- some time and labor 
-PRON- have first to find -PRON- gravityresisting compound the plot follow as a result of -PRON- discovery smile the professor do not first evolve the plot and then go search for mean to get -PRON- off the earth 
when i have make the discovery -PRON- remain for -PRON- to give -PRON- to the worldor to better the world by take -PRON- four gentleman away from -PRON- 
have i give the public the benefit -PRON- shrewd man of affair may have devise mean for set -PRON- aside or for control -PRON- 
not be a business man -PRON- i fear to take chance 
for that reason the present enterprise appeal to -PRON- 
-PRON- have plan so well in the small detail that i wonder -PRON- overlook the main point 
and that be what -PRON- be go to do with -PRON- now that -PRON- plan have succeed 
the professor toss -PRON- hand deprecatingly as though that be really the most insignificant part of -PRON- startling scheme 
-PRON- canot go bob around through interstellar space grumble popham donot relish the idea of be cribbed cabin and confine in a steel room indefinitely 
i should go mad from the very thought awful to contemplate say meig cast a melancholy glance through the iron latticework at one of the window 
the bag of loot be in that vicinity at the moment and -PRON- glance swerve reproachfully to -PRON- 
-PRON- shall make a landing i have no doubt say the professor soothingly somehow and somewhere 
by gad sir cry popham bring -PRON- fist emphatically down on the table donot like such a way of do thing 
whenever i set out to accomplish anything the goal be always clear in -PRON- mind yet here i be through no desire of -PRON- own afloat in the great void without a single aim or a remote prospect 
if -PRON- be go to land anywhereand -PRON- remain firm in -PRON- decision not to take -PRON- back to -PRON- native demand that -PRON- make landfall on some orb that be worth while 
very good popham approve meigs 
unless i be greatly mistaken that be the very idea markham have in mind when -PRON- begin question the professor 
eh markham 
-PRON- be reply markham full knowledge of where -PRON- be go be necessary to a thorough understanding of remarkable situation 
now there be world large than the one -PRON- have recently leave 
personally i be predispose in favor of a large planetone on which there be traction interest fuel supply and product of the soil similar to those -PRON- have be accustom to 
under the spell of word popham begin to glow and expand 
meig all attention press a little close 
the big the planet the big -PRON- field of operation cry popham the matter with jupiter 
or saturn echo meigs 
or neptune put in markham the matter with the whole solar system inquire quinn with gentle irony 
-PRON- turn to -PRON- 
observe mr munn how extravagant be the idea inspire by monopoly 
these gentleman be hardly start on -PRON- journey into space before -PRON- forget the business interest the friend and the environment -PRON- be leave behind and begin plan the commercial conquest of the star 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head forebodingly 
-PRON- regeneration -PRON- add to the millionaire call for a landing on some barren world some outcast of the solar system where -PRON- will have nothing to do but think over the evil of -PRON- past and learn something of the duty -PRON- owe -PRON- fellowmen 
popham markham and meig be visibly annoy by the professor remark 
withdraw as far as the limit of the steel structure would allow -PRON- put -PRON- head together and hold a brief but animate conversation in tone so low that the professor and i could not overhear 
think of that professor 
i mutter 
and yet there be people who find fault with a respectable burglar 
softly mr munn return quinn 
before -PRON- be do with this journey i be fain to believe that all of -PRON- will have a different outlook upon life and a high regard for -PRON- duty of citizenship 
just then popham turn from -PRON- friend and step toward the professor 
-PRON- manner be truculentprobably just such a manner as -PRON- be accustomed to use in face a board of obstinate director 
if -PRON- will not return -PRON- to -PRON- native planet professor quinn say -PRON- sharply then -PRON- shall stand upon -PRON- right 
-PRON- be unalterably oppose to land upon any orb whose diameter measure less than at that instant a most astounding thing happen 
the car duck sideways throw the whole structure out of plumb 
loose article begin to drop from shelf and other place and to slide across the floor to the low point 
by a quick movement i save the lamp and brace -PRON- in an upright position 
cry of terror go up from markham meig and popham 
gilhooly shout the professor 
-PRON- be answer by a wild yell from overhead in the storeroom cry quinn 
follow -PRON- with that lamp the professor rush for the stairway and i make after -PRON- with what speed i could 
there never live a man i suppose who do not at some time or other in -PRON- career submit -PRON- veracity to question 
a reformed burglar therefore although animate by the most disinterested motive can scarcely hope to escape the shaft of the incredulous 
although wellgrounde in the science of cracksmanship and with some store of legal learning as to alibis and so forth -PRON- mind be as empty of astronomical lore as a drained bottle 
the professor saying be jot down in a sort of commonplace book at a later day when leisure offer 
memory may have play -PRON- false in some few minor point but in all of major importance this narrative be to be take with the same sincerity in which -PRON- be write 
i ask no more of the reader than that and if -PRON- be not averse to stroll through unfrequented way touch elbow with a man who have a past -PRON- shall get along famously 
to return then to the steel car and the obliquity -PRON- suddenly present to the direction of -PRON- course 
startling disclosure have somewhat obscure gilhooly and -PRON- have vanish from the low room without be miss 
for a man of sixtyfive the professor be very agile and -PRON- take the winding iron stairway two step at a time 
i gain the storeroom close behind -PRON- and there -PRON- find gilhooly croon to -PRON- and work like mad 
-PRON- be not work in the dark but have possess -PRON- of -PRON- lantern which i have leave on descend from the loft some time before 
mount on a pile of pack case -PRON- be engage in paint a large steel cube take -PRON- pigment from an open cask with a whitewash brush 
-PRON- antigravity compound exclaim the professor in an irritated tone 
there be several block on the floor as -PRON- can see gilhooly begin paint that one and -PRON- rise as insulation proceed lodge to the left of the dome and tilt the car 
this be the shabby lot of coach i ever see in -PRON- life say gilhooly dab away with the brush wonot own a road with such rolling stock 
the three man downstair have follow quinn and -PRON- 
after some coax meig get gilhooly to descend from -PRON- perch and give up the whitewash brush 
thereupon the cube be pry over until -PRON- rest directly under another block in the point of the dome and the professor finish the insulation begin by the railway magnate 
gilhooly will have to be watch say quinn or -PRON- will play havoc with the material i have store up here 
-PRON- have waste at least a quart of that antigravity mixture and -PRON- be worth -PRON- weight in gold 
nay -PRON- be worth more than that for after this supply be exhaust there will be none to be have for love or money 
-PRON- rate of speed have be multiply by two and -PRON- be rush through space with frightful rapidity 
there be -PRON- the professor point to the instrument which stand beneath a window in the slope roof of the car 
suppose gilhooly have demolish that 
or what if -PRON- have wreck the oxygen vat or the antitemperature reservoir 
gentleman i shudder to think of what may have happen 
the professor sink down on a copper tank and brush -PRON- perspiring brow with a bandanna handkerchief 
i place the lamp on a box beside the lantern and recline on a bale of something or other that lie conveniently near 
meig and popham drop down on a packing case with gilhooly moor between -PRON- and markham take up -PRON- station on an overturn cask 
the loft of the car store as -PRON- be with odd and end of science together with a supply of provision make ready for -PRON- by the farsighted and wonderful man who be conduct this select party into the unknown be an object of deep solicitude and interest 
out of a desire to tag the various material understandingly i lift the lid of -PRON- curiosity and let out a few question 
if i mistake not say -PRON- mention this antitemperature material once before 
what be -PRON- professor liquid -PRON- answer amiably 
as a discovery -PRON- be outrank only by -PRON- antigravity compound 
an ounce of the fluid in a bath render the bather impervious to heat or cold keeping in the animal caloric and keep out all other extreme of temperature 
some of the mixture be incorporate into the paint with which this car be coat 
yonder be the water receptacle and the professor nod toward a large tank opposite -PRON- 
with economy the supply in that reservoir will last -PRON- several month 
the food i have provide be of the readyprepare kind mostly in tin with an alcohol lamp for the brewing of tea coffee and chocolate 
during this hegira into infinity i have omit nothing gentleman which will minister to -PRON- comfort 
-PRON- be a very able man professor acknowledge popham 
how long have -PRON- be plan this little excursion 
ever since i begin erect what the harlemite be pleased to call -PRON- castle smile quinn 
the plan be conceive at the time the success of the manipulation of -PRON- and -PRON- friend seem assured 
-PRON- be -PRON- purpose to foil the speculative gentleman i strike in and so come to the aid of a longsuffere public 
-PRON- hit off the matter finely mr munn reply the professor 
that be -PRON- purpose 
could not -PRON- antitemperature mixture have be donate to the poor with beneficial result 
-PRON- be altogether too expensive for general use 
i will not conceal from -PRON- gentleman the fact that -PRON- be fall sunward 
if -PRON- make landfall on a planet where the heat be several hundred degree beyond -PRON- earthly power of endurance the mixture in question will preserve -PRON- 
fall sunward exclaim markham 
-PRON- be hard upon midnight when -PRON- leave the earth 
if -PRON- schoolday learning be not at fault the sun at the hour of -PRON- departure be on the opposite side of -PRON- planet 
how then do -PRON- happen that -PRON- be fall toward the great luminary 
bravo cry the professor vastly pleased be glad to see mr markham that -PRON- intellect have not suffer a total eclipse by the demand of commercial supremacy 
night be the result of one of the hemisphere be turn from the sun and other thing be equal -PRON- should now be fall toward the outer limit of -PRON- solar system but if i may use the term the castle be not aim for a direct fall from the earth crust 
-PRON- drop at a very sharp angle and the influence of the sun have attract -PRON- still farther out of a straight course 
i trust -PRON- follow -PRON- 
the three millionaire understand the situation but judge from the expression of -PRON- face the knowledge bring keen disappointment 
there be only two planet between the earth and the sun observe markham mercury and venus if i remember rightly 
both insignificant grumbled popham 
venus be about the size of -PRON- own planet gentleman say the professor 
however -PRON- have long be suppose that there be another group of planet between mercury and the sun among -PRON- a little world call vulcan which that do not interest -PRON- cut in meigs 
sunward the planet be small but -PRON- get large as -PRON- go the other way 
larger expound the professor but less dense 
as i be about to tell -PRON- a moment ago pursued popham meig markham and i have decide that either saturn or mar would about fill the bill so far as -PRON- be concerned 
there be light on mar which as -PRON- figure -PRON- presuppose electricity and electricity mean civilization to a degree that afford -PRON- a promising prospect 
then again there be canal on mar and if canal certainly water transportation 
transportation problem of any sort will interest gilhooly indeed -PRON- be prone to think -PRON- would bring -PRON- back to -PRON- normal poise 
saturn on the other hand have ring and such a condition may afford opportunity to wideawake man such as be unknown anywhere else in the solar system 
take -PRON- either to mar or to saturn professor quinn as -PRON- may find -PRON- most convenient 
-PRON- demand -PRON- 
-PRON- be impossible to do anything of that kind mr popham return the professor decidedly 
the influence of the sun upon -PRON- course be too powerful 
be -PRON- to understand then cry markham that -PRON- be compel to put up with either mercury or venus 
even there gentleman -PRON- have no choice 
-PRON- be in the grip of circumstance and must perforce accept whatever fate throw -PRON- way 
possibly -PRON- shall become a satellite of the sun revolve around and around planet the small of any in the great system 
although i feel drowsy i arouse -PRON- with an effort and keep sharp eye on the professor face 
i do not think -PRON- be in earnest but merely talk to see what effect -PRON- remark would have on the three millionaire 
corner corner corner babble gilhooly make a corner corner everything 
markham drop -PRON- face in -PRON- hand meig bow -PRON- head and i see a shiver run through popham 
egad mutter popham this castle of yours quinn be little short of a steel tomb 
inasmuch as -PRON- be safely inter what s the use of living 
gilhooly be the only fortunate one among -PRON- for -PRON- reason be shatter and -PRON- can not realize what -PRON- be face 
-PRON- be talk less like a man now popham reprove quinn than like a drivel idiot 
while there s life there s hope 
how many brilliant mind have be overthrow as a result of -PRON- manipulation of stock in wall street 
how many bright future have be wreck by an adverse trend of the speculative market 
be those unfortunate any better off because thrust into madhouse and unable to realize the fate that have overtake -PRON- 
for shame sir 
-PRON- be perfectly sure be -PRON- professor i strike in attempt to give a more pleasant twist to the conversation that -PRON- shall come out all right in the end have -PRON- plan mr munn -PRON- answer not unkindly and the success or failure of -PRON- will depend largely upon the mental attitude of these gentleman 
this be too deep for -PRON- and i cast about for some equally important question which would bring a less indefinite response 
anyhow say -PRON- have plenty of food for a long journey 
-PRON- would be a fearful thing to have a famine soso many mile from a base of supply 
the food supply mr munn answer the professor be adequate 
there will be no famine 
and the water the oxygen the have look after everything necessary to -PRON- safety and comfort 
i have confidence in quinn 
-PRON- have show that -PRON- be an able man and that -PRON- promise be to be take at face value 
with a sigh of relief i settle back in tolerable comfort 
meig take the role of questioner out of -PRON- hand at this point and although i be eager to hear all that be say tired nature sweet restorer get the well of -PRON- curiosity and i fall asleep on the bale 
-PRON- be not -PRON- purpose to cumber this narrative with the small detail of -PRON- journey novel and thrill though some of -PRON- prove to be 
-PRON- be with -PRON- experience on the planet which finally claim -PRON- that this account have mostly to do so i shall glide over intermediate incident in a somewhat cursory manner 
-PRON- faculty key to an understanding of earthly condition only find -PRON- continually at bay and at nothing do -PRON- stand more aghast than at the lightninglike speed with which -PRON- shoot through space 
the energy develop by the two insulate cube give to -PRON- steel car the stupendous velocity of one hundred mile per second six thousand mile per minute three hundred and sixty thousand mile per hour 
human reason may well falter at the threshold of such immensity 
yet while i sleep peacefully on that bale in the storeroom these figure be verify by the professor and archibald meig who happen to be the only two who be wide awake 
-PRON- have be -PRON- lasting regret that -PRON- do not rouse -PRON- so that i may also have have a view of the noble spectacle for the first time unroll to earthly eye 
-PRON- pass the moon a dreary burnedout world and the professor be able to check off two hundred and forty thousand mile of -PRON- sunward plunge 
-PRON- have travel a little more than half an hour at -PRON- ultimate velocity take this into consideration and note the exact minute when -PRON- cross the centre of the satellite orbit the professor be able to do some figuring and so test -PRON- theory as to speed 
the car skim through ether less than five hundred mile above the lunar crust 
quinn be doubly pleased for -PRON- not only prove that -PRON- velocity be substantially as -PRON- have suppose but also discover that the moon attraction so powerful on the tide of -PRON- mother sphere could not swerve the car by a hair breadth from -PRON- direct course or overcome the influence of the sun 
meig tell -PRON- later that the marvelous beauty of the satellite gleam against the black void with ghostly radiance be probably worth the trip and -PRON- attendant inconvenience 
-PRON- and quinn have look -PRON- fill on the hemisphere which be never see from the earth 
after this the hour literally fly past the novelty of -PRON- journey preclude any such thing as monotony 
in fact -PRON- hardly allow -PRON- a sufficient amount of time for rest and refreshment 
a lookout be keep continually at the eyepiece of the telescope to signal the approach of any asteroid with which -PRON- may possibly come into collision 
only once do this danger threaten -PRON- and then as may be suppose -PRON- be the professor who prove -PRON- salvation 
the lever in the wall of the lower or living room of the car communicate with screen ingeniously arrange for shut off the power of the antigravity cube 
by lessen -PRON- speed the professor suffer the asteroid to cross -PRON- course -PRON- car duck through the luminous trail that sweep out behind -PRON- 
night reign around -PRON- constantly 
-PRON- car catch the ray of the sun -PRON- be true but the lack of an atmosphere cause the light to be throw back into space and lose 
the castle be nothing less than a small planet attend by five satellite which hold to -PRON- vicinity by the car attraction circle around -PRON- continually 
these satellite be the four knot handkerchief contain the tribute i have levy upon the plutocrat and also the revolver which have assist -PRON- in the work 
these object go through varied phase exactly as more pretentious satellite would have do 
-PRON- would be difficult to describe -PRON- feeling as i watch -PRON- from the car window 
i be prone to think at the present writing that this lose booty wax and wane under -PRON- eye plant in -PRON- nature those first seed of regret which finally grow into a reformation 
i recall a conversation that i have with markham while i sit with -PRON- eye at the low end of the telescope watch for stray asteroid 
the millionaire have give -PRON- to understand that i be not in -PRON- set circumstance over which -PRON- have no control have bring -PRON- together within the narrow confine of the car but no social barrier have be level 
occasionally the novelty of -PRON- situation and the consequent excitement would cause one or other of the wealthy gentleman to forget the gulf that yawn between -PRON- 
this attitude of the magnate afford -PRON- a good deal of innocent enjoyment 
-PRON- have leave social prestige no less than -PRON- bank account behind -PRON- and what little collateral -PRON- have have upon -PRON- person be now satellite about the car 
the line -PRON- draw between -PRON- and -PRON- in -PRON- thoughtful moment be a distinction without much of a difference 
markham i remember be munch a sandwich contrive out of two cracker and a slice of tin beef 
do -PRON- never reflect mr munn say -PRON- upon the evil of -PRON- past 
when a man write book which be mainly draw from -PRON- own experience mr markham say -PRON- have to go into -PRON- past pretty exhaustively 
ah yes i be forget about the book 
be -PRON- not horrified with the result of -PRON- retrospection 
horrified 
well yes here and there 
i lose a big haul once through the breaking of a jimmy and i be horrified to think how any dealer in burglar kit could have foist such an unreliable instrument upon a wellmeane cracksman 
markham stare at -PRON- dazedly have set down the experience in chapter one of forty way for crack safe i proceed and one of the first of -PRON- ten rule for success in any safecracking job be this be sure that -PRON- kit be reliable and without flaw 
mr munn mr munn whisper markham hoarsely 
think of the people from whom -PRON- have take property dishonestly never think of -PRON- but to wish that i have be able to relieve -PRON- of more 
this be awful mutter markham 
-PRON- really exult over what -PRON- have do 
-PRON- would have start down the iron stair have i not restrain -PRON- with a word 
let -PRON- ask -PRON- something mr markham say last fall bread go to ten cent a loaf because the wheat market be corneredand a man by the name of markham do the cornering 
the people who have to put up that extra five cent miss -PRON- more than do those from whom i take five hundred dollar 
markham cough 
any asteroid in sight -PRON- inquire absently wonder if -PRON- ever do any reflect 
i ask tartly 
what do -PRON- think of quinn and markham look away as i take -PRON- eye from the telescope and give -PRON- an expressive wink donot think i continue that -PRON- ever write a book call forty way to starve the poor 
-PRON- have material enough for a pretty effective volume on the subject but -PRON- havenot -PRON- nerve 
no -PRON- return slowly havenot -PRON- nerve 
-PRON- require unalloyed impudence and a mind incapable of clear thinking to liken the result of high finance with those of -PRON- own petty and highly criminal proceeding 
-PRON- be too bright a man mr munn to allow -PRON- to be lead afield by sophistry of that kind 
mr markham mr markham 
i breathe in horrified protest 
-PRON- have bolster up -PRON- nefarious business with false ideal -PRON- go on and -PRON- be unregenerate and lose 
this be awful 
i murmur 
when -PRON- get to where -PRON- be go pursue markham either fail to note -PRON- sarcasm or else hope to ride -PRON- down trust -PRON- will hold -PRON- criminal instinct in check 
if there be any people there donot give -PRON- any false ideal or implant the notion that -PRON- standard belong to the rest of -PRON- would not so belittle -PRON- ideal i return bluntly 
sir -PRON- cry sharply be i to understand that -PRON- set -PRON- up as be any well than mr popham mr gilhooly mr meig or -PRON- 
what -PRON- understand doesnot concern -PRON- in the least i answer airily 
what -PRON- donot understand -PRON- strike -PRON- be the matter that ought to claim -PRON- attention 
confound -PRON- sir 
-PRON- overwhelming ignorance be equal only by -PRON- colossal egotism 
i be sorry that i allow -PRON- to be beguile into any talk with -PRON- 
-PRON- regret be mutual say for -PRON- conversation be demoralize 
-PRON- be a past master in successful trickerytrickery of the sort that ought to be stamp out 
if the law be as quick to deal with -PRON- as with -PRON- hold fume markham plunging for the stair have hear enough 
i have say that i be a hard man in those time 
i could call a spade a spade with never a thought that -PRON- angle of vision be distort 
i have regret express -PRON- view in this frank fashion to markham yet i believe that there be injustice in -PRON- remark no less than in mine 
be the only person in the car who possess a watch the professor appoint -PRON- official timekeeper 
-PRON- be -PRON- duty to bulletin the hour with -PRON- equivalent in day such as -PRON- be accustom to upon a blackboard in the low room i have also to enter this information upon a book which the professor call the logbook 
every ten hour -PRON- have a class in astronomy with the professor as instructor and with every man save gilhooly and the lookout as student 
the railway magnate aberration continue all -PRON- could do be to watch -PRON- solicitously and prevent -PRON- from do any injury to -PRON- or to -PRON- paraphernalia 
the class learn that the near planet with an atmosphere and supposedly habitable be venus which at inferior conjunction be distant some twentyfive million mile from terra as quinn call -PRON- own planet 
count out the delay at start and in maneuvre to escape the asteroid -PRON- instructor assert that -PRON- should reach venus in something like seventyfive hour 
markham meig and popham on consult the bulletin board and find that seventy hour have pass begin to brush -PRON- clothe and tidy -PRON- against the hour of landing 
but -PRON- be destine to disappointment 
unable to locate venus at the point where -PRON- have hope to find -PRON- the professor decide that -PRON- be near superior conjunction and be somewhere on the other side of the sun 
meig make a deplorable display of temper 
quinn be a mighty poor astronomer -PRON- say sneeringly if -PRON- could find -PRON- so far wide of the mark on such a simple matter 
meig further addedwith a good deal of childishness as i thoughtthat the role of a derelict be distasteful to -PRON- a derelict -PRON- argue be nothing more than a tramp and -PRON- object to be a tramp even a celestial tramp 
i be out of patience with the man 
admiration for the professor have take fast hold of -PRON- and i would not have -PRON- sneer at or malign 
a war of hot word be on between -PRON- and the wall street broker when quinn interfere 
true say -PRON- -PRON- have miss venus by a few million of mile but -PRON- be aim directly at the orbit of another world and i can so manipulate the lever as to wait for -PRON- if necessary and drop upon -PRON- surface when -PRON- overtake -PRON- 
what world be that say popham prick tip -PRON- ear 
mercury answer the professor 
-PRON- be the small orb in -PRON- solar system and measure some three thousand mile in diameter think venus be rather contract for man with such large scheme as -PRON- remark meig shake -PRON- head but this other planet seem to be small still wonder if -PRON- have coal mine there murmur popham meditatively 
and if -PRON- grow wheat and cotton add meig 
if mercury be inhabit speak up markham eagerly food will certainly be as necessary there as on the earth 
i donot know gentleman but -PRON- strike -PRON- -PRON- may fall into bad place 
poor gilhooly sigh meigs 
what a pity -PRON- will be if the mercurial prove to have traction interest 
how long before -PRON- shall reach this planet -PRON- speak of professor inquire popham 
well answer quinn thoughtfully mercury be rather slow 
-PRON- travel along -PRON- orbit at the rate of thirty mile per second while -PRON- be move at one hundred mile 
at a rough estimate i should say -PRON- can effect a juncture with the planet in ten hour although an extra hour may be require for maneuvre to secure a landing 
the ten hour that follow be hour of great anxiety and feverish labor 
believe that -PRON- nerve be the steady the professor place -PRON- at the telescope to act as pilot while -PRON- serve as engineer and manipulate the lever 
the responsibility of -PRON- position so work upon -PRON- that i have no time for the glory of the planet -PRON- be endeavor to intercept 
through the telescope i see huge mountain and broad plain but -PRON- be blur over with a reddish light and the less detail of topography be lose 
when five hour be go the professor leave the lever and come upstairs to have a look through the telescope for -PRON- 
-PRON- have do very well indeed mr munn -PRON- be pleased to say but i think that i have well take this post from now on while -PRON- go below and station -PRON- at the switch board 
the slight mismanagement when the critical moment arrive may hurl -PRON- against mercury with a force that would result in annihilation 
the lever turn in a half circle as -PRON- may know 
the arc be divide into space number from zero to ninety 
i will call down to -PRON- the number to which -PRON- must throw the lever -PRON- will repeat the number back to -PRON- and instantly obey -PRON- order 
trust -PRON- sir say but the professor be loath to let -PRON- go without still further impress upon -PRON- the importance of the work before -PRON- 
in order to alight safely mr munn -PRON- continue -PRON- must graduate the power of the antigravity cube to the mercurial atmosphere 
by proceed intelligently in the matter -PRON- shall make the car weigh slightly more than the atmosphere -PRON- encounter then when -PRON- be about to land -PRON- will let the car just counterbalance the pull of the planet and there will not be the slight jar understand professor i answer and go downstairs 
markham meig and popham ascend to the upper chamber this position bring -PRON- a few foot nearer the goal of -PRON- desire as well as give -PRON- a point of vantage from which to watch event 
gilhooly be the only one besides -PRON- in the low room -PRON- be kneel on the divan write imaginary stock quotation on the steel wall with the point of -PRON- finger 
for four hour or more the professor call out for slight variation in the speed of the car but in the main the lever be hold on the number which give a maximum velocity 
the tension of the minute usher in the last hour of the ten be beyond -PRON- power to describe 
once in -PRON- evil day i manipulate the tumbler of a combination and pull open a vault door 
behind the door stand two man with revolver 
for two second i stare agape at the trap which i have spring upon -PRON- and when i get away i have a bullet in -PRON- shoulder 
intensify -PRON- feeling fourfold as i stand look into the level revolver of those two man then spread out the two second to cover a half hour 
in this way only can i describe -PRON- state of mind while -PRON- fight for a safe landing on the planet mercury 
cry of wonder and apprehension echo to -PRON- from overhead 
above -PRON- i hear the shrill voice of the professor zero 
zero i repeat throw the lever clear over 
there follow a jolt as the screen cover the cube and shut off -PRON- energy 
instantly there come the sicken sensation of a fall accompany by a rush of displace air that roar and bellow all about the car shriek quinn 
i yell throw the lever half over 
then -PRON- catch -PRON- with a suddenness that throw -PRON- to -PRON- knee 
-PRON- be move upward could feel the steel floor rise under -PRON- 
twenty come down from above 
twenty i answer hoarsely struggle erect and shift the lever 
i feel that -PRON- be still rise but slowly 
the professor be juggle with an unknown atmosphere and on the success of -PRON- judgment depend -PRON- life 
fifteen 
fifteen and over go the lever for five degree 
-PRON- be swinge stationary in midair 
from the window by the switch board i look outward and downward with bulge eye 
a dazzling glow cover peak and plain and i turn away that -PRON- sight may not be blind to the lever number 
ten cry the professor 
ten -PRON- be and i throw the switch to the number give 
then again -PRON- drop but slowly very slowly 
five 
i repeat the order and again the air rush against the blunt base of the car yet not so fiercely as before 
then all of a sudden i feel a grip of finger about -PRON- throat and i be haul from the lever and throw back on the floor 
gilhooly have a knee on -PRON- breast and be strangle -PRON- with finger of steel 
the fire of an insane purpose gleam in -PRON- eye and -PRON- seem possess of the strength of a dozen demon 
i struggle but i may as well have try to rise under the thousandton pressure of a hydraulic press 
ten cry quinn 
i do not could not for -PRON- tongue be loll between -PRON- lip 
ten scream quinn be lose a groan hardly audible escape -PRON- gasping throat 
i hear a frantic clamor above and then there be such a jar and crash as i hope i shall never experience again 
all tangible life slip away from -PRON- and i collapse into an unconsciousness that i feel may be death -PRON- 
a that -PRON- life be preserve and the car save from destruction be due to two circumstance one of -PRON- most peculiar and of farreache importance 
the less of the two circumstance be this the car have not drop to the plain but have have -PRON- downward rush intercept by an elevation so that the force of -PRON- fall be just about half what may have be expect 
as to the other and more vital circumstance the fall -PRON- be not what -PRON- would have be on -PRON- own sphere 
the pull of gravity on mercury as -PRON- afterward discover have only onethird the power -PRON- have on terra 
to this phenomenon be due many wonderful thing as the reader will discover before -PRON- have go very far 
i be not the first of -PRON- party to open -PRON- eye after the landing for when i sit up and stare about -PRON- i see the professor move around the steel chamber and minister to the other 
gilhooly be creep toward the divan on all four mutter something about a great slump in the market and chuckle over the way in which -PRON- have get out from under 
archibald meig be groan and try to lift -PRON- on -PRON- elbow augustus popham be on -PRON- knee wobble erratically and apparently undecided whether to say -PRON- prayer or to try and get up hannibal markham be flatten out along the floor the professor kneel over -PRON- and chafe -PRON- temple 
what sort of a navigator be -PRON- quinn ask meig crossly 
by gad -PRON- be more dangerous to make port with -PRON- than -PRON- be to sail through space blame the professor for a fault of mine meig i speak up warmly 
the broker look at -PRON- with something like contempt blame -PRON- for place an incompetent and irresponsible person at such an important post as the switch board say meigs 
-PRON- should have know that a man who hold -PRON- distorted view on the subject of personal property be not to be trust right add popham lift -PRON- to the divan 
gilhooly make an attack on -PRON- say -PRON- bear -PRON- down and come within one of strangle -PRON- 
quinn be the cause of abnormal condition persist meig who be bind to have quinn at fault for every evil that overtake -PRON- 
i get up rather more wrathful than the situation demand 
the fall have jar -PRON- temper no less than -PRON- body and i be in a mood to have the business out with meig at close quarter 
softly mr munn caution the professor 
-PRON- be well to have a deaf ear for these gentleman at time 
help -PRON- lift mr markham to the divan 
the professor word dispel -PRON- anger 
without another word to meig i go over and assist in get the food trust magnate into a more comfortable position 
markham be not long in recover and when -PRON- take stock of -PRON- -PRON- find that -PRON- be not much the bad for -PRON- shake up 
quinn call to -PRON- to go upstairs with -PRON- and see if any havoc have be work there 
-PRON- find that no particular damage have be do to the instrument or other material 
when -PRON- descend to the low chamber after an absence of fifteen or twenty minute meig have the key in the steel door and be stand at the entrance with popham and markham on either side of -PRON- 
where do -PRON- get that key demand the professor one hand grope in -PRON- pocket 
heretofore -PRON- have be careful to keep the key upon -PRON- person 
small wonder that -PRON- be now surprised to find -PRON- in the possession of meig find -PRON- on the floor reply the broker with a good deal of dignity 
probably -PRON- lose -PRON- out of -PRON- pocket when -PRON- fall from the stair a few minute ago what be -PRON- intend to do ask the professor quietly 
professor quinn sir return meig with elaborate condescension -PRON- have reach the parting of the way 
while -PRON- be travel through space i and -PRON- friend could do nothing less than bear with -PRON- company and with that of the rogue at -PRON- side but now that -PRON- be safely moor on mercury and can debark -PRON- see fit to withdraw -PRON- and renounce further intercourse with -PRON- 
ah murmur quinn a slow smile hover about -PRON- thin lip 
the smile cause some acerbity to manifest -PRON- in the three gentleman at the door 
-PRON- draw -PRON- up haughtily 
quinn go on the broker sharply -PRON- lure -PRON- into -PRON- castle and abduct -PRON- from -PRON- native orb with small regard for the feeling of -PRON- relative or friend and no consideration whatever for the business interest with which -PRON- be engage so -PRON- business interest have -PRON- every consideration interrupt the professor 
meig take no notice of the remark 
so -PRON- continue remember these wrong -PRON- feel that -PRON- can no longer associate with -PRON- 
as for -PRON- turn a fastidious eye in -PRON- be utterly impossible to man of -PRON- social standing 
this planet -PRON- tell -PRON- be three thousand mile in diameter 
may -PRON- request that -PRON- and munn take one end of the diameter and leave the other end to -PRON- 
the professor laugh softly and seat -PRON- 
sit down mr munn say -PRON- 
-PRON- have be ostracize by -PRON- fellowexile 
let -PRON- see how well -PRON- get along without -PRON- 
-PRON- bid -PRON- farewell finished meig loftily 
thereupon -PRON- turn the key throw open the doorand drop on the threshold as though -PRON- have be shoot 
markham and popham cry aloud throw -PRON- arm across -PRON- face and reel back 
a blast as from a furnace drive in at the opening fill the chamber like a draft from hade 
i could scarcely breathe in the stifle atmosphere 
hurry munn cry quinn 
drag meig away from the door or hell be burn to a crisp 
the broker be already smoke when i catch -PRON- ankle and jerk -PRON- inside 
the professor slam the door 
presently the air within the car readjust -PRON- to normal condition 
meig red as a beet and breathing heavily be little the bad for -PRON- warm experience fancy mr meig coo the professor that -PRON- will wish to avail -PRON- of one of -PRON- antitemperature bath before cut loose from -PRON- and mr munn 
there be plenty of water leave for all of -PRON- and i will go aloft set up the collapsible tub and make the bath ready 
-PRON- have alight in the tropic evidently and at the period of midsummer 
the temperature be about five hundred degree fahrenheit 
with that the professor take the key from the door to keep gilhooly from make a dash outside and start for the storeroom 
i follow -PRON- the three disgruntle gentleman gaze after -PRON- mutely 
the professor and i be the first to fortify -PRON- with the antitemperature bath 
after dip -PRON- body -PRON- rinse -PRON- clothing in the liquid 
aside from a pleasant cool sensation the bath give no evidence of -PRON- potent quality 
there be no hardening of the skin as i fancy there may be no change in -PRON- ruddy color no inconvenience 
when -PRON- go down again -PRON- send the other three gentleman aloft the professor instruct -PRON- as to the necessity of make -PRON- clothing as well as -PRON- body proof against the climate 
in due course popham meig and markham once more show -PRON- 
gilhooly of course have also to be make immune and -PRON- struggle against -PRON- so fiercely that -PRON- be oblige to hold -PRON- in the tub while the professor pour three bucket of the mixture over -PRON- 
-PRON- be not disrobe and when sufficiently drench -PRON- leap from the tub and flee rave to the low chamber 
now say the professor -PRON- be prepared to fare forth 
-PRON- address -PRON- to markham meig and go with mr munn and -PRON- or keep by yourself as -PRON- may elect 
but -PRON- will be well to make this car -PRON- headquarters 
here -PRON- have food and drink also a stronghold in case of attack by the there happen to be any 
how can there be any life in such an overheat atmosphere inquire markham 
nature be a great leveler of barrier reply quinn 
-PRON- be able to adjust life to -PRON- environment -PRON- may be sure just as easily as -PRON- can bridge the social chasm that separate a thief from a trust magnate 
-PRON- eye twinkle 
such a bridge -PRON- add would not prove much of a tax on -PRON- resource 
for -PRON- own part i do not think the chasm either so wide or so deep as -PRON- gentleman appear to imagine 
i chuckle at that and meig and -PRON- two companion grow duly resentful 
as for mr gilhooly continue quinn -PRON- can not take -PRON- with -PRON- on -PRON- tour of observation 
-PRON- will be good to leave -PRON- lock in the car 
i will close the trap lead into the storeroom and i do not think -PRON- will be possible for -PRON- to work much damage in the room below donot know what good -PRON- will do -PRON- to go out with -PRON- explore expedition say popham dejectedly in a country as hot as this there can be no earthly use for coal 
or wear apparel add meig listlessly 
cotton couldnot grow in such a temperature 
and as for wheat 
-PRON- shake -PRON- head wearily 
cotton and wheat be the abc of -PRON- wall street experience 
beyond those commodity -PRON- grope in the dark 
what sort of food can be grow on such a sunbaked planet grumble markham 
the railway man be shout something about water stock and -PRON- babbling be waft up to -PRON- 
gilhooly add markham be the only fortunate man in the party 
realization will blast the hope and mayhap prove the death of the rest of -PRON- while hehe can not realize 
-PRON- gentleman lose courage too quickly say the professor 
in -PRON- lecture on venus i tell -PRON- how that planet be incline to the plane of -PRON- orbit 
the axis of mercury have a still great inclination in fact the orb lean on -PRON- as though about to fall 
-PRON- day be of about the same length as the day of three minute longerbut -PRON- year owe to -PRON- contract orbit be much short 
in eightyeight day mercury make -PRON- round so that each season be only twentytwo day in length 
at the pole of mercury in what answer to the polar region of -PRON- own earth there must be a more tempered climate then let -PRON- get there by all mean cut in popham 
in whatever -PRON- do answer quinn -PRON- must make haste slowly get out and look around anyhow cry meig 
-PRON- may happen after all that -PRON- have a world to conquer here and i have not the patience to remain longer in this steel cell of yours 
very good return the professor 
-PRON- will make -PRON- preparation and go forth 
-PRON- shut off the flow of oxygen from the tank and then follow the rest of -PRON- to the under apartment close a steel door over the trap at the head of the stair and lock -PRON- 
gilhooly imagine -PRON- a conductor be walk around the edge of the circular divan collect ticket from imaginary passenger 
sing sing -PRON- call out as the professor unlock the door at the entrance and pull -PRON- open where -PRON- get off munn say meig maliciously where -PRON- all get off return the professor smile 
thereupon -PRON- pass hastily into the blind glare of the mercurial day 
for several minute -PRON- eye rebel at the brightness when finally -PRON- become inured to -PRON- -PRON- look around -PRON- upon a desolation that strike dismay to -PRON- heart 
-PRON- see then that -PRON- car have alight upon an elevation which be nothing less than the rim of an extinct volcano of vast proportion 
from ridge to ridge across the abysmal crater at least half a mile could be measure 
-PRON- be beyond the power of -PRON- eye to penetrate to the black depth of the great pit 
listen cry the professor -PRON- voice resound so thunderously as almost to deafen ussome trick of the atmosphere 
-PRON- stand silently -PRON- ear alert and hear a confused babel of sound proceeding apparently out of the very core of the volcano fire may be at work down there whisper the professor nodding toward the crater 
even the whisper sound unpleasantly loud to -PRON- 
what a world come from augustus popham in bellow tone 
with fire within and without what chance be there for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
some of meigs peevishness have get into the coal man and -PRON- rent the air with -PRON- 
-PRON- remain mule after this outburst i with -PRON- gaze hopefully on the professor and the professor blink at the sun 
in a little time i allow -PRON- own eye to falter zenithward and the glory of the sun in midheaven have ever since be one of the treasured memory of -PRON- life 
-PRON- disk be six time -PRON- diameter as view from earth and the grandeur of -PRON- flaming surface be beyond the power of -PRON- feeble pen to make known 
i be oppress and hold captive by a feeling of awe and wonder 
there be a red tinge to the atmosphere cause by a reflection from the red of the planet bricklike crust through this warm color pulse the golden streamersyellow and scarlet overhead fade to faint orange on the horizon 
think -PRON- mr popham murmur the professor -PRON- voice awaken -PRON- as from a trance that all yon splendor which have be in these sky for age upon age be create for the enjoyment of no live thing 
if so -PRON- be wrong 
there be now as there have always be being with an intelligence capable of appreciate all this magnificent profusion of light and color 
but enough 
-PRON- have look down into the crater and up into the heaven suppose -PRON- turn -PRON- eye another way and see what there be to offer 
-PRON- face about as -PRON- speak and gaze down the bare rocky slope of the volcano and off across an equally bare and forbid plain 
no tree no water no life of any kind mutter meig querulously 
there be a bright spot over there say quinn shade -PRON- eye and point 
-PRON- eye follow -PRON- finger and encounter a glittering object on a slight elevation 
as -PRON- gaze the object whatever -PRON- be slowly vanish 
-PRON- may investigate that suggest popham excitedly 
perhaps -PRON- be a mercurial wear a sort of armor to protect -PRON- from the heat 
-PRON- may be that there be people here and that -PRON- live underground 
-PRON- would have start forthwith but the professor stretch out a hand and detain -PRON- 
just a moment say quinn 
before -PRON- get too far from the car let -PRON- make sure that all of -PRON- be sufficiently immune from the heat 
do -PRON- feel that -PRON- be fully protect in that respect gentleman 
so far as i be personally concerned i have not feel the slight inconvenience from the sun ray 
i declare as much and the other likewise so express -PRON- another one of the thing speak up meig point in another direction 
-PRON- be just able to detect a glow on another low elevation when -PRON- also flash into thin air 
then -PRON- begin look for the little hill and count no less than a dozen within -PRON- range of vision 
some of the hill be cap with the mysterious gleam which dazzle for a time and then twinkle out 
the professor be perplex as i could see plainly examine one of those hill say meig and find out what this mean 
the top of the volcano where -PRON- be stand be perhaps five hundred foot from the plain 
as meig speak -PRON- leap for a rock a yard or so below -PRON- 
to the astonishment of all of -PRON- -PRON- rise in the air like a human balloon soar over the rock by a score of foot and alight several rod down the slope 
-PRON- be a titanic jump but meig have regain a foothold with the lightness of a piece of down 
-PRON- be a large man be meigs -PRON- ponderosity exceed two hundred pound fairbank 
-PRON- be as much surprised at -PRON- agility as -PRON- be and begin to essay various feat 
-PRON- leap straight upward gain a maximum height of a dozen yard and return lightly and easily to -PRON- original position 
next -PRON- couple -PRON- leap with an aerial somersault and carry on with an abandon much beneath the dignity of a wall street broker as -PRON- strike -PRON- 
in fact -PRON- act like a schoolboy out for a holiday and so full of animal spirit -PRON- hardly know what to do with -PRON- think -PRON- belong to a circus observe the disgusted popham go down there and put a stop to the performance 
and go along and help add markham visibly distract because of the broker folly 
-PRON- start down the steep with rodlong step and presently one would have think -PRON- wear sevenleague boot from the amount of speed -PRON- develop 
instead of put a stop to the broker performance -PRON- join in 
by and by -PRON- be play leapfrog every bound take -PRON- forward half a hundred foot 
gravity here be far from have the force -PRON- have on terra remark the professor 
exertion come easy and give most astonishing result 
those man mr munn be not use to such activity yet -PRON- marvelous gymnastic do not seem to tire -PRON- in the least 
suppose that -PRON- -PRON- make a test of the mercurial gravity 
i need no second bidding and quinn and i take the descent as buoyantly as thistledown before the wind 
somehow the lightness of -PRON- heel get into -PRON- head and the staid professor and -PRON- begin cavort like a pair of tenyearold 
the delightful freedom of movement be as novel as -PRON- be exhilarate 
liberty of muscle breed license of mind have -PRON- be smoke opium -PRON- could not have act more outrageously 
nor be there any fatigue apparent 
i feel that i could have run a hundred mile in as many minute and never pause for breath 
carry away by the wonderful effect of diminished gravity -PRON- forget all about -PRON- project investigation of the little hill 
in the midst of a game of tag -PRON- be suddenly bring to -PRON- sense with a round turn 
a pall have fall over the landscape 
the sun be blot out by inky cloud and a tremendous wind begin to blow 
-PRON- must get back to the car cry quinn 
-PRON- voice great in volume though -PRON- be be all but drown in the shriek and roar of the blast 
the lightness that have afford -PRON- so much enjoyment in still air now become a source of grave danger for -PRON- could not keep -PRON- foot in the fury of the temp 
merciful power roar popham as -PRON- and meig be drive against each other with a terrific impact 
although sorely put to -PRON- to keep -PRON- from be blow away i manage to cling to a rock and watch the weird gyration of the two millionaire 
-PRON- collision have cause -PRON- to lose -PRON- footing and cling desperately to each other -PRON- be hurl back and forth touch the ground now and then only to rebound from -PRON- like rubber ball 
and all the time this tumbling be go on both man be whoop frantically for some one to come to -PRON- aid 
i be too hard beset to think of leave -PRON- place of temporary refuge and -PRON- be only when i see the professor and markham -PRON- right hand clasp stagger toward the two man that i make up -PRON- mind to join -PRON- 
three of -PRON- in a chain may be able to do something toward rescue popham and meig 
breathe deep like a swimmer about to plunge through a whirlpool i cast -PRON- adrift and allow the wind to drive -PRON- in the direction of the professor and markham 
no matter how strongly i brace backward against the blast every time i lift a foot i be hurl onward and almost overturn 
finally more by good luck than anything else i come close enough to catch the professor hand 
popham and meig will be kill if -PRON- canot get to -PRON- shout markham 
there be eddy in the wind like those in the swift current of a stream and popham and meig have become entangle in -PRON- 
have -PRON- be blow off on a straightaway course -PRON- would long since have be too far away for -PRON- to do anything toward lay hand on -PRON- and get -PRON- upright 
the professor have take note of the gyratory movement of -PRON- hapless companion and -PRON- call upon markham and -PRON- to plant -PRON- as firmly as possible and remain in -PRON- present position 
this be easy say than do yet by call upon every ounce of -PRON- reserve strength -PRON- contrive after a fashion to keep -PRON- place 
popham and meig be bound and leap through the arc of a great circle 
all -PRON- have to do be to remain where -PRON- be and wait for -PRON- 
-PRON- come to -PRON- in midair and -PRON- have literally to reach up and pull -PRON- down 
for a space the five of -PRON- be tangle in an indiscriminate heap -PRON- united weight offer great resistance to the wind and give -PRON- an opportunity to rest and collect -PRON- scatter wit 
join hand cry the professor and well get under the lee of that rock 
careful now 
-PRON- must not get separate again 
by desperate work -PRON- succeed in get to -PRON- foot and clasp hand then hurl and buffet -PRON- gain the rock and fall breathless under the leeward side of -PRON- 
what a place what a place groan popham wish venus hadnot be out of -PRON- course wail meig 
certainly -PRON- couldnot have be any bad off there than here 
no wonder nothing can grow on this sunscorched world growl markham 
even if plant could stand the heat such a wind would pull -PRON- up by the root 
what be -PRON- to do now demand popham 
-PRON- get -PRON- into this quinn and -PRON- have get to get -PRON- out of -PRON- a good time for -PRON- three to go off to the other side of the planet i remark 
whenever there s danger -PRON- suddenly realize that -PRON- canot get along without the professor 
oh -PRON- be a fine lot of nabob -PRON- be 
peace mr munn call the professor 
-PRON- have enough to occupy -PRON- mind without waste time in useless bickering 
i be at fault for i know what terrible gale visit this planet and that -PRON- come suddenly 
-PRON- be a mistake to venture so far from the car mistake breathe meig with some heat that come near have tragic consequence 
popham and i be knock about like a couple of football to be do what s to be do cry popham impatiently 
the gale be increase and who know but this rock may be pluck up bodily and roll over -PRON- 
-PRON- canot stay here 
that be true say the professor 
-PRON- must get back to the car no tell what will become of -PRON- if -PRON- try that call markham 
and there s no tell what will become of -PRON- if -PRON- remain here answer the professor 
if -PRON- form a chain -PRON- be quite possible that -PRON- may succeed in get back to -PRON- refuge 
even the car may not be able to stand up against this wind clamor meig 
-PRON- shall have to take -PRON- chance with -PRON- nevertheless go on quinn 
if -PRON- should get separate each of -PRON- must make the good preparation -PRON- can to weather the gale and then when -PRON- have blow -PRON- out hunt for the car 
that must be -PRON- rendezvous during the time -PRON- be here 
the professor get up slowly brace -PRON- against the fierce swirl that come around the side of the rock 
come -PRON- call -PRON- be now or never 
i could see that the gale have increase alarmingly 
-PRON- force seem irresistible and yet i know that -PRON- could not remain where -PRON- be 
-PRON- clasp hand again but be unable to cling together be lift high and throw helterskelter in all direction 
lightning flashedsuch lightning as i have never see before or since 
-PRON- snap and crackle overhead and run like trail serpent over the rock 
-PRON- be in a sea of flame 
and the thunder 
-PRON- seem to split the heaven and crack open the lavalike hill 
rain come yet not rain for -PRON- turn to damp vapor in the redhot atmosphere 
the mercurial element be at warwind steam thunder and lightning all marshal -PRON- host and charge to conflict 
to regain the steel car be impossible 
-PRON- be lose in the fearsome fury of darkness and storm drive helplessly and with smash force across the vast plain 
i be hurl against something which i grip with convulsive energy 
the something grip -PRON- in return 
help 
i cry bereft of -PRON- wit and eager only for rescue 
munn shout a voice 
be this -PRON- 
quinn 
i exclaim 
-PRON- must hang together say quinn 
and then tightly lock in each other arm -PRON- be lift high on a billow of fog and drive relentlessly i know not how far 
when the blast release -PRON- -PRON- fall to the rock and roll over and over then the surface beneath -PRON- give way and -PRON- drop 
the distance -PRON- fall could be only a matter of guesswork and even guesswork be out of the question in the disordered state of -PRON- mind at that moment 
suffice to say the fall do not render -PRON- unconscious and -PRON- strike on something that vibrate under the impact of -PRON- body 
-PRON- be still in blank darkness and the turmoil of the temp no longer beat about -PRON- but could be hear crash somewhere overhead 
thank heaven murmur the professor withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- 
be -PRON- alive mr munn believe so i answer 
what have happen to -PRON- professor 
-PRON- have be fling into some sort of a shelter -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- reply 
but -PRON- be not on stable ground -PRON- add 
-PRON- be sit on an object that be descend with -PRON- descend rapidly andah wonder of wonder 
abruptly -PRON- fall into broad day surround by such sight and sound that i think -PRON- deal with the mystery of a disordered dream 
professor quinn and i be sit on a large box construct of metal that be polish to dazzle brilliancy 
so far as -PRON- purpose be concern this box be nothing less than an elevator -PRON- have fall upon -PRON- and -PRON- have carry -PRON- down into the wonderful interior of the planet 
now truly -PRON- be in another worlda world that teem with lifea smile and pleasant region underlie a most barren and inhospitable shell 
the scoriate exterior of the planet be the husk here be the kernel 
-PRON- be a white world extend league on league in every direction and roof with a lofty vault that sparkle as with star 
from every hand come a beelike hum proving that -PRON- be in a hive of industry and life 
house spread out before -PRON- in row queerly shaped structure that look as though -PRON- may have be build of alabaster and so diminutive that the tall scarcely come more than head high 
back of the house be field thickly cover with nodding blossom that look like snow through the field run waterway divide each into small square 
so intent be -PRON- on the background of this strange picture that -PRON- fail to take account of what be go on in -PRON- immediate vicinity 
suddenly a weird creature hop to the top of the box and stand between -PRON- companion and -PRON- regard -PRON- fixedly 
this i suppose be one of the mercurial 
if -PRON- consider the professor and -PRON- object of curiosity and surmise -PRON- be no less keen in so regard -PRON- 
-PRON- stand twentythree or twentyfour inch high -PRON- head be an ivory billiard ball and -PRON- trunk a large spheroid from -PRON- middle downward hang a red kirtle 
-PRON- have one eye at the front of the head and an ear at the back the olfactory organ be miss but there be a mouth opening perpendicularly under the eye 
the upper spheroid rest directly on the low and at each side of the low one correspond to the shoulder be two tentaclelike arm sinuous as whip and end in hand that be make up of a palm and seven digit 
queerest of all there be two more arm set in the breast and back 
from the creature shoulder be suspend a round object like a canteen 
for all of five minute quinn and i eye this surprising figure and be eye in return 
can -PRON- talk english ask the professor at last 
-PRON- be a foolish question such as i be far from expect from the professor but something have to be say and i suppose that be as good as anything else 
as the professor begin speak the head whirl squarely around present the ear 
after -PRON- companion be do the head spin back again and the breast arm catch the canteen while the finger of a shoulder arm begin manipulate a set of key 
the result be language with all the variation of tone and accent 
but -PRON- be an unknown tongue if an expression of that kind may be allow in such a case 
since the wordbox be as ineffective as -PRON- own speech -PRON- fall back with more success on the language of sign
